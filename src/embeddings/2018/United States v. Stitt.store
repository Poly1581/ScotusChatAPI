ROSS: So, Your Honor, I think\n\nthey are not encompassed by these statutes.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n9\n\n1 And I think that our definition turns on\n\n2 whether most states would, in fact, have\n\n3 included that person.\n\n4 So I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s encompassed\n\nby this statute because, again, I think even\n\n6 the homeless person that you\u0027re hypothesizing\n\n7 would change their vehicle in some way that\n\n8 might put a burglar on notice.\n\n9 But even if you disagree with me on\n\nthat, no state case -- as Respondent Sims\n\n11 readily admits in the brief, no state case has\n\n12 applied it to a vehicle in which someone\n\n13 happens to live. And that\u0027s not just true of\n\n14 Arkansas.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"7","file_name":"United States v.

I know you want to run straight to\n\nthis case, and I appreciate that, but -- but\n\n6 live with us for a moment in the unease of the\n\n7 more general concern that Justice Breyer\n\n8 raised.\n\n9 If you survey circuit judges across\n\nthe country about one gripe they have with this\n\n11 Court\u0027s jurisprudence, it may be the ACCA you\u0027d\n\n12 hear a lot. And the -- maybe the fourth option\n\n13 I sometimes hear is why not do an Erie, instead\n\n14 of Swift versus Tyson, and say, well, if the\n\nstate calls it robbery, if the state calls it\n\n16 burglary, then it\u0027s robbery or burglary.\n\n17 And I\u0027d be curious, and -- and I\u0027m not\n\n18 holding you to any of it, but has the\n\n19 department given any thought to any of these\n\noptions that Justice Breyer has outlined or\n\n21 that I\u0027ve just added?\n\n22 JUSTICE KAGAN: May I add a fifth?\n\n23 (Laughter.)\n\n24 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Please.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Because I know there","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"21","file_name":"United States v.

MR.\n\nFISHER: Right.\n\nThe Court did\n\n4 look to state law in Taylor, but, as I said, it\n\nalso looked to legislative intent and the\n\n6 drafting history and the like.\n\n7 And I think Taylor was correct insofar\n\n8 as it went at that time that you still would\n\n9 have covered a majority of the states, even if\n\nTaylor covered vehicles adapted for overnight\n\n11 accommodation. The switch happened in Mathis.\n\n12 That\u0027s when the government came to the\n\n13 Court and said, if you have an aggressive\n\n14 divisibility jurisprudence, that\u0027s going to\n\nleave aside many state laws because of\n\n16 divisibility reasons. So the answer to the\n\n17 state law concern is in Mathis. And that\u0027s the\n\n18 bridge the Court has already crossed and that\n\n19 the government doesn\u0027t ask the Court to -- to\n\n-- to revisit.\n\n21 If we\u0027re talking about Congressional\n\n22 intent, I think there\u0027s one other important\n\n23 thing to put on the table in the text of the\n\n24 law, and that\u0027s the residual clause.

hypothesizing, somebody is in inside\n\n3 and there is a violent altercation, those cases\n\n4 aren\u0027t charged as burglary. They\u0027re charged as\n\nthings like carjacking, robbery, assault.\n\n6 So the burglary convictions, and this\n\n7 is what the Sentencing Commission found when it\n\n8 backed burglary out of even the crime of\n\n9 violence provisions in the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, it found that when burglary is\n\n11 charged, it\u0027s in the cases where nothing\n\n12 happened but the entry.\n\n13 And so that may well still satisfy the\n\n14 categorical definition of burglary under ACCA,\n\nthe residential entry, because of the awareness\n\n16 and because of the inherent risk, but once you\n\n17 go beyond primary residences and talk about\n\n18 things that are hardly ever occupied and that\n\n19 people are going to target specifically because\n\nthey\u0027re hardly ever occupied, walking down to\n\n21 the -- to the -- to the marina with a sleepy\n\n22 sailboat on the dock and rummaging through the\n\n23 contents, those are the kinds of things that\n\n24 Congress, I don\u0027t think, would have expected to\n\nbe swept up and any sensible definition of ACCA\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"60","file_name":"United States v.

that\n\n8 might well be true.\n\n9 I also think that Taylor itself was\n\nlooking at a definition of \"building.\" And\n\n11 Congress in 1984 was looking at a definition of\n\n12 \"building\" that had taken on its own very broad\n\n13 meaning in burglary law.\n\n14 If you look at the appendix to our\n\nbrief in this case, most, if not all, of the\n\n16 states that actually defined \"building\" did so\n\n17 in terms of vehicles, other structures, et\n\n18 cetera.\n\n19 So they had a very broad definition\n\nthat might not make sense in ordinary English\n\n21 but was what state burglary statutes used. And\n\n22 so, when this Court comes along in Taylor and\n\n23 says building or structure, it\u0027s really just\n\n24 explicating that.\n\nAnother way to look at this is through\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n69\n\n1 the LaFave treatise that we obviously rely on\n\n2 in the briefs, which similarly makes clear that\n\n3 those -- that both \"building\" and \"structure\"\n\n4 were often broadly construed.\n\nAnother point that I just wanted to\n\n6 clear up with respect to the government\u0027s\n\n7 position in Mathis. I don\u0027t think it is true\n\n8 that the government said that all of the\n\n9 statutes that it noted would, in fact, be out\n\nif Mathis came out the way it did.
