SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\n9 Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\nSudan seeks to reverse a $300 million\n\n11 judgment in favor of the USS Cole victims based\n\n12 on an unstated procedural requirement.\n\n13 Sudan argues that the Cole victims\n\n14 improperly served their complaint by sending it\n\nto the Sudanese Embassy, a component of the\n\n16 foreign ministry, where it was signed for and\n\n17 accepted.\n\n18 The relevant provision of the FSIA\n\n19 does not contain Sudan\u0027s requirement that the\n\ncomplaint be sent to the address of the\n\n21 headquarters of the foreign ministry in the\n\n22 foreign state. And even if the relevant\n\n23 provision were ambiguous, Sudan\u0027s proposed\n\n24 interpretation is not necessary to comply with\n\nthe Vienna Convention, which does not prohibit\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n35\n\n1 service by mail at an embassy.\n\n2 Consistent with the plain language of\n\n3 the FSIA, the court of appeals correctly held\n\n4 that service in this case was proper and its\n\njudgment should be affirmed.\n\n6 I\u0027d like to start --\n\n7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\u0027ve done a little\n\n8 bit of research on the service of process rules","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"32","file_name":"Republic of Sudan v.

Well, I\u0027m not going to\n\n16 say you\u0027re wrong, Justice Breyer, but I will\n\n17 address what I think were really the three\n\n18 parts of your question: first, text; second,\n\n19 policy; and, third, the practice of other\n\ncountries.\n\n21 So, with regard to the text, as you\n\n22 know, our submission is quite simple. It\u0027s not\n\n23 that this is an ambiguous provision. It\u0027s that\n\n24 it\u0027s a broad provision. And the best evidence\n\nof that is that in the very next paragraph,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n43\n\n1 (a)(4), a location is specified and all of the\n\n2 statutes and rules that we cite in our brief, a\n\n3 location is specified.\n\n4 And so, if there is not a location,\n\nthat does not connote ambiguity. It connotes\n\n6 breadth. And the embassy is, in the words of\n\n7 Justice Kagan, something special. It is the\n\n8 extension of the foreign ministry in the United\n\n9 States. And so it is quite a modest step to\n\nsay that that is an address at which service of\n\n11 process to the foreign minister is proper.\n\n12 Now, on the issue of policy, I think\n\n13 that the best response to your concern about\n\n14 policy -- and I acknowledge that there was a\n\ndefault judgment in this case, though no one","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"40","file_name":"Republic of Sudan v.

SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that\u0027s a\n\nquestion for Mr. Curran, but we would certainly\n\n11 have to start over in this case. And I think\n\n12 that the reason why that is particularly\n\n13 inequitable here is because, in this case, we\n\n14 would essentially be held to have failed to\n\nserve properly by failing to comply with a\n\n16 requirement that does not appear on the face of\n\n17 the statute and in a context in which Sudan\n\n18 unquestionably had actual notice of the\n\n19 litigation.\n\nAnd, again, as this case comes to the\n\n21 Court, it comes to the Court on the assumption\n\n22 that Sudan accepted service here,\n\n23 notwithstanding Sudan\u0027s late effort to cast\n\n24 doubt on that proposition.

We\u0027re talking about an objection\n\n6 that was raised in the very -- at the very last\n\n7 minute in response to turnover orders.
