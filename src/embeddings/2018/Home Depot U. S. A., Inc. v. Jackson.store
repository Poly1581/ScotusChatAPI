We\u0027re\n\njust a defendant.\n\nHome Depot is not a counterclaim\n\ndefendant. We didn\u0027t sue anyone in this case.\n\nHome Depot is not a third-party defendant.\n\nWe\u0027re not being sued for indemnity or\n\ncontribution.\n\nHome Depot is simply a defendant, the\n\noriginal defendant, to a consumer fraud class\n\naction filed in state court by Mr. Jackson.

As the Court is aware,\n\nShamrock Oil is an original plaintiff case, not\n\nan original defendant case. The lower courts\n\nhave erred in extending the holding of Shamrock\n\nOil to say that, basically, you have to be an\n\noriginal defendant to be able to remove.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Home Depot U.
