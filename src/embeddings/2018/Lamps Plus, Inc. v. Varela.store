As I understand it, the -- the\n\nargument is that applying these principles has\n\n21 a peculiar impact on arbitration agreements\n\n22 since it authorizes a type of arbitration that\n\n23 is -- is like a poison pill that basically said\n\n24 in prior cases is fundamentally inconsistent\n\nwith arbitration.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\n1 MS.
