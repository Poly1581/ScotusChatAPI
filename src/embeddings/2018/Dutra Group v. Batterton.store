WAXMAN: Well, the -- there are\n\nsome differences, as Justice Sotomayor -- there\n\nwere reasons why the court, when it enacted the\n\nJones Act, didn\u0027t preempt other federal --\n\nexisting federal common law remedies.\n\nAnd the situation of preemption and\n\nthe effect of a statutory scheme of remedies\n\nvis-a-vis preexisting common law is markedly\n\ndifferent when the common law is federal rather\n\nthan state. But, for example, even to this\n\nday, the defendant in a Jones Act case and the\n\ndefendant in an unseaworthiness case may be\n\ndifferent.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"7","file_name":"Dutra Group v.

Like, what are\n\nthe remedies that you get for wrongful death?\n\nAnd what this Court held was that the\n\nremedies you get for wrongful death include the\n\nloss of society.\n\nThe next case that comes along is\n\nMobil Oil versus Higginbotham, raises wrongful\n\ndeath for unseaworthiness but for a wrongful\n\ndeath that occurred on the high seas.\n\nAnd this time what this Court says is,\n\nwell, the Death on the High Seas Act doesn\u0027t --\n\nonly allows for recovery of pecuniary damages.\n\nLoss of society is not pecuniary damages. So\n\nwe need to constrict the federal common law\n\nremedies that we recognized in Gaudet in cases\n\nthat occur on the high seas.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n13\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"10","file_name":"Dutra Group v.

It\u0027s reflected in -- in one of the\n\nprincipal cases that my friend is relying on as\n\nan example of punitive damages in\n\nunseaworthiness cases.\n\nIt\u0027s a case called the Noddleburn.\n\nIt\u0027s also, I believe -- yeah.\n\nThe Noddleburn was a case in which it\n\nwas brought for unseaworthiness and for\n\nmaintenance and cure. The court held with\n\nrespect to unseaworthiness that \"there was\n\nactual knowledge of the unsound and unseaworthy\n\ncondition of the vessel, coupled not only with\n\nwillful negligence but wanton indifference.\"\n\nAnd yet, in the Noddleburn, the court\n\nconsidered and discussed the possibility of\n\nawarding punitive damages for the failure to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n17\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nprovide maintenance and cure but not for\n\nunseaworthiness.\n\nNow I can\u0027t cite you a case either\n\nbefore the Jones Act was passed or after, for\n\ndecades and decades after, in which a court\n\nsaid we\u0027ve been asked to apply punitive damages\n\nbecause the -- the conduct that constituted\n\nunseaworthiness was egregious.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"14","file_name":"Dutra Group v.

I\u0027m happy to do that because,\n\nnotwithstanding all the rhetoric, there is no\n\ncitation of any situation where a particular\n\nholding created the kind of economic harm that\n\nthey expostulate.\n\nAnd this is an important thing, as was\n\npointed out, that for decades, punitive damages\n\nhave been allowed in unseaworthiness claims in\n\nthe Ninth Circuit, in the Eleventh Circuit,\n\nboth two of the major maritime circuits, and if\n\nthat harm were to come to pass, you would have\n\nexpected to see some evidence of that.\n\nBut, in fact, there\u0027s no evidence of\n\nthat. And I accept that many of the employers\n\non the other side would rather not face the\n\nspecter of having their own willful and wanton\n\nmisconduct punished.\n\nBut I would submit that part of the\n\nobjective of the law is to deter people from\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n51\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"45","file_name":"Dutra Group v.
