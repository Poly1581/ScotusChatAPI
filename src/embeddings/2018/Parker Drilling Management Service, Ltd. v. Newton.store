Justice Kagan, you were talking and\n\nasking about the standards. And there are two\n\nof them.\n\nOne of them is called James Stewart,\n\nand the other is called Paul. In the James\n\nStewart case, what this Court did was it took a\n\npersonal injury that occurred in a federal\n\nenclave in New York, where, because there were\n\nno -- because there -- it adopted the general\n\nenclave principles, it incorporated state\n\nstandards with respect to what steel beams\n\nneeded to be used in construction.\n\nThere, the worker was injured because\n\nof a violation of the state standard. And what\n\nthis Court held was that that state standard\n\nhad been incorporated into the federal enclave\n\nlaw and, therefore, was the law of the United\n\nStates, I think was the phrase this Court used.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"38","file_name":"Parker Drilling Management Service, Ltd. v.
