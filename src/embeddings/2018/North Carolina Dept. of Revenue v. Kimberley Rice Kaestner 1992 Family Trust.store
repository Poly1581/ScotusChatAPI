O\u0027NEIL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. O\u0027NEIL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nI\u0027d actually like to begin where\n\nJustice Ginsburg began because I think it\n\nhighlights one of the key features and critical\n\naspects of this case that the state\u0027s position\n\nignores and that dictates the outcome.\n\nThe first point is this was not really\n\nthe beneficiary\u0027s money during the tax years.\n\nShe didn\u0027t possess it or control it. She\n\ndidn\u0027t access it. She couldn\u0027t use it. She\n\ncouldn\u0027t buy anything with it, promise it to\n\nsomeone else. She couldn\u0027t have any say in how\n\nit was invested.\n\nShe didn\u0027t receive any of it, and she\n\nhad no guarantee that she would ever receive a\n\npenny of it in North Carolina or anywhere else.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Was it the trustee\u0027s\n\nmoney?\n\nMR.
