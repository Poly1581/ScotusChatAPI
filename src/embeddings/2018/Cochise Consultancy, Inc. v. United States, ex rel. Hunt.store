In this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Graham, interpreting the\n\nFalse Claims Act, it held that these provisions\n\nmust be interpreted in context, not in\n\nisolation. And, in particular, it -- it\n\nfocused on the language under -- under Section\n\n3730, which is contained in Section 3731(b)(2).\n\nAnd, here, the statutory context confirms that\n\nthat language, \"action under Section 3730,\" as\n\nincorporated into subsection (b)(2), is limited\n\nto those actions where the United States is a\n\nparty, either because it\u0027s intervened or it\n\nfiled a complaint.\n\nAnd Graham said --\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn\u0027t the United\n\nStates in some sense a party even if it hasn\u0027t\n\nintervened? After all, it\u0027s going to get the\n\nlion\u0027s share of the recovery, and, if I\n\nunderstand correctly, it -- the suit can\u0027t be\n\ndismissed without notice and -- and approval by\n\nthe United States.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"3","file_name":"Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v.

And -- and the -- the key here, Your\n\nHonor, is, if we look at the text of the\n\nstatute, it -- there are multiple textual cues.\n\nThe first are that the provision,\n\nSection 3731(b)(2), only refers to the United\n\nStates. And the statute refers to relators and\n\nthe United States separately throughout. But\n\nit only refers to the United States.\n\nAnd as Judge Wilkinson in the Sanders\n\ncase from the Fourth Circuit noted, it makes no\n\nsense to apply this tolling provision to a\n\nrelator where the United States is not\n\ninvolved. The language is that the knowledge\n\nof the official of the United States charged\n\nwith responsibility to act in the circumstances\n\ntriggers the statute of limitations.\n\nSo knowledge of a third party that\u0027s\n\nnot a party to the case would somehow put the\n\nplaintiff who\u0027s -- who\u0027s the -- the relator,\n\nwho\u0027s not an injured party, on notice that\n\nthere\u0027s a claim, it could start the clock\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"4","file_name":"Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v.

BOUTROUS: Well, actually, Your\n\nHonor, in Graham, that exact issue was\n\npresented. The Court said, in discussing\n\nSection 3731(d), which at the time was\n\nsubsection (c), that the language \"action\n\nbrought under Section 3730\" meant only actions\n\nbrought under the United States in that\n\nprovision.\n\nAnd the Court said it was the --\n\nbasically the exact same language in Section\n\n3731(b)(1), which is what the Court was talking\n\nabout. The Court said that Congress spoke\n\nimprecisely, used the term \"actions under\n\nSection 3730\" imprecisely, and it sometimes\n\nused that phrase to refer to only a subset of\n\nactions under Section 3730.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"6","file_name":"Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v.

In our view, the correct\n\ninterpretation of the statute mandates that the\n\nrelator and the United States always have the\n\nsame deadlines for filing suit.\n\nThe six-year limitations period in\n\n(b)(1) and the three-year tolling rule in\n\n(b)(2) will expire on precisely the same date\n\nfor both a potential relator and for the United\n\nStates.\n\nSo, under the correct interpretation\n\nof the statute, a relator could never bring a\n\ntimely action, unless the United States could\n\nalso bring an action on the same day alleging\n\nthe same fraud.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"49","file_name":"Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v.

And in this\n\ncase, the federal government doesn\u0027t know of\n\nthe fraud. Instead, the relator knows of the\n\nfraud on day one. And assuming that the\n\ngovernment remains in blissful ignorance, and\n\neverybody else does too, he gets ten years.\n\nIsn\u0027t that right?\n\nMR. GUARNIERI: That\u0027s correct. We\n\nthink that that\u0027s how the the statute would\n\noperate.\n\nNow the relator in that sense would\n\nalso have more of the six-year period to bring\n\nthe suit. If the relator learns of the fraud\n\non day one, the relator will have more of those\n\nsix years in which to file suit than the United\n\nStates will have. And we think that\u0027s of no\n\nconsequence.\n\nIt\u0027s -- Congress adopted a different\n\nform of parallel treatment, and the form of\n\nparallel treatment that Congress adopted\n\nensures that the -- the deadlines expire for\n\nboth the United States and the relator at\n\nexactly the same point in time.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"51","file_name":"Cochise Consultancy, Inc. v.
