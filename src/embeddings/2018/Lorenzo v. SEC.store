The court below\n\ncorrectly held that Petitioner, Frank Lorenzo,\n\nwas not the maker of the statements that are at\n\nissue in the two emails in this case.\n\nHowever, the court below erred when it\n\nheld that Lorenzo could nevertheless be liable\n\nfor those very same misstatements under a\n\ntheory that, by producing and sending those\n\nstatements, he engaged in a deceptive act,\n\nartifice to defraud, or practice, for purposes\n\nof liability under Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5(a)\n\nand (c) and Section 17(a)(1).\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nFor three reasons Lorenzo\u0027s actions do\n\nnot support liability.\n\nFirst, permitting liability under Rule\n\n10b-5(a) and (c) and 17(a) would allow\n\nplaintiffs to sidestep this Court\u0027s holding in\n\nJanus and the limitations that were placed on\n\nmisstatement liability. And it would allow\n\nplaintiffs to creatively relabel their\n\ninadequate misstatement claims as claims for\n\ndeceptive devices and acts.\n\nThe result is contrary to Janus and\n\nwould render Rule 10b-5(b) a nullity.\n\nSecond -­\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, Janus\n\nwas a private cause of action, correct?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Lorenzo v.

about 10b-5(b). I think it was\n\nthe second question in the oral argument in\n\nthat case from Justice Sotomayor was why isn\u0027t\n\nthere an (a) claim, a scheme claim in this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n38\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncase? And petitioner\u0027s response was not that\n\nhis clients wouldn\u0027t have been liable under\n\nthat theory. It was that that simply hadn\u0027t\n\narisen in the case.\n\nSo Janus was clearly just deciding the\n\nmeaning of (b), which I do think goes to the\n\nreal flaw in Petitioner\u0027s argument, which is,\n\nagain, that subsection (b) somehow restricts\n\nthe meaning of (a) and (c) in Rule 10b-5 and\n\nalso somehow restricts the meaning of\n\nsubsection (a) of a completely different\n\nstatute, the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nAnd I do think it\u0027s a quite\n\nextraordinary argument to say that the\n\nCommission could, by adopting a rule in 1942,\n\nchange the meaning of a statute that was\n\nenacted by the Congress and signed by the\n\nPresident in 1933.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"36","file_name":"Lorenzo v.

Commission.\n\nFirst of all, of course, it\u0027s not available at\n\nall in a private right of action, which is one\n\nof the principal ways in which victims of fraud\n\ncan recover money.\n\nBut it\u0027s also not available even in a\n\nCommission action unless there\u0027s a primary\n\nviolation. You have to find the primary\n\nviolator.

And as\n\nI said earlier, the Affiliated Ute case, I\n\nthink, is -- is squarely on point and says\n\nsomebody can be liable under (a) and (c) even\n\nif they\u0027re not liable under (b).\n\nJustice Alito\u0027s opinion, which we\n\ncited at page 36 of our brief, in the Lee case\n\nfrom the Third Circuit, I think is helpful on\n\nthis point too. In that case, there was a\n\nstatute that covered both crimes of deceit on\n\nthe one hand and tax evasion on the other hand.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd Justice Alito\u0027s opinion explained\n\nthat a tax crime that was not evasion but still\n\ninvolved deceit would be covered by that\n\nstatute because the enumeration of tax evasion\n\ndidn\u0027t preempt the field or didn\u0027t serve as the\n\nexclusive vehicle for all tax-related claims.\n\nAnd I think the same analysis applies here.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"52","file_name":"Lorenzo v.
