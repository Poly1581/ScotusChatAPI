Congress was\n\n9 thinking about habitat in the sense that it is\n\nused in -- in common speech and in the\n\n11 dictionaries, which is a \"can be occupied\"\n\n12 sense. Let me give you an example: The 1979\n\n13 Convention of -- on Migratory Species, to which\n\n14 we are a signatory, says it\u0027s an area which\n\ncontains suitable living conditions.\n\n16 The Forest Service, contemporaneously\n\n17 with these amendments in 1978, said that it\u0027s\n\n18 the environment where all the essentials for a\n\n19 species\u0027 development and existence are present.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you use the\n\n21 migratory bird example, then we have here the\n\n22 ephemeral ponds, which are supposed -- supposed\n\n23 to be ideal for breeding, so it\u0027s -- it\u0027s a\n\n24 habitat that is suitable for breeding.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"6","file_name":"Weyerhaeuser Co. v.
