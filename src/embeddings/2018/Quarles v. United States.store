Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\n11 For centuries, the essence of burglary\n\n12 has been punishing those who trespass for the\n\n13 purpose of committing a crime. That was the\n\n14 rule at common law. It remained the majority\n\nview at the time of ACCA and Taylor. For two\n\n16 main reasons, the Court should confirm that\n\n17 generic burglary retains that traditional\n\n18 requirement of contemporaneous intent, intent\n\n19 at the time of the initial trespass.\n\nFirst, the sources that matter under\n\n21 Taylor show that \"remaining in\" was understood\n\n22 as a modest expansion of the traditional\n\n23 offense to cover those who entered lawfully,\n\n24 but then overstay their welcome to commit a\n\ncrime.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n4\n\n1 But the government reads Taylor\u0027s use\n\n2 of that one word, \"remaining in\", as a sharp\n\n3 break from that tradition. Under that view,\n\n4 \"remaining\" would cover anyone who enters\n\nunlawfully, regardless of whether they had that\n\n6 burglarious intent at the time of entry as long\n\n7 as the intent was formed later. And nothing in\n\n8 Taylor or the sources that existed at the time\n\n9 of ACCA suggest an intention or acknowledgment\n\nof making such a dramatic change.\n\n11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, something --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Quarles v.
