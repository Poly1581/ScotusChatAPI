of Copyrights must make a registration\n\ndetermination before an applicant can sue for\n\ninfringement.\n\nAnd I\u0027d like to start with the\n\noperative sentence of Section 411(a). This is\n\non page 30a of the petition appendix.

It says registration has\n\nbeen refused. That obviously is talking about\n\nthe final act of registration. That\u0027s the only\n\n-- that\u0027s what has been refused in that -- in\n\nthat scenario.\n\nSo it\u0027s pretty strange to think that\n\n\"registration,\" that word in the first\n\nsentence, doesn\u0027t mean the same thing and the\n\nonly person who can make registration in that\n\nsense is the Register of Copyrights.\n\nThe second thing to notice is that the\n\nsecond sentence says that when you -- refers to\n\ndelivering to the Copyright Office your\n\ndeposit, application, and fee in proper form.\n\nYou might recognize that sentence. That\u0027s what\n\nmy friend says \"registration has been made\"\n\nmeans in the first. Again, pretty peculiar for\n\nCongress to refer to the exact same conduct in\n\ntwo consecutive sentences and not use a phrase\n\nthat even resembles each other.\n\nAnd the third thing is what my friend\n\nsays -- has already raised, that the whole\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n53\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npoint of the second sentence is to create an\n\nexception to the registration requirement in\n\nthe first.

you don\u0027t need an exception to\n\nthe registration requirement when the Register\n\nhas refused registration.\n\nIf all you had to do\n\nwas submit your application in proper form,\n\nwhat the
