 Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nRule 32.2(b) states in unequivocal\n\nterms that a -- a district court must enter a\n\npreliminary order of forfeiture prior to\n\nsentencing.  In this case, no one disputes no\n\nsuch order was entered, and there\u0027s also no\n\ndispute why not, as the Second Circuit found,\n\nbecause the government did not submit one.\n\nIndeed, none was entered until three years after\n\nsentencing.\n\nPetitioner contends that Rule 32.2(b)\n\nis a mandatory claims-processing rule and the\n\nfailure to enter the preliminary order of\n\nforfeiture is fatal to the government\u0027s ability\n\nto seek forfeiture.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nSuch a reading is consistent with the\n\nplain language of the rule, its structure and\n\npurpose.  The plain language requires entry of a\n\npreliminary order prior to sentencing.  This\n\nCourt has never interpreted the term \"must\" to\n\nmean a mere time-related directive.\n\nSuch an interpretation is also\n\nconsistent with the rule\u0027s comprehensive\n\nstructure pursuant to which forfeiture must be\n\naddressed.  Those directives start from the\n\nbeginning of the case, continue through verdict,\n\nthen prior to sentencing, at sentencing, and\n\nafter sentencing.  This highly calibrated\n\nstructure confirms the mandatory nature of the\n\nneed to enter the preliminary order of\n\nforfeiture.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"McIntosh v.

YUROWITZ:  So -- I -- I\u0027d just\n\nlike to go back to Justice Gorsuch\u0027s question\n\nabout harmless error.  The reason why there\u0027s no\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\nharmless error analysis is because this Court\n\nhas never really applied harm -- harmless error\n\nin the context of either a mandatory\n\nclaim-processing rule or -- or time-related\n\ndirectives.\n\nIndeed, in Dolan, Chief Justice --\n\nJustice Roberts pointed out that it\u0027s a rule\n\nwith no consequence because the majority said,\n\neven in unlikely instances where the delay does\n\ncause the defendant prejudice, the defendant\n\nremains free to ask the court to take that\n\naccount.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"45","file_name":"McIntosh v.
