If there\u0027s a difficulty in\n\nclassifying broadband today, the difficulty is\n\nthat the statute was last passed in 1996, so\n\nfiguring out whether 2023 broadband is a 1996\n\ninformation service or a 1996 telecommunication\n\nservice is a granddaddy of a problem, but it\n\ndoes have a binary answer.  It\u0027s one or the\n\nother.\n\nNow, bringing it home to this statute,\n\nwhat I would say is, if you do the Chevron\n\nambiguity test, you find a word like\n\n\"appropriate\" in the statute or maybe for some\n\npeople \"carry,\" though I think that one\u0027s pretty\n\nclear, and you say that word is ambiguous, so\n\nI\u0027m going to go to step two.

a test of Article III:  Will courts continue\n\nto say what the law is?\n\nBut I think, stepping back, I want to\n\nmake sure that what doesn\u0027t get lost in the\n\nshuffle is that Petitioners have made an\n\nimportant concession that I think illustrates\n\nthat the issue here is actually far narrower and\n\nthat their attacks on Chevron lack merit and are\n\nunnecessary.\n\nThe concession is this:  Petitioners\n\nacknowledge that Congress can expressly delegate\n\nto agencies the authority to define statutory\n\nterms and fill gaps.  Imagine, for example, if\n\nthe statute said, in Chevron, \"stationary\n\nsource\" as defined by the Administrator.  I take\n\nboth Petitioners to give that up and recognize\n\nthat is a delegation and courts should respect\n\nthat.\n\nThe role of the court in that\n\ncircumstance is to make sure that the agency has\n\nfollowed the proper procedures and stayed what\n\n-- within whatever outer bounds Congress itself\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\nhas set. And all of that complies with the\n\nConstitution, of course, because Congress has\n\nArticle I authority to delegate gap-filling\n\nauthority to agencies, and the executive has\n\ncore Article II authority to fill in those gaps.\n\nThat\u0027s a core exercise of the executive power.\n\nAnd then the Article III courts are just\n\nfulfilling their judicial role when they give\n\neffect to what Congress has done in its choice\n\nto rely on the agency in that regard.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"43","file_name":"Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc. v.

So my theory\n\nfor why Chevron didn\u0027t address 706 is because\n\n706 has never been understood at any time, at\n\nthe time it was enacted or in any of the eight\n\ndecades since, to have dictated a de novo\n\nstandard of review for all statutory\n\ninterpretation questions.\n\nSo there was no inherent tension\n\nbetween Section 706 and Chevron.

I was trying to explain in the\n\nfirst argument, you know, this is a situation\n\nwhere the Court has recognized that the APA\n\nwasn\u0027t meant to create dramatic changes, and it\n\nwould have been a dramatic change, going from\n\nall of the deference principles that had been\n\ndeployed, particularly in cases of ambiguity in\n\nthe case law, including immediately leading up\n\nto the APA,

So my\n\nunderstanding is about half the states still\n\nhave something akin to a principle of deference.\n\nThere might be some variance with respect to how\n\nmuch it looks like Chevron.  But I acknowledge\n\nthat some states have abolished any form of\n\ndeference to administrative agencies.\n\nI do think that there is a lot less\n\nconcern at the state level about the lack of\n\nuniformity or consistency, so one of the values\n\nthat Chevron implements and recognizes for why\n\nCongress would prefer for an agency to be able\n\nto set these rules and for the courts to respect\n\nthat is the value in ensuring that there are\n\nuniform rules throughout the country.

four\n\ncritical things, which draw heavily on Kisor but\n\nI think look a little different in their\n\nparticulars.\n\nThe first thing the Court could do\n\nwould be to reemphasize the rigor of the step\n\none analysis.  Now this is drawn directly from\n\nKisor. As I mentioned before, we\u0027ve seen\n\nresults in the lower courts where they are now\n\nfollowing this Court\u0027s direction with respect to\n\nthat.\n\nSo, in this regard, what the Court\n\nwould be saying is don\u0027t wave the ambiguity flag\n\ntoo readily.

But that is not actually the\n\nstandard.\n\nEven at that step two stage, it\u0027s\n\nobviously deferential, but the Court should be\n\nenforcing any outer bounds in the statute and\n\nmaking sure that the agency hasn\u0027t transgressed\n\nthose.\n\nI think the third thing the Court\n\ncould do is emphasize that this whole enterprise\n\nonly gets off the ground in a me-type situation\n\nwhere you have the agency being directly\n\nempowered by Congress to speak with the force of\n\nlaw and then exercising appropriately a formal\n\nlevel of authority in implementing the statute.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n83\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd so I think that that is an\n\nimportant principle as well, that there are\n\ncertain contexts in which the agency is not\n\nactually speaking with the force of law or in a\n\nway that would be fitting with the delegation\n\nCongress has provided.\n\nAnd then, finally, the fourth thing\n\nthat the Court could do, and I think this is a\n\nlittle bit different from Kisor, would be to\n\nemphasize that it\u0027s always important to look at\n\nany other statutory indication that Chevron","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"74","file_name":"Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc. v.

It doesn\u0027t do what Chevron\n\npurports to do, which is to delegate\n\ninterpretive authority.\n\nBut, better yet, once you have text,\n\nyou can put limits on the text.  And Michigan\n\nagainst EPA is a perfect example of that. And,\n\nof course, all of these delegations do raise\n\nArticle I non-delegation concerns. And if you\n\nhave text, you can check for that as well. But\n\nI can\u0027t think of anything that\u0027s more\n\nantithetical to an intelligible principle than\n\nambiguity and silence.\n\nAnd I will say in terms of the -- the\n\n-- you know, this premise, I think it\u0027s entirely\n\nfictional. I think in most cases a statute is\n\nambiguous because the proponent did not have\n\nenough votes to make it any clearer.\n\nMy friend at one point said that I\n\nview the whole world as every statute has a\n\nbinary answer.
