COLE\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nGovernment officials are free to urge\n\npeople not to support political groups they\n\noppose.  What they cannot do is use their\n\nregulatory might to add \"or else\" to that\n\nrequest.\n\nRespondent Vullo did just that.  Not\n\ncontent to rely on the force of her ideas, she\n\nabused the coercive power of her office.  In\n\nFebruary 2018, she told Lloyd\u0027s, the insurance\n\nunderwriter, that she\u0027d go easy on its unrelated\n\ninsurance violations if it aided her campaign to\n\nweaken the NRA by halting all business with the\n\ngroup. Lloyd\u0027s agreed.\n\nSix weeks later, she issued guidance\n\nletters and a press release directing the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nthousands of banks and insurance companies that\n\nshe directly oversees to cut off their ties with\n\nthe NRA not because of any alleged illegality\n\nbut because they promote guns.\n\nIn the accompanying press release,\n\nVullo\u0027s boss and co-defendant, Governor Andrew\n\nCuomo, said he directed Vullo to issue the\n\nguidance because doing business with the NRA\n\n\"sends the wrong message.\"  Shortly thereafter,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"NRA v.
