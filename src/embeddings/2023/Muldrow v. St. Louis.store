I -- I\u0027ll -- I\u0027ll end with this,\n\nwhich is that the Fifth Circuit in its recent\n\nen banc decision, 14 members of the court said\n\nthese doctrines are thwarting legitimate claims\n\nof workplace bias.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nJackson?\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I\u0027m\n\nreally confused and a little bit worried about\n\nyour concession to Justice Kagan that there is\n\nsome sort of injury requirement here.  I -- I\n\nlook at the text of the statute, and it seems to\n\nbe doing what you said at the end with respect\n\nto Justice Barrett, which is identifying when\n\nthere are unlawful employment practices.\n\nSo the statute begins, \"It shall be an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n38\n\nOfficial\n\nunlawful employment practice for an employer,\"\n\nand then we skip down, \"to discriminate against\n\nany individual with respect to the terms and\n\nconditions,\" et cetera, of its employment\n\nbecause of these protected characteristics.\n\nSo, to the extent that we are\n\nidentifying sort of what is morally\n\nreprehensible, what is unlawful, I suppose we\u0027re\n\njust saying when someone discriminates with\n\nrespect to these terms and conditions.\n\nSo then the question, I guess, is what\n\ndoes it mean to discriminate, and I don\u0027t know\n\nthat that necessarily means that there has to be\n\nsome sort of injury.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"33","file_name":"Muldrow v.

I agree\n\nwith what the District of Columbia\u0027s brief said,\n\nthat that phrasing has helped the -- the lower\n\ncourts, the district courts, there have\n\nsufficient leeway to continue to dismiss claims\n\nthat are not actionable, that maintains the kind\n\nof, you know --\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.
