TAYLOR\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. TAYLOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSection 25b preempts a state consumer\n\nfinancial law only if, as relevant here, \"it\n\nprevents or significantly interferes with\" the\n\nexercise of a national bank\u0027s powers.  Bank of\n\nAmerica argues and the Second Circuit held that\n\nthis statute preempts any law that controls or\n\notherwise hinders the exercise of a national\n\nbank\u0027s powers, regardless of whether the law has\n\nany significant effect on such powers.\n\nThis test conflicts with the statute\n\nfor four reasons.  First, Section 25b\u0027s\n\ndefinition of \"state consumer financial law\" is\n\nincompatible with the control test because it\n\nwould require that every such law be preempted,\n\nnullifying the statute and erecting the very\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nfield preemption regime that the statute","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Cantero v.

Bank of America\u0027s only retort is to\n\nconcede that state fair lending laws aren\u0027t\n\ncategorically preempted, a concession it doesn\u0027t\n\nexplain and that disproves its own test.\n\nSecond, the control test ignores\n\nSection 25b\u0027s express codification of Barnett\n\nBank\u0027s \"prevents or significantly interferes\n\nwith\" standard and, in particular, the word\n\n\"significantly,\" which Bank of America reads out\n\nof the statute.\n\nThird, a control test can\u0027t be squared\n\nwith Section 25b\u0027s provisions for OCC preemption\n\ndeterminations, which must assess the impact of\n\na state law and be based on substantial\n\nevidence.  These requirements would make no\n\nsense if a control test were the law.\n\nFinally and perhaps most\n\nfundamentally, adopting a control test would\n\nrequire reading virtually all of Section 25b to\n\nhave no real-world effect.\n\nWith no plausible textual argument,\n\nBank of America turns to policy, claiming that\n\nits test is needed to avoid mayhem.

factual\n\nrecord for banking preemption.\n\nNow, on the OCC, I think, you know,\n\nthere are three reasons why it is just simply\n\nimplausible that by codifying Barnett Bank,\n\nCongress tended to overrule it or somehow upset\n\nit. And the first is what I already mentioned,\n\nthe 30 words of text that says you need to\n\nfollow Barnett Bank.\n\nAnd the second is there is a specific\n\nprovision in 25b(c), we rely on it, the OCC\n\nrelies on it, that says OCC must follow the\n\nlegal standard of Barnett Bank, without any\n\nreference to the \"prevents or significantly\n\ninterferes.\"  So they can\u0027t possibly mean two\n\nseparate things.

And this Court made that up as an\n\nadministrable line.  And if it\u0027s comfortable\n\nwith that as the line when it\u0027s not in the\n\nstatute, then it should be comfortable with that\n\nas the line when it is in the statute.\n\nNow there was a cluster of questions\n\nabout the practical effect, and I just would say\n\nthree things.  The first is the importance of a\n\nnon-discriminatory law. It\u0027s why a lot of their\n\nlaws are hypos and not reality, Justice Kagan.\n\nBut, Justice Alito, that doesn\u0027t mean\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n125\n\nOfficial\n\nthat that is the entire test, just like it would\n\nhave been under the Treasury Department.  You\n\nstill have laws that conflict, as in Barnett\n\nBank, and you still have laws that -- where\n\nthere\u0027s a real significant interference.\n\nJustice Kagan, you gave a hypo where a\n\nbank couldn\u0027t make a loan unless a person could\n\ntalk to the president of the bank. If that\u0027s\n\nnon-discriminatory, it sounds a lot like\n\nsignificant interference to me.\n\nAnd there\u0027s -- the third point I would\n\nmake is there\u0027s still a role for the OCC to play\n\nhere.

It was a reacting\n\nagainst what the OCC had done. The OCC said the\n\nsame 2004 rule remains in effect and the same\n\nlist of laws are preempted.
