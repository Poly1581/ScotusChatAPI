BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nSTEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe living-individual clause of 15\n\nU.S.C. 1052(c) is consistent with the First\n\nAmendment.  To begin, I\u0027d like to emphasize\n\nthree points.\n\nFirst, Section 1052(c) imposes a\n\ncondition on a federal benefit, not a\n\nrestriction on speech.  Even if Mr. Elster\n\ncannot register the mark TRUMP TOO SMALL, he can\n\nsell shirts with that slogan.  He can also\n\nobtain the benefits of federal trademark\n\nregistration for those shirts by choosing a\n\ndifferent source identifier.  The\n\nliving-individual clause simply restricts\n\nMr. Elster\u0027s ability to assert exclusive rights\n\nin another person\u0027s name.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nSecond, Section 1052(c) is viewpoint\n\nneutral.  To apply it to any particular\n\ntrademark, the PTO simply asks whether the mark\n\nrefers to an identified individual and whether\n\nthat individual has consented to registration.\n\nThe agency need not and does not consider\n\nwhether the mark is flattering, critical, or\n\nneutral with respect to the named individual.\n\nMr. Elster\u0027s speculation about the circumstances\n\nunder which identified individuals will or will\n\nnot consent to registration cannot justify\n\ntreating the provision as viewpoint\n\ndiscriminatory.\n\nThird, the fact that Mr. Elster\u0027s mark","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Vidal, Under Sec. of Comm. v.

The Court\n\nhas described copyright as the engine of free\n\nexpression. Its whole purpose is to promote\n\nincentives for creative expressive endeavors.\n\nTrademark has a very different purpose.\n\nAnd to -- to -- to point to one\n\ninstance in which -- though, in which it\u0027s\n\nimportant to recognize that copyright\n\nregistration is a government benefit, one of the\n\nrequirements you have to satisfy in order to\n\nregister your copyright is you need to pay a fee\n\nto the Copyright Office, and, obviously, that\n\nwould raise huge First Amendment problems if it\n\nwas a condition on engaging in the speech.\n\nThe reason we don\u0027t think of it as\n\nproblematic in the copyright registration\n\nprogram is that it\u0027s not a condition on the\n\nspeech; it\u0027s a condition on the benefits that go\n\nwith federal copyright registration.\n\nSo the analysis would have to take\n\ninto account the fact that it\u0027s a benefit\n\nprogram, but if the question is can Congress\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial\n\nexclude certain types of creative works from\n\ncopyright protection based on their content,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"4","file_name":"Vidal, Under Sec. of Comm. v.

government\u0027s defense of the names\n\nclause, as the discussion so far this morning\n\nshows, begins and ends with its argument that\n\nthe clause should be subjected only to rational\n\nbasis review, not any form of First Amendment\n\nscrutiny.\n\nThat is incorrect. For three reasons,\n\nthe clause should be subjected to heightened\n\nscrutiny.  First, the clause withholds valuable\n\nlegal protections generally available to all\n\ntrademark holders who pay the fee, including\n\npresumptive validity, protection against certain\n\ndefenses, and incontestability, and it does so\n\nbased solely on the applicant\u0027s speech.  That\n\nselective content-based withholding of generally\n\navailable legal protections is a substantial\n\nburden on speech.\n\nSecond, the names clause leverages the\n\nregistration system and its attendant rights and\n\nbenefits to achieve a purpose wholly unrelated\n\nto the purposes of trademark law, unlike the\n\nseparate prohibitions on false association and\n\nmarks likely to confuse or mislead, both of\n\nwhich are tightly connected to the purposes of\n\ntrademark law and trademark registration.
