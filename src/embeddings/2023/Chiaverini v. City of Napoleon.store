So it\u0027s sort of like the\n\nsame idea that the Sixth Circuit was latching\n\nonto because it -- there are cases that say\n\nthat, but it seems like they\u0027re in a different\n\ncontext.

important for the Court\n\nto take one step further and to say that the\n\nplaintiff bears the burden of proving that the\n\nbaseless charge caused an unreasonable seizure.\n\nThat\u0027s an important step to take\n\nbecause, if there\u0027s no unreasonable seizure,\n\nthere\u0027s no violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nBut it\u0027s also not a significant step to take\n\nbecause you\u0027d just be reaffirming what you\u0027ve\n\nalready said in Thompson.\n\nNow I understand Respondents to ask\n\nthe Court to take one step further still and to\n\ndetermine that the seizure in this

WOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nWhen a plaintiff brings a Section 1983\n\nmalicious prosecution claim under the Fourth\n\nAmendment, the plaintiff must show that the\n\nalleged malicious prosecution resulted in the\n\nplaintiff\u0027s seizure, as this Court held in\n\nThompson.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit correctly concluded\n\nthat Petitioner cannot make that showing because\n\nprobable cause supported his detention.\n\nPetitioner was arrested and detained for three\n\ndays pursuant to a warrant supported by probable\n\ncause for two first degree misdemeanor crimes,\n\neach carrying a sentence up to six months\u0027\n\nimprisonment.\n\nIn light of that, the presence of a\n\nthird charge, allegedly lacking probable cause,\n\ncould not have resulted in Petitioner\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\ndetention.  This result flows directly from\n\nexisting Fourth Amendment precedents, including\n\nDevenpeck versus Alford and Whren versus United\n\nStates, which make clear that a seizure does not\n\nviolate the Fourth Amendment \"as long as [the]\n\ncircumstances, viewed objectively, justify that\n\naction.\"","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"42","file_name":"Chiaverini v.

prosecution must have resulted in a\n\nseizure, which, as the United States points out,\n\nis perfectly consistent with our preferred\n\nEleventh Circuit formulation, and don\u0027t touch\n\nthe question of the warrant clause.\n\nWe raised the warrant clause to talk\n\nabout the values and purposes of the Fourth\n\nAmendment only, not to suggest that there is\n\nnecessarily a 1983 claim predicated on it or\n\nwhat constitutional tort applies.\n\nAs for Respondents\u0027 position, I\u0027ll\n\njust note that what they\u0027re now describing as a\n\nstrawman is precisely what they argued for\n\nbelow. Here\u0027s a quote from oral argument:  \"So\n\nlong as probable cause exists to one of multiple\n\ncriminal charges, that is enough to negate the\n\nentire malicious prosecution claim.\"\n\nThis Court can do a lot of good by\n\njust resolving the question presented and saying\n\nthat the -- the any-crime rule -- as Justice\n\nGorsuch said, you can always come up with some\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n70\n\nOfficial\n\ncrime for which there\u0027s probable cause.
