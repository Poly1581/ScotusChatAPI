Thank you.\n\nMr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nLess than two years ago, in Southwest\n\nversus Saxon, this Court carefully examined the\n\ntext and history of the Federal Arbitration\n\nAct\u0027s worker exemption, and it held that the\n\nexemption applies to \"any class of workers\n\ndirectly involved in transporting goods across\n\nstate or international borders.\"\n\nFlowers now asks this Court to add an\n\nadditional unwritten requirement that the\n\nworker\u0027s employer must sell transportation.\n\nAccording to Flowers, if the thousands of truck\n\ndrivers who work full-time hauling its goods\n\nwere only implied -- employed by a trucking\n\ncompany that Flowers had hired to do so, then\n\nthey\u0027d be exempt transportation workers. But,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nbecause Flowers essentially created its own\n\nin-house trucking company, it says that those\n\nsame truck drivers are no longer transportation\n\nworkers.\n\nThat distinction has no basis in the\n\ntext of the statute. Flowers\u0027 only attempt at a\n\ntextual argument is its invocation of ejusdem\n\ngeneris, but that argument fails from the start\n\nbecause Flowers can\u0027t identify a single example\n\nof the word \"seamen\" ever being defined based on\n\nwhether a worker\u0027s employer sold transportation.\n\nIn fact, if Flowers\u0027 drivers were on\n\nboats rather than trucks, under Flowers\u0027 own\n\ndefinition of \"seamen,\" they would be seamen.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Bissonnette v.

All\n\nworkers, all contracts of employment are subject\n\nto arbitration. It takes them out, but it takes\n\nthem out -- seemingly, you have to look at the\n\nlegal context, I would think, because they had a\n\nseparate arbitration regime that already\n\nexisted.\n\nIn other words, at least as I read the\n\nrecord, and it is murky in parts, I\u0027ll grant\n\nyou, as of 1925, Congress didn\u0027t want anyone to\n\nbe outside of arbitration. They wanted\n\nSection 2 for most workers and then not for\n\nseamen and railroad employees because there was\n\na separate arbitration regime.\n\nWhy, when we look at the common legal\n\ncontext that connects those terms, isn\u0027t that\n\nthe correct way to look at it? Why is that\n\nwrong?\n\nMS. BENNETT: There\u0027s two answers to\n\nthat. One is we know that Congress wasn\u0027t\n\nexempting just workers who had alternative\n\ndispute resolution regimes because it added the\n\nresidual clause, and that residual clause would\n\nhave covered no workers at all at the time.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"6","file_name":"Bissonnette v.

Arbitration Act, the Court should give\n\nthe word a different definition, and that\n\ndifferent definition should be something like\n\nworkers aboard a ship in a carrying trade\n\ncarrying goods for trade and commerce.\n\nAnd -- and there are two problems,\n\nthough, with this request. The first is not\n\nonly is this not the ordinary meaning of\n\n\"seamen\" in 1925, it\u0027s not any meaning ever of\n\n\"seamen\" in 1925 or since then. What that\n\ndefinition comes from is a definition that a\n\nsingle district court gave to the term \"merchant\n\nvessel,\" and the term \"merchant vessel\" is\n\nnowhere in the Federal Arbitration Act.\n\nSo Flowers has to demonstrate a\n\ncommonality between seamen and railroad\n\nemployees, not between railroad employees and\n\nmerchant vessels. So that\u0027s the first problem.\n\nIt\u0027s just not in the statute.\n\nThe second problem, though, is that\n\neven if this Court were willing to accept this\n\ndefinition of words that aren\u0027t even in the\n\nstatute as the definition of \"seamen\" for\n\npurposes of the Federal Arbitration Act and\n\ndefine it in accordance with what Flowers says\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n23\n\nOfficial\n\nwe should define it, Flowers\u0027 drivers meet its\n\nown definition.

to your\n\nquestion, which is sometimes they use FedEx,\n\nthat\u0027s correct, but if FedEx -- if we had used\n\nFedEx, the defendant in this suit wouldn\u0027t be\n\nFlowers Foods. It would be FedEx because the\n\ncontract of employment would be between FedEx\n\nand the worker.\n\nWhy would Congress do that? That was\n\nyour last question.
