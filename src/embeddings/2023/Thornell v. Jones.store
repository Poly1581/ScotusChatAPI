First, it failed to give any\n\ndeference to the district court\u0027s factual\n\ndeterminations.  After hearing the evidence and\n\ntestimony at the evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court made factual findings as to\n\nwhether Jones suffered from specific mental\n\nconditions and whether those conditions caused\n\nhim to murder Robert and Tisha Weaver.  The\n\nNinth Circuit disregarded those findings,\n\ninstead substituting its own judgment.\n\nMy friend defends this error by\n\npositing that the district court\u0027s only role was\n\nto determine whether unpresented mitigation\n\nevidence existed.  This view eviscerates the --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nthe traditional role of trial courts in the\n\nfact-finding process and would radically change\n\nhabeas practice, resulting in far more writs\n\nundoing state sentences.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit further erred by\n\nfailing to meaningfully consider the aggravating\n\nevidence or its weight.  Strickland does not\n\nallow for a sentence to be undone whenever there\n\nis some new mitigation that addresses moral\n\nculpability.  Instead, it requires a reasonable\n\nprobability that the new mitigation would have\n\nchanged the sentence in light of the balance\n\nbetween the total mitigation and the aggravating\n\nevidence.
