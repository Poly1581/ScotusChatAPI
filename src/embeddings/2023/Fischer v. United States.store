Many crimes\n\noccurred that day, but in plain English, the\n\nfundamental wrong committed by many of the\n\nrioters, including Petitioner, was a deliberate\n\nattempt to stop the joint session of Congress\n\nfrom certifying the results of the election.\n\nThat is, they obstructed Congress\u0027s work in that\n\nofficial proceeding.\n\nThe government accordingly charged\n\nPetitioner with violating Section 1512(c)(2), an\n\nobstruction offense that directly reads onto his\n\nconduct.\n\nThe case as it comes to this Court\n\npresents a straightforward question of statutory\n\ninterpretation:  Did Petitioner obstruct,\n\ninfluence, or impede the joint session of\n\nCongress?\n\nThe answer is equally straightforward.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"35","file_name":"Fischer v.

(c)(1) covers\n\neverything it enumerates.  It\u0027s the acts of\n\naltering, concealing, destroying records,\n\ndocuments, or other objects.  And then (c)(2)\n\nwould only pick up conduct that obstructs an\n\nofficial proceeding in a different way.\n\nSo there\u0027s no duplication or\n\nsuperfluity on our reading.  Instead, Congress\n\nwas taking this universe and dividing it up into\n\nthe two separate offenses.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s actually a virtue\n\nof our reading as compared to Petitioner\u0027s\n\nbecause I have not heard him articulate anything\n\nthat would fall within (c)(1) that wouldn\u0027t also\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n42\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"39","file_name":"Fischer v.

Let me\n\njust ask you a question or two about that.\n\nSuppose someone commits conduct that\n\nfalls squarely within 1512(d), the person\n\nintentionally harasses another person and\n\ntherefore dissuades that person from attending\n\nor testifying in an official proceeding.  So\n\nyou\u0027ve got a square -- you know, a clear\n\nviolation of 1512(d) punishable by no more than\n\nthree years in prison.\n\nBut, when Congress added 1512(c)(2),\n\nwhich seems to cover exactly that conduct, it\n\nsaid: Well, the punishment shouldn\u0027t be -- you\n\ncould punish that person for up to 20 years.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"78","file_name":"Fischer v.

And\n\nso the effect of the defendant\u0027s harassment\n\naction is to prevent the testimony or the\n\nproduction of the document.\n\nBut the government has not read that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n84\n\nOfficial\n\nstatute to require an actual intent to obstruct,\n\nwhich I think means there are certain factual\n\nscenarios where the government might be able to\n\nprove a 1512(d) offense without satisfying\n\n(c)(2).

So the charging decision wouldn\u0027t\n\nmake a difference with respect to the sentencing\n\nrange.\n\nAnd the concern you have with the\n\nhypothetical arises equally on Petitioner\u0027s\n\nreading because so too everything that would be\n\ncovered in 1512(d) falls within his evidence\n\nimpairment limitation.  So I don\u0027t think the\n\nexistence of a statutory max when there\u0027s no\n\nmandatory minimum should drive intuitions about\n\nhow to interpret this provision.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"79","file_name":"Fischer v.

to say precisely the\n\nopposite.  In fact, Yates drew a direct\n\ncomparison between 1519 on the one hand, which\n\nit said was a more narrow obstruction provision\n\nbased on some of the contextual clues there, and\n\n1512(c)(1) on the other hand, which has the\n\nphrase \"record, document, or other object,\" and\n\nsaid, well, that\u0027s the broad obstruction\n\nprovision.

This is the statute\n\nthat is aimed generally at official proceedings.\n\nIt\u0027s not more discrete.  And there are other\n\nprovisions like 1519 and some of the ones that\n\ncome right before it that are more narrowly\n\nconfined and are in -- intended to reflect\n\ndiscrete circumstances.  That doesn\u0027t describe\n\n1512 at all. So, when Congress was trying to\n\nbroadly prohibit obstruction of official\n\nproceedings, 1512 was exactly the right place to\n\ngo.\n\nThen Petitioner says, well, Congress\n\nburied it in the middle of the -- of the\n\nstatute.  But I -- I think it\u0027s actually quite\n\nexplicable when you look at how the other\n\nprovisions are structured.  1512(d), which I was\n\ndiscussing with Justice Alito, has a much more\n\nminimal penalty and doesn\u0027t require the intent\n\nto obstruct.  So it made sense to put 1512(c)\n\nbefore it but also after 1512(a), which is the\n\nmost serious obstruction, like killing a","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"89","file_name":"Fischer v.

He said they can\u0027t vote if\n\nthey can\u0027t breathe.
