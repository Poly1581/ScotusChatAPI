SANTOS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS.\n\nSANTOS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nNon-citizens who have lived here for\n\n10 years, have good moral character and a clean\n\nrecord, can seek immigration relief if their\n\nremoval will cause exceptional and extremely\n\nunusual hardship to a U.S. family member.  If\n\nthe agency concludes that the facts don\u0027t\n\nsatisfy that standard, the question here is\n\nwhether courts have the power to review that\n\ndecision.\n\nThey do. The INA limits review of\n\ndenials of discretionary relief, but it permits\n\nreview of questions of law.  And as this Court\n\nheld in Guerrero-Lasprilla, the statutory term\n\n\"questions of law\" includes the application of\n\nlegal standards to settled facts.

So, under\n\nGuerrero-Lasprilla, the agency\u0027s application of\n\nthat standard is reviewable.\n\nThe government argues that\n\nGuerrero-Lasprilla\u0027s holding applies only to\n\ncommon law standards and offers a different test\n\nfor statutory standards.  And while\n\njurisdictional tests are supposed to be simple,\n\nthe government\u0027s fashioned an elaborate and\n\namorphous framework that won\u0027t provide clear\n\nanswers.\n\nFirst, courts should see whether the\n\nstandard has a common law origin.

I think that\n\nvirtually every court on our side of the split\n\nhas agreed that it would be a -- a deferential\n\nstandard of review, and I think all of those\n\npractical considerations go to that point.\n\nBut one thing that I think is\n\ncritically important is that those practical\n\nconsiderations the Court said expressly in\n\nGuerrero-Lasprilla may be relevant to standard\n\nof review, but they\u0027re not relevant to whether\n\nthere\u0027s judicial review at all.\n\nAnd I think the reason for that is\n\nimportant.  That\u0027s because standard of review\n\nand reviewability have just totally different\n\nframeworks.  Reviewability looks at -- it\u0027s just\n\npurely an exercise in statutory construction.\n\nSo you\u0027re looking at the canons of statutory\n\ninterpretation.\n\nBut, when you\u0027re looking at standard\n\nof review, you use different decision-making\n\ncriteria.

And in Patel, this Court was very clear\n\nthat \"any\" meant \"any.\"\n\nThat included subjective and objective\n\ndeterminations.  That included the\n\nquintessentially discretionary determination of\n\nthe -- at the second step as to whether an\n\neligible non-citizen is -- should receive\n\ncancellation of removal.  But it also included\n\ncredibility determinations, which the Court\n\nrecognized required some objective fact-finding\n\nbut also some exercise of discretion.  And it\n\nincluded simply finding historical facts.

inclined to\n\nmake, but one might say, look, all right, here\u0027s\n\nGuerrero-Lasprilla.

And that\u0027s\n\none way to read Guerrero-Lasprilla.\n\nIf you read it for all it\u0027s worth, as\n\nbroadly as some of the questions suggest, it has\n\nthe effect of making everything reviewable.  And\n\n-- and that is a strange way to read a statute\n\nthat begins by saying that judgments are not\n\nreviewable.\n\nIf -- so the test would be this, and\n\nit isn\u0027t really all that complicated.

Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nI have about 42 points I\u0027d like to\n\naddress on rebuttal, but I will settle for about\n\nfive.\n\nFirst, I think that my friend on the\n\nother side has mistakenly focused a lot of her\n\nargument on what Congress did in 1996.  This\n\ncase is about what Congress did in 2005 when it\n\ncreated an exception to Section 1250 --\n\n1252(a)(2)(B) and it -- it amended both\n\n(a)(2)(B) and (a)(2)(D) to make clear that the\n\nlimited review provision trumps the designation\n\nof a particular determination as discretionary.\n\nSecond, Your Honor, I think all of my\n\nfriend\u0027s arguments about this not being a legal\n\nstandard really run smack into the Board\u0027s own\n\nunderstanding of what the -- the hardship\n\ndetermination is.  The Board said itself no more\n\nthan -- no less than a dozen times in its\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n100\n\nOfficial\n\nprecedential decision in Monreal-Aguinaga that\n\nthis is a standard.  It used its -- its\n\npurported authority under Chevron to interpret\n\nthat standard using the canons of statutory\n\nconstruction that courts use day in and day out.\n\nAnd it said the meaning of that standard can be\n\nfurther given -- given -- shed light on it","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"93","file_name":"Wilkinson v.
