BEARD, II\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. BEARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThe county refused to give George\n\nSheetz a permit to build a home unless he paid a\n\nsubstantial fee to finance public road\n\nimprovements.  He was faced with an impossible\n\nchoice:  the taking of over $23,000 or the\n\nability to use his land.  Though the fee went\n\nbeyond mitigation, he did submit to the fee and\n\npaid under protest.  After all, the permit was\n\nworth far more than the fee.\n\nThat\u0027s the same improper leveraging\n\nthat led to this Court\u0027s rule in Nollan, Dolan,\n\nand Koontz that all permit exactions should be\n\nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Such review is\n\nneeded to ensure that the government is not\n\ncommitting a taking in the guise of the police\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\npower to mitigate for land use impacts.  Yet,\n\nthe lower court refused to apply Nollan/Dolan\n\nsimply because the fee came from a legislative,\n\npreset, generally applicable schedule that the\n\ncounty had adopted.\n\nThe decision below is as wrong as it\n\nis dangerous.  First, nothing in the Court\u0027s\n\nexactions precedents, the Takings Clause, or the\n\nunconstitutional conditions doctrine justifies\n\nthat broad exception.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Sheetz v.

I -- I think my answer\n\nwould be similar, is that I think it would be an\n\nodd opinion to write where it was not the rule\n\nthat was applied below.  But I\u0027ll take the\n\nhypothetical.  And even there, I think what --\n\nwhat -- what is apparent from the briefing and\n\nwhat you hear from the arguments today is that\n\nthe core of this disagreement is about whether\n\nall permit conditions are or are not subject to\n\nNollan/Dolan.  That\u0027s the very premise of the\n\nQP, is whether there\u0027s an exemption --\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, no.

But, in both\n\ninstances, there are executive actors applying\n\nlegislative commands, and we\u0027re being asked, I\n\nthink, just to decide whether that makes a\n\ndifference.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"53","file_name":"Sheetz v.

I\n\nthink it was clear in his introduction this\n\nmorning and has been clear throughout the\n\nbriefing if you look at pages 25 to 26 in\n\nparticular of the blue brief that he\u0027s not\n\nmaking any sort of claim regarding a taking of\n\nhis property, meaning the physical real\n\nproperty.\n\nWhat he is claiming is that this\n\n$23,000 fee is itself a taking.  And we think\n\nthat is not correct for all of the reasons that\n\nhave already been discussed this morning and\n\nthat many of you have recognized.\n\nI think this Court in Koontz talked\n\nabout taxes, user fees, and similar laws and\n\nregulations, so I don\u0027t think that to prevail\n\nthe county necessarily has to show that this is\n\na tax or a user fee, but as Justice Barrett\n\npointed out earlier, I think it is quite similar\n\nto the class of special assessments that this\n\nCourt has held for a hundred-plus years in cases\n\nlike Houck and Fallbrook and French are not\n\nsubject to any sort of takings analysis or any","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"76","file_name":"Sheetz v.
