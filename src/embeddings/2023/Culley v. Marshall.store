PETITIONERS\n\nMR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe question presented is narrow:\n\nShould courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess\n\nthe sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture\n\nproceedings?  The answer is Mathews.\n\nMathews is the default due process\n\nstandard for civil cases and for good reason.\n\nIt assesses both the private and governmental\n\ninterests to guard against unreasonable risks of\n\nerror. And the Court has consistently applied\n\nit to determine whether more process is due,\n\nincluding in Good, another civil forfeiture\n\ncase.\n\nRespondents prefer Barker because\n\nBarker\u0027s answer is always no additional process.\n\nBut Respondents\u0027 primary argument is just that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\n$8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the\n\nquestion, not that Barker makes sense and\n\nMathews doesn\u0027t.\n\nRespondents are wrong.

So we\u0027re\n\nleaving room for flexibility.\n\nThe second point, with respect to\n\nhistory, I don\u0027t think the history provides a\n\nclear answer for us here.  First, at common law,\n\nproperty could be forfeited regardless of\n\nwhether the owner was innocent.  The innocent\n\nowner defense is something that didn\u0027t exist at\n\ncommon law.  And, again, that gives rise to new\n\nprocedural protections.\n\nSecond, as Justice Thomas explained in\n\nthe -- in his Leonard versus Texas dissent from\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\ndenial, historical forfeiture laws were quite\n\nlimited.  They were limited to a few specific\n\nsubject areas, like customs and piracy, where it\n\nmade some sense to think about in rem\n\nproceedings.  Civil forfeiture today bears\n\nlittle resemblance to that.\n\nAs Justice Thomas also pointed out\n\nthere, there\u0027s some question about whether, at\n\ncommon law, forfeiture was civil or criminal and\n\nwhether it carried the additional protections of\n\ncriminal process.\n\nAt the founding, forfeiture\n\nproceedings had to move quickly. The IJ brief,\n\nInstitute for Justice brief, explains that\n\ncourts had to rule within 14 days of the filing\n\ndate at common law.

He chose the option of\n\nremission rather than forfeiture, and he wanted\n\nthe remission hearing to happen quickly.\n\nAnd the Court, I thought, in the\n\nlanguage that has been quoted, was making a much\n\nmore narrow point, which is just that this\n\nremission is not a part of the forfeiture\n\nhearing.

Not every purportedly innocent\n\nowner is innocent, and not everyone is even an\n\nowner.\n\nAnd this is another problem with\n\nrushing this hearing, is that someone could come\n\nforward and claim ownership but not actually\n\nhave proper ownership.  And if it\u0027s happening\n\ntoo quickly, then the actually innocent owner\n\nmay be out his property and it\u0027s not going to be\n\nthere at the final forfeiture hearing, which is\n\nwhy the government has always had this authority\n\nto seize before a hearing, and the same\n\ninterests that have long justified seizure\n\nbefore a hearing justify not turning the stuff\n\nback over immediately after the seizure but,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n76\n\nOfficial\n\nrather, holding it until you can have a prompt\n\nbut accurate final hearing.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  General, can I ask","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"67","file_name":"Culley v.

REAVES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nI think it may be helpful for me to\n\nlay out how the federal government sees this\n\ncase. In our view, the Court has already found,\n\nas indicated in $8,850 and Von Neumann, that the\n\nonly process a claimant is entitled to after\n\npersonal property is seized is a timely final\n\nforfeiture hearing.\n\nIf this Court is of the view that it\n\nhas not yet addressed that issue, it should now,\n\nand it should hold that a claimant has no right\n\nto an interim post-seizure hearing.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"81","file_name":"Culley v.

How do we look at the significance\n\nof that -- that gap?\n\nMS. REAVES: So I think the Court\n\nwould look at that under $8,850 because $8,850\n\nallows the Court to take into consideration the\n\nburden to a particular claimant in a particular\n\ncase. I think that comes in under the first\n\nfactor in $8,850.\n\nAnd I think, you know, the government\n\ninterests really aren\u0027t any different.  You\n\nknow, this Court\u0027s talked about the government\n\ninterests in Pearson Yacht in not having a\n\npre-seizure hearing. And I think most of those\n\ngovernment interests continue to apply to allow\n\nthe government -- and -- to retain the property\n\nwhile the hearing is proceeding, you know, as\n\nlong as the hearing is proceeding in an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n94\n\nOfficial\n\nappropriate amount of time and the government\n\nisn\u0027t sitting on its hands and doing nothing\n\nwhile holding someone\u0027s property.\n\nAnd I -- and I think the history and\n\ntradition really are consistent with that.  You\n\nknow, the best evidence of the history here\n\ncomes from the Collection Acts, which were\n\npassed by founding-era Congresses.  There was no\n\nrequirement that there be any sort of interim\n\nhearing.

They should\n\nbe analyzed under Mathews because Mathews is the\n\ntest for determining whether additional process\n\nis due.  And then the lower courts and the\n\nstates and, if necessary, the federal government\n\ncan figure out how that works.\n\nNow, in terms of some of the\n\nflexibility that that might afford, the -- the\n\nfederal statute, 18 U.S.C. 983(f), it allows\n\nthe -- the -- or it entitles a claimant to the\n\nimmediate release of seized property if they can\n\nshow substantial hardship.
