trigger\n\nfinger on the built-in finger ledge and uses his\n\nother hand to press the front of the rifle\n\nforward.  As long as the shooter maintains that\n\nsteady forward pressure, the rifle will fire\n\ncontinuously until it runs out of bullets, and\n\nit will empty a 100-round magazine like the ones\n\nused in the Las Vegas shooting in about 10\n\nseconds.

FLETCHER:  That is the language\n\nwe\u0027re stuck with, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s as\n\nnarrow as you suggest for a couple of reasons.\n\nI agree it\u0027s awkward to talk about a person\n\nfunctioning a trigger, but there\u0027s an easy\n\nexplanation.

One is that\u0027s the way it\u0027s\n\nbeen understood ever since.  The interpretation\n\nI\u0027m giving you is the same one Karl Frederick,\n\nthe president of the NRA, and many other courts,\n\nexecutive officials, Congressmen gave at the\n\nsame time.  They used \"pull\" and \"function\"\n\ninterchangeably.\n\nAnd, second, I think, even if you\u0027ve\n\nsaid we\u0027re going to focus just on the trigger,\n\nthe function of an object isn\u0027t just some action\n\nby the object.

I think -- we get into this a\n\nlittle bit in the reply in response -- or a -- a\n\ndifferent argument maybe than the one that\n\nyou\u0027re thinking of but I think related, in\n\nresponse to a move that\u0027s made in the red brief,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nwhere we hypothesize that if you had a\n\nmachinegun that required you to pull the trigger\n\nand also hold down a button, it would still fire\n\nautomatically, and we all understand that, even\n\nthough you have to do two things rather than\n\none.\n\nAnd what my friend said in the red\n\nbrief is, well, in that case, maybe the button\n\nis part of the trigger too because you have to\n\npush the button to keep firing.  And what we say\n\nin the reply and what I think is true is that if\n\nyou were going to approach the statute that way,\n\nwhich isn\u0027t the way the ATF has, I think you\u0027d\n\nstill land in the same place because then you\u0027d\n\nsay, it\u0027s both the curved metal lever and it\u0027s\n\nthe part on the front of the rifle that the user\n\npushes forward in order to initiate and maintain","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"30","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.

MITCHELL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. MITCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe statutory definition of machinegun\n\nextends only to weapons that fire more than one\n\nshot automatically by a single function of the\n\ntrigger.  Mr. Cargill\u0027s non-mechanical bump\n\nstocks fall outside the statutory definition for\n\ntwo separate and independent reasons.\n\nFirst, a bump stock-equipped rifle can\n\nfire only one shot per function of the trigger\n\nbecause the trigger must reset after every shot\n\nand must function again before another shot can\n\nbe fired.\n\nThe trigger is the device that\n\ninitiates the firing of the weapon, and the\n\nfunction of the trigger is what that triggering\n\ndevice must do to cause the weapon to fire.\n\nThe phrase \"function of the trigger\"\n\ncan refer only to the trigger\u0027s function.  It\n\nhas nothing to do with the shooter or what the\n\nshooter does to the trigger because the shooter\n\ndoes not have a function.\n\nThe statute is concerned only with\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"43","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.

The question is, how\n\nmany functions of the trigger do we have for\n\neach of the shots?\n\nAnd the answer is one. If you divide\n\nthe number of shots that are fired from a bump\n\nstock equipped rifle by the number of times the\n\ntrigger has to function to produce that shot,\n\nthe answer will always be one, and it will\n\nremain that way because nothing in the\n\ntriggering mechanism has changed.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"78","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.

There\u0027s still a function of the\n\ntrigger if the weapon falls on to the floor and\n\ngoes off accidentally with a discharge.  The\n\ntrigger has functioned even though the shooter\n\nhasn\u0027t pulled the trigger or pushed it or bumped\n\nit. What matters under the statute is what the\n\ntrigger does.\n\nAnd all these examples that we see in\n\nthe Solicitor General\u0027s brief, Justice Gorsuch\n\nmentioned this earlier, when they\u0027re taking\n\ntransitive verbs, when they say \"swing of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n94\n\nOfficial\n\nbat\" or \"stroke of the key\" or \"roll of the\n\ndice,\" all of those are transitive verbs that\n\nare capable of taking an object.\n\nSo, when you see \"swing of the bat,\"\n\nthere\u0027s obviously an unnamed actor in that\n\nsentence that is the subject of the verb\n\n\"swing.\"  The bat can\u0027t swing itself.  The bat\u0027s\n\nan inanimate object.\n\nFunction of the trigger is entirely\n\ndifferent. Function is an intransitive verb.\n\nIt can\u0027t take an object grammatically.  It\u0027s\n\nimpossible.
