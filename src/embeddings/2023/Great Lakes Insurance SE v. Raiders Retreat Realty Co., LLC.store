This\n\nCourt should do the same for three reasons.\n\nFirst, logic and consistency.  We\u0027re\n\nhere talking about a federal exception to a\n\nfederal presumption of enforceability.  It\n\nstands to reason that federal exception would\n\nlook to federal public policy, not state public\n\npolicy.  Raiders doesn\u0027t point to any analogous\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nfederal exception.  It looks to state public\n\npolicy.  And it doesn\u0027t explain why choice of\n\nlaw in maritime should be any different from\n\nforum selection in maritime.\n\nSecond, the consensus approach makes\n\npractical sense for the reasons that this Court\n\ngave in The Bremen.  Judging choice-of-law\n\nclauses by reference to a uniform body of\n\nfederal law accords with ancient concepts of\n\nfreedom of contract, and it allows parties to\n\ngauge and price their risks knowing what law\n\nwill apply to their contracts.  If 50 states may\n\nset aside parties\u0027 choices based on their own\n\npublic policies, that would be a reference for\n\nuncertainty and forum shopping.\n\nThird, the consensus approach is clear\n\nand administrable.  On our approach, a federal\n\ncourt would ask, does a choice-of-law clause\n\noffend federal admiralty policy? The answer to\n\nthat question will almost always be no.

So I guess, Justice Kagan,\n\nwhat I\u0027d say is, if you picked up only Wilburn\n\nBoat, I could understand the other side\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting

If you picked up only Bremen and\n\nCarnival, I think we\u0027d clearly be right.\n\nSo then the question is, well, which\n\ndistinction makes more sense?

BASHMAN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. BASHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn this maritime insurance case, the\n\nCourt considers whether a state choice-of-law\n\nprovision in an insurance policy is subject to\n\nthe same fundamental public policy exception\n\nthat applies everywhere outside of admiralty or\n\nwhether only a strong federal public policy will\n\nsuffice to overcome the insurance company\u0027s\n\nstate choice-of-law clause.\n\nThe Third Circuit reached the correct\n\nresult here for two reasons.  First, under\n\nWilburn Boat, state law applies. As a result,\n\nthe fundamental public policy of the state with\n\nthe greatest connection to the dispute can\n\noverride the contractual choice-of-law\n\nprovision, selecting the law of another state.\n\nAnd, second, should this Court see a\n\nneed to announce a federal common law rule to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n41","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"36","file_name":"Great Lakes Insurance SE v.

this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Lauritzen, all federal.\n\nIt\u0027s not diversity, it\u0027s not Klaxon, you don\u0027t\n\nlook to state law.  There\u0027s a federal\n\nchoice-of-law test in admiralty.\n\nAll right. We put the choice-of-law\n\nclause in the contract, what now?  We have a\n\npresumption. Well, it wouldn\u0027t be much of a\n\npresumption if federal law goes if 50 states\n\ncould just set it aside.  That\u0027s Justice\n\nJackson\u0027s point.\n\nAnd even looking at the facts of this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n76\n\nOfficial\n\ncase, it seems to have a fairly international\n\nflavor.  You have a German insurer.  You have an\n\ninsured in Pennsylvania that designates an agent\n\nin the contract in Florida, and the boat can\n\ntravel up and down the Eastern Seaboard and the\n\nBahamas, nowhere else. That\u0027s the navigational\n\nlimit.\n\nThat sure triggers some interests of\n\nPennsylvania, but it doesn\u0027t seem like the only\n\nstate in play, and more importantly, it seems\n\nlike the sort of national and international\n\nthing that triggers the broader purposes of\n\nmaritime.\n\nBut even if you didn\u0027t buy all of\n\nthat, we do have The Bremen.  The best reading\n\nof The Bremen is that public policy is federal\n\npublic policy, not state public policy.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"70","file_name":"Great Lakes Insurance SE v.
