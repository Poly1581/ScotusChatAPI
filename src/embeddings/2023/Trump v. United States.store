Framers of our\n\nConstitution viewed an energetic executive as\n\nessential to securing liberty.\n\nIf a president can be charged, put on\n\ntrial, and imprisoned for his most controversial\n\ndecisions as soon as he leaves office, that\n\nlooming threat will distort the president\u0027s\n\ndecision-making precisely when bold and fearless\n\naction is most needed.  Every current president\n\nwill face de facto blackmail and extortion by\n\nhis political rivals while he is still in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\noffice.\n\nThe implications of the Court\u0027s\n\ndecision here extend far beyond the facts of\n\nthis case.  Could President George W. Bush have\n\nbeen sent to prison for obstructing an official\n\nproceeding or allegedly lying to Congress to\n\ninduce war in Iraq?  Could President Obama be\n\ncharged with murder for killing U.S. citizens\n\nabroad by drone strike?  Could President Biden\n\nsomeday be charged with unlawfully inducing\n\nimmigrants to enter the country illegally for\n\nhis border policies?\n\nThe answer to all these questions is\n\nno. Prosecuting the president for his official\n\nacts is an innovation with no foothold in\n\nhistory or tradition and incompatible with our\n\nconstitutional structure.  The original meaning\n\nof the Executive Vesting Clause, the Framers\u0027\n\nunderstanding and intent, an unbroken historical\n\ntradition spanning 200 years, and policy\n\nconsiderations rooted in the separation of\n\npowers all counsel against it.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Trump v.

DREEBEN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis Court has never recognized\n\nabsolute criminal immunity for any public\n\nofficial.  Petitioner, however, claims that a\n\nformer president has permanent criminal immunity\n\nfor his official acts, unless he was first\n\nimpeached and convicted.  His novel theory would\n\nimmunize former presidents from criminal\n\nliability for bribery, treason, sedition,\n\nmurder, and, here, conspiring to use fraud to\n\noverturn the results of an election and\n\nperpetuate himself in power.\n\nSuch presidential immunity has no\n\nfoundation in the Constitution.  The Framers\n\nknew too well the dangers of a king who could do\n\nno wrong.  They therefore devised a system to\n\ncheck abuses of power, especially the use of\n\nofficial power for private gain.\n\nHere, the executive branch is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n69\n\nOfficial\n\nenforcing congressional statutes and seeking\n\naccountability for Petitioner\u0027s alleged misuse\n\nof official power to subvert democracy.

It seems likely that the Framers\n\ndesigned the Constitution that way because, at\n\nthe time of the founding, presidents had no\n\ntwo-term limit.
