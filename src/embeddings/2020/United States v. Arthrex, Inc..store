How would -- how\n\n9    would we define -- discern what is substantial?\n\n10              MR.

But the Court in Edmond said the fact\n\n18    that the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\n\n19    can\u0027t second-guess the factual determinations of\n\n20    the lower court is not sufficient to make those\n\n21    lower court judges principal officers.\n\n22              Things can slip through the cracks and\n\n23    supervision can, nevertheless, be sufficient.\n\n24    And that\u0027s essentially what we have here.

             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Stewart, the\n\n10    other side\u0027s case comes down basically, I think,\n\n11    to just saying you\u0027re not an inferior officer if\n\n12    you can make final decisions that are\n\n13    unreviewable by the director.  That\u0027s a fairly\n\n14    straightforward line.\n\n15              Yours is a bit more amorphous.  I\n\n16    think it\u0027s what the Chief was getting to.  But I\n\n17    think that what I want to understand is, what is\n\n18    your final test being judged against?  Is it --\n\n19    I mean, I thought I heard a little bit of the --\n\n20    of it when you said the director is setting the\n\n21    policies and procedures.  He is -- he or she is\n\n22    the person who controls the outcome in the sense\n\n23    of setting what the policies and procedures are.\n\n24              Am I right that that\u0027s your baseline?\n\n25              MR.

And I would agree that we don\u0027t\n\n2    have a bright-line test, but that\u0027s in part\n\n3    because this Court has emphasized that there is\n\n4    no exclusive criterion for determining inferior\n\n5    versus principal officer status.\n\n6              And what we are emphasizing is that\n\n7    the director has really two different forms of\n\n8    control.

   Service, members of that have a lot of authority\n\n20    in dozens of different areas and in different\n\n21    kinds of officials, and did you find any good\n\n22    examples which would help you

The ultimate -- what the Board\n\n7    decided in this case is that the priority date\n\n8    of this patent was May 8, 2014.  That is not a\n\n9    decision that our constitution requires to be\n\n10    made by a principal officer or even reviewed by\n\n11    a principal officer.\n\n12              It\u0027s a narrow, case-specific, factual\n\n13    question that the board answered and we believe\n\n14    answered correctly.  So -- so the answer to your\n\n15    question is, yes, there are many such officers,\n\n16    but -- but they are generally given the\n\n17    opportunity to decide narrow, case-specific,\n\n18    application-specific questions rather than broad\n\n19    questions of national policy.

question and the history here, but,\n\n17    in answer to Justice Kagan, is it -- is it fair\n\n18    to say that, yes, this is a rare bird in that in\n\n19    this area, maybe for historically contingent\n\n20    reasons maybe considered, maybe not, this is an\n\n21    unusual animal in the sense that there isn\u0027t\n\n22    final review in the agency head?\n\n23              MR.

And the Patent\n\n4    Office doesn\u0027t.\n\n5              Of course, before that, there were\n\n6    many others.  That\u0027s why the APA was enacted.\n\n7    And we would submit that the Appointments Clause\n\n8    is not a super APA.

You\n\n15    mentioned that the other side\u0027s argument rests\n\n16    on a single line from Edmond.  That, of course,\n\n17    is the critical line from Edmond about the\n\n18    administrative judge context.\n\n19              Just to pick up on Justice Gorsuch,\n\n20    this does seem, and I think you acknowledged, a\n\n21    -- a significant departure from general\n\n22    historical practice since the APA, which is a\n\n23    yellow flag, if not a red flag.\n\n24              And then your test to try to deal with\n\n25    that seems to resurrect Morrison v. Olson\u0027s\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n42\n\n1    test.  I thought we\u0027d gotten away from that in\n\n2    -- in Edmond.

Their decisions are the\n\n12    executive\u0027s final word resolving billion-dollar\n\n13    disputes affecting the innovation landscape.\n\n14    They can even overturn earlier decisions by\n\n15    their own agency head to grant a patent.\n\n16              No superior in the executive has\n\n17    authority to review their decisions, to overturn\n\n18    their exercise of government authority.\n\n19    Accountability suffers.  If a principal officer\n\n20    has review authority but refuses to exercise it\n\n21    and overrule subordinates, the President and the\n\n22    public can hold him accountable for that choice.\n\n23              But the principal is not accountable\n\n24    if the answer is, I have no authority.

of their decisions could ever be countermanded\n\n11    by a superior, which is why the Federal\n\n12    Circuit\u0027s remedy striking APJ tenure protection\n\n13    is no remedy at all.  APJs would still be the\n\n14    final word of the executive for the cases they\n\n15    decide, and it subjects APJs to unseen,\n\n16    behind-the-scenes pressures through which\n\n17    superiors could evade accountability.\n\n18              How to fix the statute is for\n\n19    Congress.  Solutions point in the opposite\n\n20    direction.

It said there\u0027s multiple possibilities\n\n20    of how the statute could be changed, but we are\n\n21    not the institution to be -- to doing it.  The\n\n22    legislature has to make that change.\n\n23              And I think that\u0027s precisely the case\n\n24    here because the possible solutions point in\n\n25    diametrically opposite directions.

The other\n\n4    would be to make them truly subordinate to the\n\n5    director by making their decisions not final and\n\n6    at least subject to the possibility of review by\n\n7    the director.\n\n8              But, since those and the multiple\n\n9    other possibilities point in such diametrically\n\n10    opposed directions, this Court should hold that\n\n11    this IPR cannot proceed because the system is\n\n12    not constitutional.  And then any remedy beyond\n\n13    that, any revision to the statute would be a\n\n14    matter for Congress to -- to address.\n\n15              JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.

process part without the\n\n19    agency review part, and you can either keep the\n\n20    review if you want to keep them as inferior\n\n21    officers, or if you want to avoid agency -- any\n\n22    agency review, Congress can do that too, but\n\n23    that, they\u0027d have to do presidential appointment\n\n24    and Senate confirmation of the APJs, correct?\n\n25              MR.
