district court entered\n\nthe judgment in an action under Section 1346(b),\n\nso that judgment constitutes a complete bar to\n\nany action by Respondent against the federal\n\nemployees involved in his FTCA claim.  That\n\nbroad text unambiguously precludes Respondent\u0027s\n\nBivens action here, which asserts the same\n\ninjuries based on the very same subject matter.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit\u0027s refusal to apply\n\nthe judgment bar in this case rested on two\n\npropositions:  first, that when the United\n\nStates prevails in an FTCA action, the district\n\ncourt must necessarily dismiss for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction, and, second, that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nsuch a jurisdictional dismissal does not trigger\n\nthe judgment bar.\n\nBoth propositions are wrong.  This\n\nCourt rejected the Sixth Circuit\u0027s\n\njurisdictional analysis in FDIC v. Meyer, but\n\neven more important for present purposes, this\n\nCourt in Simmons v. Himmelreich squarely\n\nrejected the Sixth Circuit\u0027s conclusion that the\n\njudgment bar never applies to an FTCA judgment\n\nfor the government.\n\nThe Court held instead that the\n\njudgment bar does apply where a plaintiff simply\n\nfails to prove his claim.  And that conclusion\n\nfollows directly from the text of Section 2676,\n\nwhich makes \"the judgment\" in an FTCA action\n\npreclusive, without drawing any distinction\n\nbased on which side prevails.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Brownback v.

And I think you\n\ncan see that Section 2676 uses the term \"action\"\n\nto be essentially synonymous with \"claim\"\n\nbecause it refers to an action under\n\nSection 1346(b).  And so it\u0027s clearly tying the\n\n-- the word \"action\" to specific causes of\n\naction.\n\nBut, again, I think, if you put the\n\ncommon law, the classic canonical formulation of\n\nres judicata side by side with this statute, the\n\nkey difference you see is the deletion of the\n\nword \"subsequent\" and the replacement with the\n\nword \"any.\"\n\nSo I think it\u0027s not surprising that\n\nCongress would refer to preclusion of an action,\n\nbecause that\u0027s traditional common law res\n\njudicata.  What the difference was, was that\n\nthey eliminated the requirement that preclusion","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"5","file_name":"Brownback v.

The first\n\nargument we made in the Sixth Circuit was that\n\nthe reason the judgment bar shouldn\u0027t be applied\n\nto this case is because there\u0027s no chance of\n\nduplicative litigation when claims are brought\n\ntogether in the same action.\n\nAnd as the government has conceded,\n\nthis is also a point that we made in our brief\n\nin opposition to cert when that was filed.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I have one\n\nunrelated question, brief question.\n\nShould it matter in deciding this case","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"35","file_name":"Brownback v.

Yes, Your Honor.\n\nSo,\n\nlike -- as I mentioned earlier, there\u0027s no\n\nquestion that the Sixth Circuit didn\u0027t predicate\n\nits decision on this point.  But it was raised\n\nin the Sixth Circuit. And in the Simmons case,\n\nthis Court actually decided the FTCA decision on\n\na separate ground than the one that the Sixth\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nCircuit had used below.\n\nAnd so, here, I think the -- the\n\nexistence of the other circuit court\n\ndecisions -- which, as I mentioned, although\n\nthey somehow agree on this same claims point,\n\nthey do so in very different ways -- illustrates\n\nthat there\u0027s an enormous amount of confusion\n\nthat this Court could very simply clear up and\n\ndo so consistent with its decision in Simmons\n\nand Will, which is focused on stating that the\n\npurpose of the judgment bar is to prevent\n\nduplicative litigation, as this Court said in\n\nWill, multiple suits on identical matters.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, can I just\n\nstop you there?

Review\n\ncreated just such an action by pleading a demand\n\nfor relief alleging the elements of Section\n\n1346(b), and the district court indisputably\n\nentered judgment.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit explained at\n\nPetition Appendix 1A, Note 1, why the district\n\ncourt\u0027s judgment is best understood as a summary\n\njudgment in favor of the government, because\n\nboth parties submitted a body of extensive\n\nevidentiary exhibits in support of the motion.\n\nBut even if the Court concluded that\n\nthe judgment was best understood as a dismissal\n\nfor failure to state a claim, it makes no\n\ndifference because it\u0027s still the judgment in an\n\naction under Section 1346(b), as Meyer\n\nexplained, and this Court\u0027s canonical decision\n\nin Bell v. Hood makes clear that a dismissal for\n\nfailure to state a claim for relief is a\n\ndecision on the merits and, therefore,\n\npreclusive.\n\nThe surest way to know Respondent\u0027s\n\nmain argument on the question presented is\n\nincorrect is that it forces my friend into the\n\nextraordinary conclusion that the judgment bar\n\nis not triggered by a judgment in favor of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n66\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nUnited States on the FTCA action.
