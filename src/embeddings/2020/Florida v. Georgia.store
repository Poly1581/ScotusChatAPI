Special Master immediately short-circuited\n\nthat inquiry by finding that Florida has not\n\nbeen harmed at all as a result of Georgia\u0027s\n\nexploding irrigation use along the Flint River.\n\nThat finding, which is overwhelmingly\n\nrefuted by the evidence, corrupted his entire\n\nanalysis.  The Special Master relied on the\n\nsupposed absence of harm in concluding that\n\nGeorgia\u0027s consumption was reasonable.

Those findings\n\nalone compel the conclusion that Georgia\u0027s\n\nunrestrained consumption is unreasonable.\n\nUnder the balancing called for by this\n\nCourt, the evidence overwhelmingly establishes\n\nthat Florida would significantly benefit from a\n\ndecree and that meaningful relief is available\n\nfor little or even no cost to Georgia.  In fact,\n\nhundreds of additional CFS inflows could be\n\ngenerated at zero cost simply by halting illegal\n\nirrigation, eliminating overwatering, and\n\nscheduling irrigation to maximize its impact.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Florida v.

I mean, first, this\n\nCourt made clear that each state has an equal\n\nright to the reasonable use of the waters.\n\nGeorgia has never disputed that Florida\u0027s\n\ndecision to use the waters to replenish an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nirreplaceable ecological resource is reasonable.\n\nAnd Georgia\u0027s use is extinguishing that right.\n\nSo I don\u0027t think that the pure\n\ndollar-and-cents inquiry in that respect is\n\ncorrect.  And I think New Jersey versus New York\n\nproves that because, if it really just came down\n\nto oysters versus, you know, lots of people or\n\notherwise, then New York City would have crushed\n\nNew Jersey in that case, and that\u0027s not the way\n\nit worked out.\n\nAnd I also would say that Special\n\nMaster Kelly\u0027s cost estimates were fatally\n\nflawed, in particular insofar as they rely on\n\nthe premise that our remedy would wipe out\n\nirrigation altogether.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"22","file_name":"Florida v.

GARRE: Well, I think Dr. Allan,\n\nas well as Dr. Clawndaw, described the harms,\n\nyou know, over time and in more recent periods.\n\nI mean, what\u0027s happening is that sloughs are\n\nbecoming disconnected, and, in particular,\n\nmussels are drying up. The U.S. Fish and\n\nWildlife Service itself has recognized that, and\n\nit, you know, condemned Georgia\u0027s consumption.\n\nI point you to FX 46, 47, and 48 in particular\n\non that, where they\u0027ve raised increasing alarm\n\nbells about Georgia\u0027s consumption and its impact\n\non the mussels in that area.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"30","file_name":"Florida v.

Simply put, Florida\n\nfailed to prove its case.  On this record, after\n\na five-week trial, Florida has not shown by\n\nclear and convincing evidence that Georgia\n\ncaused Florida\u0027s alleged harms.  And Florida\n\nalso failed to show that the benefits of the\n\ndecree it seeks substantially outweigh the harm\n\nit might cause.\n\nFlorida\u0027s oyster allegations prove the\n\npoint. Florida failed to demonstrate that\n\nGeorgia\u0027s water use caused the oyster collapse.\n\nInstead, the record shows that Florida allowed\n\noyster fishing at unprecedented levels in the\n\nyears preceding the collapse.  As one Florida\n\nofficial said at the time, they bent their\n\noyster fishery until it broke.\n\nTo remedy this self-inflicted wound,\n\nFlorida asks the Court to impose draconian caps\n\non Georgia.

The first point I would make\n\nis that Florida is making a completely inapt\n\ncomparison by comparing the ACF basin prior to\n\nthe building of the dams and reservoirs and the\n\nArmy Corps operations post.\n\nThe Army Corps has the overriding\n\ninfluence in the amount and timing of flow from\n\nGeorgia into Florida, and the reason that there\n\nwere more days closer to 5,000 is because the\n\nArmy Corps is controlling those flows in a way\n\nthat did not exist previously.

So the water\u0027s not disappearing.\n\nThere\u0027s just less of it.

harm to Georgia, what do we\n\ndo with -- with that data?\n\nIf it\u0027s just a matter of calculating\n\nthe dollar value of Georgia agriculture and the\n\nFlorida oyster and seafood industry, that\u0027s\n\npretty straightforward.\n\nBut Mr. Garre appropriately mentions\n\nthat what is at stake is a precious ecosystem.\n\nSo how do we take that into account?  And in\n\nanswering that, maybe you could answer this --\n\nthis question: To what degree are these oyster\n\nbeds a natural phenomenon and to what degree are\n\nthey a man-made creation?\n\nWas something like this present when\n\nPonce de Leon sailed up, or is this something\n\nthat oyster farmers have created?\n\nMR.

And I\u0027ll -- let me put\n\nit to you this way:  What if the injury was, in\n\nfact, modest, but it would be virtually costless\n\nto Georgia to remedy it?  Would we still say\n\nthat that wouldn\u0027t justify an equitable decree?\n\nSo was Judge Kelly right to say that a modest\n\ninjury doesn\u0027t justify an equitable decree?\n\nMR.
