And\n\nCongress included a proviso there saying that,\n\nfor -- for the avoidance of doubt, that\n\ndefinition includes ANCs.\n\nNow, in the most recent law, the\n\nAmerica Rescue Plan Act, Congress provided\n\nadditional funds, coronavirus relief funds to\n\nstate and local governments and to tribal\n\ngovernments using the List Act definition, which\n\nexcludes ANCs.

would just like to emphasize again a\n\ncouple of the points that I touched on this\n\nmorning.\n\nFirst, ISDA\u0027s definition of \"Indian\n\nTribes\" should not be read to be at war with\n\nitself. Congress did not deliberately and\n\nspecifically include ANCs in one clause only to\n\nthen exclude them in the very next clause.\n\nNow our principal argument is that\n\nthat if \"recognition\" is understood as a term of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n35\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nart, then the clause should not apply to ANCs,\n\nbut we would accept a decision under which\n\n\"recognition\" is given a somewhat more capacious\n\nmeaning, and -- and the ANCs satisfy that.\n\nSecond, I just want to emphasize again\n\nthat the question presented here arises under\n\nthe CARES Act, which Congress enacted in 2020,\n\nand by that time, there can be no real question\n\nthat the ISDA definition was uniformly\n\nunderstood to include ANCs, even though they are\n\nnot federally recognized Indian Tribes.\n\nThat was the administrative\n\nconstruction, it was the Ninth Circuit\u0027s\n\nconstruction in the Cook Inlet case, the\n\nconstruction articulated in all of the leading\n\ntreatises in this area.  That\u0027s the meaning\n\nCongress incorporated, and that\u0027s the meaning we\n\nask this Court to endorse.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nMr. Clement.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"31","file_name":"Yellen v.

ANCs\n\nhave never been sovereign, but they have always\n\nplayed a critical role in distributing special\n\nfederal Indian benefits to Alaska natives.\n\nCongress specifically added ANCs to\n\nISDEAA\u0027s definition of \"Indian Tribes.\"\n\nRespondents, however, contend that Congress\n\naccomplished nothing because ANCs do not satisfy\n\nthe eligibility clause.\n\nBut, if that clause is only given its\n\nordinary meaning, ANCs plainly satisfy it.\n\nCongress said \"recognized as eligible,\" not\n\n\"recognized as sovereigns,\" and ANCs have long\n\nbeen recognized as eligible for special federal\n\nIndian benefits starting with the Settlement\n\nAct.\n\nIf, instead, the phrase is given a\n\nterm-of-art meaning restricted to sovereign\n\ntribes, then it is wholly inapplicable to\n\nentities established by Congress as alternatives\n\nto sovereign tribes.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"32","file_name":"Yellen v.

canon.\n\nIs it your understanding, I think,\n\nfrom what you\u0027re saying that the canon is\n\nsomething of an exception to ordinary meaning?\n\nIn other words, sometimes you\u0027ll look at a\n\nphrase or words and say the ordinary meaning is\n\nX, but the term of art that we know is -- is Y?\n\nIs that your understanding of how it works?\n\nMR.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nIn the end, whether the eligibility\n\nclause has an ordinary meaning that ANCs satisfy\n\nor a term-of-art meaning that is wholly\n\ninapplicable to them, there is no cause for\n\ninterpreting ISDEAA or the CARES Act to exclude\n\nANCs and the natives they serve.\n\nAlaska natives were eligible for\n\nspecial federal Indian benefits long before the\n\nSettlement Act in ISDEAA.  Nothing in either\n\nstatute terminated those benefits or made them\n\nturn on membership in a sovereign tribe.\n\nTo the contrary, the Settlement Act\n\ntold every Alaska native to enroll not in a\n\nvillage but in a regional ANC.

RASMUSSEN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\nMR.\n\nRASMUSSEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nA unanimous panel of the D.C. Circuit\n\nhad no difficulty concluding that ANCs do not\n\nqualify as Indian Tribes under ISDEAA and -- and\n\nthus under the CARES Act.  As the court of\n\nappeals explained, under basic English sentence\n\nconstruction, the recognition clause\n\nunambiguously applies to each of the nouns that\n\nprecedes it, including each ANC.  And by\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nreferring to groups recognized as eligible for\n\nthe special programs available to Indians, the\n\nrecognition clause plainly refers to the formal\n\nrecognition -- recognized status.\n\nIndeed, the U.S. agreed with that\n\nuntil this case reached this Court.  Petitioners\n\ncontend that the court of appeals\u0027\n\ninterpretation would render this statute\u0027s\n\ninclusion of ANCs super -- superfluous.\n\nThis is wrong for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the cardinal rule is the plain\n\nmeaning, and the English language construction\n\nof the sentence is simple and clear.\n\nSecond, as Petitioners do not even\n\ncontest, the political branches could, both in\n\n1975 and today, have believed that their plenary\n\nauthority allowed them to recognize ANCs.\n\nTherefore, there is no super --\n\nsuperfluity problem.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"54","file_name":"Yellen v.

In fact, that has been proposed on\n\noccasion.\n\nSo there -- there\u0027s certainly the\n\npossibility that ANCs, even if they didn\u0027t\n\nqualify at that time, could have been --\n\nCongress could have enacted something under its\n\nplenary power later to say that they were.\n\nWhether that would then be permissible would be\n\na separate issue for a later date.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why\n\nwould Congress put ANCs in the language and then\n\ntake them out?

If we\n\ndid that in this case, we wouldn\u0027t have had a\n\nproblem if they used perfect grammar.

you\u0027re arguing, I think,\n\nis that\u0027s clear today when the CARES Act was\n\npassed, but, as Justice Alito just pointed out,\n\nthen why would Congress have bothered to include\n\nANCs in the

I want\n\nto give you an opportunity to respond to how I\n\nthink the two statutory arguments on the other\n\nside merge potentially.\n\nSo it seems to me, if we start with\n\nthe text and we look at \"recognized as\n\neligible,\" we have a choice.  Do we read that in\n\nits ordinary meaning, as Mr. Clement says, or do\n\nwe read it as a term of art?\n\nAnd that\u0027s a choice we have, and we\n\nhave to figure out, how do we resolve that?  And\n\none of the ways we usually resolve that is\n\nlooking at the context to see how Congress might\n\nhave been using the phrase here.\n\nAnd once we broaden out the lens and\n\nlook at the context, we see the express\n\ninclusion of the ANCs and we see that they would\n\nbe left out completely, meaning many tens of\n\nthousands of native Alaskans would be left out\n\ncompletely not only from the CARES Act but from\n\nmany other social services statutes.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"81","file_name":"Yellen v.
