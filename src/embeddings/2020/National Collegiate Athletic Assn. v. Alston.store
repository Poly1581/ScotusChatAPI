WAXMAN: Good morning, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nFor more than a hundred years, the\n\ndistinct character of college sports has been\n\nthat it\u0027s played by students who are amateurs,\n\nwhich is to say that they are not paid for their\n\nplay. Maintaining that distinct character is\n\nboth procompetitive, because it differentiates\n\nthe NCAA\u0027s product from professional sports, and\n\ncan be achieved only through agreement.\n\nThe lower courts agreed that the\n\nNCAA\u0027s conception of amateurism is\n\nprocompetitive, but, in striking down several of","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

Ruse -- rules that do not\n\nenforce the amateur status of athletes, by\n\ncontrast, may be subject to detailed scrutiny.\n\nDecades of judicial experience show\n\nthat that distinction is both sensible and\n\nadministrable.  And the alternative is perpetual\n\nlitigation and judicial superintendence, as the\n\npast 12 years in the Ninth Circuit so vividly\n\nillustrate and portend.\n\nThank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Waxman,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"3","file_name":"National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

WAXMAN: That\u0027s right in this\n\nsense. And let me just say, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nfirst of all, look, we understand that there\u0027s\n\nbeen a trial here, and we -- we are perfectly\n\nprepared to explain, as we tried to in our\n\nbriefs, why, notwithstanding the trial, reversal\n\nis required and the antitrust laws do not permit\n\nthe Court to impose the decree that it did.\n\nBut we think that in order to avoid\n\nthe situation that we currently have, where we\n\nhave endless line-drawing and judicial\n\nsupervision, pocket -- punctuated by requests\n\nfor treble damages, it\u0027s important for the Court\n\nto speak clearly here.\n\nAnd I will say that given that we have\n\nwhat the -- what the government acknowledges is\n\na truly unique situation in which we have a\n\nproduct that is defined by the restraint on\n\ncompetition, it is perfectly appropriate and\n\nnecessary for the Court to examine in whatever\n\ndetail is necessary whether the product that\u0027s\n\nproduced really is procompetitive.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"4","file_name":"National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

None of those small schools\n\ncan do that.  They build palaces.\n\nWhat these competition restraints do\n\nis they divert the big schools\u0027 money to these\n\nother areas to compete, but it doesn\u0027t change\n\nthe competition.  And, remember, this injunction\n\ndoesn\u0027t require one school to pay anything.  It\n\nsimply said the NCAA can\u0027t prohibit it, but the\n\nconferences can.  So, for example, the Patriot\n\nLeague doesn\u0027t even allow their schools to pay\n\nathletic scholarships.

But the lower courts here,\n\nfollowing Board of Regents, correctly gave the\n\nNCAA the opportunity to show that its\n\ncompensation rules fuel consumer interest in\n\ncollege sports as a distinct product.  And the\n\ncourts ultimately upheld most of the challenged\n\nrestrictions under the rule of reason.\n\nPetitioners now seek to avoid that\n\nanalysis altogether.  They ask this Court to\n\nuphold the restraints on educational benefits\n\nonly under what they call a quick look or\n\ndeferential review.\n\nBut this Court has never upheld\n\nrestraints that have severe anticompetitive\n\neffects without traditional rule of reason\n\nanalysis, and this case, involving horizontal\n\nprice-fixing in the market for student-athlete\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"59","file_name":"National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

And -- and that\u0027s an\n\nimportant check, because Plaintiffs won\u0027t be\n\nable to show that with respect to each and every\n\nchallenged rule.\n\nAnd then the second part of the legal\n\nanalysis that I\u0027d emphasize is the step 3\n\ninquiry into a less restrictive alternative.\n\nThe lower courts here were very clear that they\n\nwere not seeking to impose marginal rule changes\n\non the NCAA. They said that this was a patently\n\nand inexplicably more restrictive set of rules\n\nthan was necessary.\n\nSo I think applying those legal\n\nstandards is not going to lead the courts\n\nrushing into trying to dismantle the NCAA\u0027s\n\nframework rule by rule.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nJustice Thomas.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Yes, thank you,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n69\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nMr. Chief Justice.\n\nGeneral, the -- I\u0027m still a bit\n\nperplexed as to how the NCAA would be able to\n\npreserve what it thinks is an important\n\ndistinction between student-athletes and\n\nprofessional athletes without constantly being\n\ninvolved in litigation.\n\nWhat\u0027s your reaction to that and","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"61","file_name":"National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.

It upheld most of the\n\nchallenged restraints.
