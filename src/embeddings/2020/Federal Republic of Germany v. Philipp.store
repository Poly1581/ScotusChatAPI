I think one of the things you see in\n\nthe Congressional Record, you see in the amicus\n\nbrief by Mr. Feldman in the Hungary case, for\n\nexample, is that it was a bit of a jungle as to\n\n-- as to how to treat expropriations from\n\ncitizens.\n\nAnd the Restatement addresses when a\n\ntaking of property from an alien violates\n\ninternational law, but it\u0027s a section about\n\ntakings from aliens.  And it\u0027s not as clearly\n\nlaid out as the genocide convention, which had\n\nbeen codified all the way back in 1948 and was\n\nwell within the -- the view of Congress.\n\nAnd the second is this specific\n\nhistoric episode had received considerable\n\ntreatment by U.S. policymakers and the\n\nexecutive, in particular, the letter from Mr.\n\nKate in 1949 that it was the policy of the\n\nexecutive, never rescinded since, to remove any\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"46","file_name":"Federal Republic of Germany v.

 Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nPetitioners\u0027 argument boils down to\n\nthis, that despite the absence of language in\n\nthe FSIA as originally passed that would limit\n\nclaims based on the

Reading a status-based new\n\ncomity abstention doctrine to avoid the FSIA\n\nwould be like telling that umpire that, even\n\nwhen the batter strikes out, the umpire can\n\nstill award first base if the batter is\n\nimportant enough or really wants to get to first\n\nbase.\n\nBut to do so would be to legislate\n\nwhere Congress has not.

My friend tries to\n\nlimit the consequences to genocide, but the\n\ngenocide -- genocide convention doesn\u0027t use the\n\nword \"takings\" or \"taken.\"  And as several\n\nmembers of the Court have noted today, slavery,\n\nsystematic racial discrimination, and other\n\nnorms, like crimes against humanity or the laws\n\nof war, can all involve takings.\n\nAlmost 700 judges, as several of you\n\nhave noted, would sit as new world courts,\n\njudging the nations of the world for alleged\n\nviolations of international human rights and the\n\nlaw of war.\n\nMuch more should be required from the\n\ntext to reach this result.  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"80","file_name":"Federal Republic of Germany v.
