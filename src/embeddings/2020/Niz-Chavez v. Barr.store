ZIMMER: Thank you very much, Mr.\n\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe statute\u0027s text and the changes\n\nCongress made in IIRIRA unambiguously establish\n\nthat a notice to appear is a specific notice\n\ndocument. As a textual matter, the government\n\nsimply cannot explain why Congress used the\n\nphrase \"a notice\" if what it really meant was\n\nsimply notice in the abstract.  Even more\n\nremarkably, though, the government all but\n\nconcedes that accepting its interpretation means\n\nthat Congress made significant changes to the\n\nstatute in IIRIRA for no reason at all.\n\nBefore IIRIRA, the statute authorized\n\nthe very two-step notice process the government\n\ndefends here.  It required an order to show\n\ncause that allowed the government to provide the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ntime and place of the hearing \"in the order to\n\nshow cause or otherwise.\"\n\nBy the time of IIRIRA, Congress had\n\ngood reasons to rethink that two-step notice\n\nprocess.  It burdened immigration courts, which\n\nwere forced to resolve disputes about whether\n\nthe government properly served the separate\n\nhearing notice, and, as this Court noted in\n\nPereira, it confused non-citizens by forcing\n\nthem to piece together information across","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Niz-Chavez v.
