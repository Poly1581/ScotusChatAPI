ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W.\n\nMcCONNELL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nMcCONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nA fundamental feature of our system of\n\nfederalism, recognized most clearly in Gregory\n\nversus Ashcroft, is that states have broad\n\nleeway in setting qualifications for their\n\nhigh-ranking officials, including their judges.\n\nDelaware has used that freedom to\n\ncreate a system unique among the states of\n\nconstitutionally-mandated political balance for\n\nits judiciary, with the result that Delaware\u0027s\n\ncourts are widely regarded as the least partisan\n\nand most professional in the nation.\n\nThe Third Circuit has upended that\n\nsystem based on an implausible reading of this\n\nCourt\u0027s political patronage cases.  Elrod and\n\nBranti expressly permit using political\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\naffiliation for appointments to high-level\n\ndiscretionary positions.\n\nBut even if we\u0027re wrong about that,\n\nthe Delaware provisions serve a compelling\n\ninterest in creating a uniquely balanced and\n\nnonpartisan judiciary.\n\nNow, to make matters worse, the Third\n\nCircuit invalidated the bare majority provision\n\nbased solely on severability, despite having\n\nfound that Mr. Adams has no standing to\n\nchallenge that requirement.\n\nThat analysis directly conflicts with\n\nboth federal and state severability doctrines.\n\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that the bare\n\nmajority requirement can stand on its own.

And Mr. Adams, who passed up\n\nthe chance to apply for a host of judgeships\n\nboth before and after changing party\n\naffiliation, lacks standing to challenge either\n\none.\n\nI look forward to your questions.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr.\n\nMcConnell, I\u0027d like to begin with the standing\n\nissue.\n\nOur cases, like Gratts and\n\nNortheastern Florida, require that a plaintiff\n\ninjured by being excluded from competing for a\n\nposition need only establish that he\u0027s ready and\n\nable to apply for it.\n\nDon\u0027t you think he\u0027s ready and able?\n\nMR. McCONNELL:  He -- he shows by his\n\nactions that he is neither -- he may be able,\n\nbut he isn\u0027t ready in that there were numerous\n\njudgeships for which he was constitutionally\n\neligible and didn\u0027t apply.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"3","file_name":"Carney v.

I think the -- the\n\nChief Justice referred to this.  He said:  I\n\nwould apply for any judicial position that I\n\nthought I was qualified for, and I believe I\u0027m\n\nqualified for any position that would come up.\n\nSo isn\u0027t he -- you know, he out and\n\nout says he wants a judicial position, isn\u0027t he?\n\nMR.

For the last 27 years, one party\n\nhas held both the governorship and the Senate in\n\nDelaware, but the courts have remained balanced\n\nand nonpartisan.  That is a remarkable\n\nachievement.\n\nWe may not be able to prove with\n\nscientific precision that Article IV, Section 3\n\nis the cause, but we don\u0027t want to risk it.\n\nStates all over the country use partisan\n\naffiliation as part of judicial selection with\n\npartisan elections and partisan appointments.\n\nDelaware should be able to use\n\npartisan affiliation to bring political balance.\n\nThank you.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"25","file_name":"Carney v.
