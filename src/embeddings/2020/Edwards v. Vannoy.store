MICHEL: Yes, Justice Thomas.\n\nI -- I think the Court has not always spoken\n\nwith one voice on that, but there are certainly\n\na number of opinions in which \"accuracy\" I think\n\nis understood just to mean factual accuracy.\n\nThe Court in Whorton, for example,\n\nwhen discussing Crawford, made the point that\n\nconfrontation could sometimes actually make --\n\nmake a -- a trial less accurate. And the Court\n\nin Butler versus McKellar, when discussing the\n\nFourth Amendment right at issue there, made the\n\nsame point.\n\nSo I think the Court has focused on\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"59","file_name":"Edwards v.
