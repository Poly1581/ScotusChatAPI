read\n\nRule 23(a)(3) as requiring typical claims and\n\ndefenses.  Mr. Ramirez\u0027s claims were not subject\n\nto any unique defenses, and they were identical\n\nto every class member\u0027s claims.  Everyone in the\n\nclass was designated a potential match with\n\nsomeone else on the OFAC list because of the\n\nsame unreasonable process, and everyone received\n\nthe same two mailings in response to requests\n\nfor their credit files.\n\nNow you object to Mr. Ramirez\u0027s\n\natypical harms or potential individual damages.\n\nBut I don\u0027t see where Rule 23(a)(3) requires\n\ntypical damages, number one, so how do you\n\nsquare your argument with the text of the rule?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n19\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBut, number two, when you raised this\n\nissue before the district court, it suggested a\n\nverdict form that would let the jury award\n\ndifferent statutory damages for class members\n\nwho experienced different harms. That seemed\n\nlike a very reasonable way to handle the\n\nsituation.  But TransUnion didn\u0027t ask for such a\n\nform.

Is that alone enough to create an\n\ninjury-in-fact under Spokeo, or do you agree\n\nthat something more needs to be shown, some risk\n\nof harm, some actual harm, something befell the\n\nplaintiff because the form of the information\n\nwas different?\n\nMS.

REAVES: Well, I think the answer\n\nis yes, I think it\u0027s closer just in that it\n\nmight, you know, touch on the concreteness just\n\na little bit, but, at the end of the day, the\n\ndenial of information alone is enough.  And we\n\nthink those cases are best read that way, and we\n\nthink what happened here is also best seen as a\n\ndenial of information, regardless of the fact\n\nthat there\u0027s not proof potentially as to\n\nindividual class members about having opened the\n\nenvelopes.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you, Ms.\n\nReaves.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A minute to\n\nwrap up, Ms. Reaves.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"54","file_name":"TransUnion LLC v.

I\n\nthink that\u0027s one of the conclusions of Lujan.\n\nIt is a -- it makes a difference whether the --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n78\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthe claim is a facial challenge to a statute or\n\nan applied application to the particular\n\nclaimant.  And, most significantly, I think it\n\nmakes a difference whether these are generalized\n\nclaims of the public at large or private claims\n\nor private endowment of the right to sue by\n\nCongress.\n\nSo I think that the -- the answer to\n\nyour question, Justice Kagan, is that Spokeo\n\nlooks at all of these in the material risk of\n\nharm in trying to determine whether there\u0027s a\n\nsufficient allegation of actual injury.\n\nI -- as we said in our brief, it may\n\nbe better to disaggregate them and to focus\n\nprimarily on whether these are private versus\n\npublic rights, because that\u0027s a simpler analytic\n\ndivide that helps explain the outcome in all of\n\nthis Court\u0027s cases.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"70","file_name":"TransUnion LLC v.

And isn\u0027t it\n\nodd to speak of publication within a company?\n\nMR. ISSACHAROFF:  Your Honor, we were\n\nin that section of the brief addressing the\n\nquestion from Spokeo whether there was a common\n\nlaw analogue to what happened here.\n\nAll we were arguing was not that this\n\nwas the basis of recovery but, rather, that the\n\ncommon law did recognize intra-corporate\n\ncommunications as a form of publication, and\n\nthat was carried forward in the Restatement\n\nFirst and Restatement Second.\n\nOur claim for recovery and for harm is\n\na statutory one, and so the question is whether\n\nCongress created the private right of action.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"71","file_name":"TransUnion LLC v.

And when Spokeo talked\n\nthen about risk of harm, it was talking about\n\nharm beyond the publication, at least as I\n\nunderstood it, for example, publication of ZIP\n\ncodes, which strikes me as a very different\n\nthing than risk -- talking about risk of harm\n\nwhen there hasn\u0027t been publication to begin\n\nwith. So that -- that\u0027s point one.\n\nAnd then, on -- on risk of harm, you\n\nheard me talk about damages versus injunctive\n\nrelief.  It strikes me that risk of harm, of\n\ncourse, is enough to get you injunctive relief.\n\nWith damages, I -- I hadn\u0027t thought risk of harm\n\nwould get you damages -- standing for damages","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"73","file_name":"TransUnion LLC v.
