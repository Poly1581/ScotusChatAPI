If a document explains the decision\n\nmade by the agency with appreciable legal\n\nconsequences, Exemption 5 does not apply.\n\nThe opinions here explain a decision\n\nmade by the Services, that EPA\u0027s proposed\n\nregulation jeopardized protected species.  And\n\nBennett holds that jeopardy decision has legal\n\nconsequence.\n\nBecause the Services\u0027 conclusions\n\ninvariably get deference, the Services\u0027 jeopardy\n\ndetermination made it very likely that EPA\u0027s\n\nregulation would be overturned unless EPA\n\nadopted additional protections.\n\nNone of that turns on whether the\n\nServices label their opinions \"draft\" or\n\n\"final.\"  Indeed, as the amicus briefs explain,\n\nthe Services almost never exercise their\n\njeopardy authority through a final jeopardy\n\nopinion.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"31","file_name":"United States Fish and Wildlife Serv. v.

keeping in mind that the burden is on\n\nthe Services here.\n\nI mean, the first is that we know the\n\nServices had a decision to make. EPA gave them\n\ntheir regulation so they could decide:  Does it\n\npass muster under the Endangered Species Act?\n\nAnd the second is that when the time\n\ncame to make that decision, under the schedule\n\nthat the agencies agreed to at Joint Appendix\n\n91, the Services conveyed the conclusion that\n\nthe regulation caused jeopardy and that the next\n\nsteps were reasonable and prudent alternatives.\n\nAnd we know that there were no further\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n42\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ndeliberations, either contemplated or that\n\noccurred, as to the viability of the proposed\n\nregulation.

Review\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And the second\n\nquestion I wanted to ask is the need for clear\n\nrules in the FOIA context. So the -- the need\n\nfor that, I think, is multi-pronged.\n\nFirst, the agency officials who are\n\nengaged in deliberations need to be able to\n\nspeak with candor, as Justice Gorsuch was just\n\nsaying.\n\nSecond, FOIA officers, who are rampant\n\nthroughout the executive branch, spend an\n\nenormous amount of time and resources on FOIA,\n\ncould use clarity.\n\nAnd then district court judges in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia and elsewhere, if you talk\n\nto, would lament the lack of clarity and clear\n\nrules in -- in FOIA cases.\n\nSo that raises the concern that the\n\neffects-based test or looking at the effects of\n\nthe memo could become so fact-intensive and\n\ncould really blur the longstanding predecisional\n\nprinciple of the deliberative process privilege\n\nbecause lots of drafts have -- have real effects\n\nwithin the executive branch.\n\nCan you respond to all that?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"55","file_name":"United States Fish and Wildlife Serv. v.

Thank you.\n\nThat\u0027s helpful.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBarrett.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, I have a\n\nquestion following up on Justice Breyer when he\n\ngave you the hierarchy of documents that might\n\nbe at stake here.  I want to be sure that I\n\nunderstand the consequences that flow from each.\n\nSo, you know, in your conversation\n\nwith Justice Breyer, you identified the\n\nbiological opinion, which is almost never\n\nissued; the draft biological opinion, which is\n\navailable by regulation; and then the draft of a\n\ndraft, which the government says this was.\n\nIs it true that the draft biological\n\nopinion, that second one in the hierarchy, is\n\nalways FOIA-able and that there\u0027s no controversy\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n63","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"57","file_name":"United States Fish and Wildlife Serv. v.
