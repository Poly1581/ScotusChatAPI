Alabama.  You\n\nknow, that -- that\u0027s pretty far afield of what\n\nwe have here. It\u0027s not even just an element\n\nproblem.\n\nIn that case, the defendant pleaded\n\nguilty without being asked a single question\n\nabout the nature -- to make sure he understood\n\nthe nature of the charges or the consequences or\n\nthe rights he was giving up.

I think the Court grappled with the same\n\nsort of problem in Neder, where Justice Scalia\n\nmade a similar argument in dissent. And what\n\nthe Court said there was, you know, we\u0027re --\n\nwe\u0027re not going to go take this \"penny in for a\n\npenny in per pound\" approach.  We\u0027re not going\n\nto categorize all element errors as structural\n\nerrors just because there might be hard cases at\n\nthe margins.\n\nAnd the last thing I\u0027d say about that\n\nis we haven\u0027t seen cases that sort of press that\n\nline to date, and I think there\u0027s good reason\n\nfor that.

obviously, in Rehaif, seven\n\njustices of this Court thought that the element\n\nwas quite important, and, in fact, it separated\n\nwrongful from innocent conduct.  And so another\n\nway to put our submission is that the defendant\n\nshould at least have the opportunity to decide\n\nfor himself whether to agree to wrongful conduct\n\nand submit to a term in prison even if it\u0027s\n\nunlikely he would satisfy that.\n\nI mean, you could take a case, Justice\n\nKavanaugh, where there\u0027s a videotape of the\n\ncrime or the defendant later wrote a book about\n\nthe crime, as Justice Alito was positing this\n\nmorning, or any number of other things, and we\n\nsimply cannot allow a system where the defendant\n\nis never given an opportunity either to\n\nunderstand the charge and agree to it or to\n\nchallenge the government\u0027s allegations at trial.\n\nOne of those two things must take place.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you,\n\nMr. Fisher.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"45","file_name":"United States v.

You know, the answer is no if you\u0027re\n\nasking do we have to satisfy the Dominguez test,\n\nbut I think the answer is yes if you\u0027re\n\nsaying -- if -- if you\u0027re just saying, you know,\n\nshould the defendant represent that he wants to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea and challenge the\n\ngovernment\u0027s case.  I mean, that\u0027s the reason\n\nwhy Mr. Gary is here.\n\nYou know, we -- there were some\n\nquestions earlier about statistics, and we\u0027ve\n\ndone our best to figure that out on our own end,\n\nand it\u0027s only, I think, fewer than 10 percent of\n\nthe defendants who were on direct review after\n\nRehaif that have made a claim like Mr. Gary\u0027s.\n\nSo it\u0027s not like every defendant is making this\n\nkind of a claim, and there\u0027s no windfall to be\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"46","file_name":"United States v.

FISHER: Thank you.\n\nI think because we\u0027ve become so\n\naccustomed to our system of guilty pleas that I\n\n-- I understand the temptation that the Court\n\nmay have to think of this case as involving a\n\nrequest for relief based on a violation of\n\nsomething of a formalistic requirement of\n\ncriminal procedure.\n\nBut, in fact, this case involves the\n\nmost fundamental of principles and the most\n\nsensitive of practices:  a conviction without a\n\ntrial. Indeed, because of the stakes involved\n\nfor individuals and the fear of government\n\nabuse, as the Court knows, the concept of a\n\nguilty plea itself was largely unknown to the\n\nframers.\n\nSo we\u0027re obviously not asking the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n53\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nCourt to second-guess the modern development of\n\nthe guilty plea system, but what we are saying\n\nis that an indispensable requirement of a\n\nconviction obtained in this matter is fair\n\nnotice of the true charge and especially of any\n\nelement like the mens rea element here that\n\nseparates wrongful conduct from innocent\n\nconduct.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"48","file_name":"United States v.
