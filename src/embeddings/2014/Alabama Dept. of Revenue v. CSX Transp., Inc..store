And so we wanted to prevent truckers from using the dyed \n\n10 diesel. \n\n11  The whole reason why we have clear diesel \n\n12 and dyed diesel to begin with is ­­ is so that we could \n\n13 support this taxing scheme where we\u0027re imposing a \n\n14 per­gallon tax on the truckers. \n\n15  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, talk about the \n\n16 water carriers. \n\n17  MR. BRASHER:  Right. \n\n18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you going to suggest \n\n19 that if they stop at a dock and eat a meal, they can\u0027t \n\n20 be charged a sales tax? \n\n21  MR. BRASHER:  Well, I think the district \n\n22 court said two things about water carriers and neither \n\n23 one makes sense, which is that the railroads didn\u0027t show \n\n24 any practical disadvantage with respect to water \n\n25 carriers because the only evidence in the record with\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n18\n\n1 respect to water carriers is that they make up 1 percent \n\n2 of the market for shipping goods from one part of \n\n3 Alabama to another. \n\n4  And ­­ and to go back to the complementary \n\n5 point that I was making earlier, the district court \n\n6 also, quite rightly, refused to simply assume that \n\n7 treating water carriers with this minor preference was \n\n8 going to harm railroad\u0027s bottom line, and this is why: \n\n9 Is that, for all we know, a perfectly reasonable \n\n10 assumption would be if our tax pretreatment for water \n\n11

the State, that CSX and every other railroad operating \n\n18 in the State would get exactly the same preference.  And \n\n19 we could be offering that preference to a single company \n\n20 that costs the State $10,000, but to offer the same \n\n21 preference to the railroads would cost $40 million. \n\n22  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why doesn\u0027t Alabama \n\n23

taxing it when someone moves goods from Alabama to some \n\n10 other State. \n\n11  And that\u0027s another reason why I think the \n\n12 water carriers are largely irrelevant, because the \n\n13

court opinion in this case which found in our favor \n\n11 applying the competitive comparison class, and like I\n\n12 said, put the comparison class to one side doing \n\n13 effectively what the court told it to do in CSX 1.  So \n\n14 the district court already addressed that and decided \n\n15 that when the State is ­­ is using tax revenue for \n\n16 general public purposes, it really is irrelevant how the \n\n17 State is raising that revenue.  We could have a yearly \n\n18 appropriation for highway maintenance and it would be \n\n19 the same thing as having a dedicated source of funding \n\n20 for highway maintenance.  And it\u0027s not as if the \n\n21 truckers are paying for all of Alabama\u0027s highway \n\n22 maintenance.  We\u0027re also taxing other people in the \n\n23 State to add money to that to build highways.  And so \n\n24 ultimately, I think the district court was right that \n\n25 that\u0027s just a red herring ­­\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n23\n\n1  JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the trucker tax is not \n\n2 directed to highways exclusively?  It goes into a \n\n3 general fund? \n\n4  MR. BRASHER:  No, the ­­ the fuel tax that \n\n5 the truckers are paying is set aside for highway \n\n6 construction, highway maintenance.  But my point is that \n\n7 it\u0027s ­­ it\u0027s not as if the truckers are the only ones \n\n8 paying for the highways to be built in Alabama; it\u0027s not \n\n9

We\u0027d have to find some funds to build highways \n\n11 regardless of how we get them. \n\n12  And also, CSX\u0027s own expert, when testifying \n\n13 in this case, agreed that railroads also benefit from \n\n14 roads, railroads also benefit from schools, and these \n\n15 are the kind of indirect benefits that the State has to \n\n16

that money that we\u0027re using, that we\u0027re collecting by \n\n17 the sales tax, goes to ­­ primarily for education, which\n\n18 is something that the railroads benefit from just like \n\n19
