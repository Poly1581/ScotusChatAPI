seen the definitions, the instruction that was given is \n\n24 similar to ones that are well­embodied in the law.  What \n\n25 you have to do is communicate a true threat, and a true\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n12\n\nOfficial\n\n1 threat is a threat that a reasonable person would \n\n2

of criminal law, is that you have to know that you are \n\n13 doing those things that are the elements of the crime. \n\n14 So you have to know that you are transmitting in \n\n15

an intent standard.\n\nAnd, you know ­­\n\n12  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Elwood, when we have \n\n13 looked at fighting words statutes, we\u0027ve never applied \n\n14 this kind of heightened intent.  As I understand \n\n15 fighting words prosecutions, that all the government has \n\n16 to show is that you\u0027ve said something that would cause a \n\n17 reasonable person to punch you in the face.  And that\u0027s \n\n18 all we ask.  So why shouldn\u0027t this be basically the same \n\n19 as that? \n\n20  MR. ELWOOD:  It\u0027s a very different \n\n21 tradition.  Fighting words ­­ I mean, traditionally \n\n22 there wasn\u0027t an inquiry.  There were some cases that \n\n23 required it, but traditionally there wasn\u0027t.  Whereas in \n\n24 here it is pretty clear that there was this traditional \n\n25 requirement, did the person have to intend to place the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n26\n\nOfficial\n\n1 person in fear. \n\n2  But here is the reason behind it, which is \n\n3 that, you know, fighting words has been essentially \n\n4 whittled down to a very, very small category of speech \n\n5 where it\u0027s you hurling epithets, nose to nose, and it \n\n6 will result in a reflect ­­ result and reflex of \n\n7 violence.  There is no time for anything but a law \n\n8 enforcement response.  The only option at that point is \n\n9 to put the cuffs on the guy before he lands ­­ lands a \n\n10 punch. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"24","file_name":"Elonis v.

 Now, I agree that this Court should decide \n\n24 what the statute means and is properly interpreted and \n\n25 what the Fourth Amendment requires, but there was no\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n43\n\nOfficial\n\n1 request for a knowledge instruction, there was no \n\n2 argument that the proper standard is knowledge let alone \n\n3 recklessness. \n\n4  JUSTICE ALITO:  My understanding of the \n\n5 Model Penal Code levels of mens rea is that there is a \n\n6 distinction, but a razor­thin distinction, between \n\n7 purpose and knowledge.  So the idea that backing off \n\n8 from purpose to knowledge is going to make very much \n\n9 practical difference, I think is fanciful.  There is a \n\n10 considerable difference between ­­ distance between \n\n11 knowledge and recklessness.  Do you agree with that or \n\n12 do I not understand that correctly. \n\n13  MR. DREEBEN:  I think you basically \n\n14 understand it correctly.  I think I would attribute a \n\n15 little bit more distinction.  Purpose is the conscious \n\n16 intent to achieve the very goal.  Knowledge under the \n\n17 Model Penal Code is acting intentionally with knowledge \n\n18 of ­­ to a practical certainty that the result will \n\n19 follow.  And then recklessness takes it down to, you are \n\n20 actually, you know, aware of the risk and you are \n\n21 indifferent to it; you act grossly negligently.  It \n\n22 doesn\u0027t have to be to the level of knowledge.  It\u0027s just \n\n23 that there is a significant risk and you disregard it. \n\n24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, yes, but \n\n25 you\u0027re dealing with some very inflammatory language.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\n1 The question is whether or not the jury is going to be \n\n2 swept away with the language as opposed to making the \n\n3 subtle determinations you\u0027ve been talking about. \n\n4  MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there are two \n\n5 protections there.  One is that the ­­ the government \n\n6 has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that \n\n7 is subject to appellate review.  And the second \n\n8 protection is that it needs to be a true threat as \n\n9 expressed in the Watts case, whether it\u0027s a good term or \n\n10 a bad term.  It means that these statements are to be \n\n11 taken seriously, that they are not in jest, they are not \n\n12 exaggeration, they are not hyperbole, they are not \n\n13 artistic expression.  And this is not a standard that\u0027s \n\n14 led to any problems ­­\n\n15  JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the third point is that \n\n16 if the first two are correct, this language is not worth \n\n17

Petitioner claims that unless the \n\n21 prevailing rule in 10 out of the 12 regional circuits is \n\n22

 The best evidence that Petitioner has come \n\n3 up with of a case that was actually prosecuted that he \n\n4 thinks shouldn\u0027t, was one in which an individual, after \n\n5
