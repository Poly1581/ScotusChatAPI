dismissal counts as a strike. \n\n17  The better view is that a dismissal does not \n\n18 count until it becomes final on appeal.  That view is \n\n19

 I want to specifically address the Federal \n\n6 government\u0027s proposed interpretation, because no one \n\n7 before this Court is defending the exact reasoning of\n\n8 either the Sixth Circuit or the Seventh Circuit.  The \n\n9 Federal government argues that the phrase \"prior \n\n10 occasion\" should be construed to mean a prior dismissal \n\n11 in a different case.  Now, that certainly addresses this \n\n12 anomaly, but we simply don\u0027t think that you can get that \n\n13 interpretation out of the phrase \"prior occasion.\"  And \n\n14 so while there may be textual ambiguity here, \n\n15 and I would certainly acknowledge as I did to \n\n16 Justice Scalia that the text of the statute does not \n\n17 unambiguously preclude respondent\u0027s interpretation, we \n\n18 do believe that it unambiguously precludes the Federal \n\n19 government’s interpretation. \n\n20  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying the \n\n21 government is being illogical or inconsistent, because \n\n22 if strike number 3 is a District Court ruling, the \n\n23 government says, well, there\u0027s no bar to your appealing \n\n24 that.  There\u0027s just a bar for filing a new District \n\n25 Court suit, and you would say that that\u0027s just illogical.\n\n15\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, we think that that is \n\n2 something that Congress could logically have done.  We\n\n3 simply don\u0027t think there is any footing in the statutory \n\n4 language for that distinction. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"14","file_name":"Coleman v.

Again, it\u0027s the problem of prisoners who are barred as a \n\n17\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 result of erroneous third strike dismissals, and there \n\n2 are such cases.  It\u0027s not a null set.  Even the Federal \n\n3 government acknowledges that there are at least two\n\n4 reported cases in which that has occurred.  And again, \n\n5 we point out that there are cases in which there have \n\n6 been modifications, and those modifications would also \n\n7 be cases where someone under the interpretations on the \n\n8

 In other words, once you set the rules for \n\n19 what constitute three strikes a prisoner ­­ when the \n\n20 prisoner has two strikes, will have an incentive to come \n\n21 in with a number of different lawsuits.  So I don\u0027t think \n\n22 that that problem really disappears under any \n\n23 interpretation.  But again, that\u0027s not a problem that \n\n24

obviously a very important practical issue for district \n\n3 courts.\n\n4  Under our interpretation, all that a \n\n5 district court, or for that matter a court of appeals, \n\n6 need do is to look to see whether in a prior case there \n\n7 has been a determination that a prisoner has three \n\n8 strikes.  If, in fact, that is so, that is the end of \n\n9 the analysis.  And indeed, our understanding is that in \n\n10 many jurisdictions, the district court clerk\u0027s offices \n\n11 actually keep lists of people who have been subject to \n\n12 the three strikes prohibition. \n\n13  There\u0027s a decision from the Western District \n\n14 of Louisiana that refers to the keeper of the three \n\n15 strikes list, and our understanding is that that is \n\n16 actually a fairly common practice.  And, of course, \n\n17 where a prisoner has not previously been subject to the \n\n18 three strikes provision, it will be relatively easy, and \n\n19 it\u0027s a familiar task for a district court to make the \n\n20 determination whether a prisoner\u0027s prior dismissals are \n\n21 final on appeal. \n\n22  Under Respondent\u0027s and the Federal \n\n23 government\u0027s interpretations by contrast, there is no \n\n24 such ease of application because a court will not be \n\n25

it please the Court: \n\n3  The plain language of Section 1915(g)\n\n4 identifies when a strike occurs.  It occurs when an \n\n5 action or appeal was dismissed.  The phrase \"action was \n\n6 dismissed\" has an everyday meaning and the ordinary \n\n7 meaning of \"action was dismissed\" does not.  Action was \n\n8 dismissed and affirmed. \n\n9  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Lindstrom, I ­­ I \n\n10 understand that argument, and it seems to me a very \n\n11 natural reading of the statute.  But the ­­ I\u0027m troubled \n\n12 by the scenario where it\u0027s dismissed and then it\u0027s \n\n13 reversed, not for these practical reasons that people \n\n14 have been talking about.  But it seems to me that if you \n\n15 were really reading the statute that way, that that \n\n16 would count as a strike, too, and that that strike would \n\n17 not go away even when it was reversed. \n\n18  And so I\u0027m wondering whether the statute is \n\n19 actually a little bit more ambiguous than ­­ than you \n\n20 are suggesting, because at the very least, I mean, \n\n21 everybody agrees that you have to make an exception for \n\n22 that case, and it seems to me that on your reading of \n\n23 the statute, that case would be included.

that he makes in pages 9 to 10 of his reply brief, is \n\n18 that sometimes Congress specifies that finality is \n\n19 required and sometimes it specifies that finality is not \n\n20 required, and so we can draw no negative inference from \n\n21 the fact that Congress was silent here. \n\n22  But if you look at the example of the \n\n23

one you\u0027re trying to appeal.\n\n5  JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn\u0027t ­­ yes, it \n\n6 does.  Because the dismissal of ­­ by the district court \n\n7 of this lawsuit after it\u0027s done is a prior occasion. \n\n8 The present occasion is your appeal of that dismissal to \n\n9 the court of appeals. \n\n10  MR. KEDEM:  Justice Breyer, it\u0027s important \n\n11 to consider the posture you\u0027re in when you\u0027re making \n\n12 that choice. \n\n13  JUSTICE BREYER:  I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s good \n\n14 policy or anything.  I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s hard for me to \n\n15 see how you can say the one and not the other. \n\n16  MR. KEDEM:  Because at the time that you\u0027re \n\n17 making the decision, a new occasion hasn\u0027t started.  You \n\n18 have to decide whether the prisoner is allowed to file \n\n19 the IFP appeal. \n\n20  JUSTICE BREYER:  Good.  And when we\u0027re in \n\n21 the second one, when you file the appeal from the first \n\n22 one, the new occasion hadn\u0027t started.  So we\u0027re still in \n\n23 the middle of the occasion. \n\n24  MR. KEDEM:  No.  Justice Breyer, the prior \n\n25 occasion has concluded.  It concluded with the issuance \n\n43\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1

 But that\u0027s not normally what happens.  What \n\n3 normally happens is what happened in this very case. \n\n4 Namely, the trial court lists the prior dismissals, plus\n\n5 what it knows about what happened to those dismissals on \n\n6 appeal, and it makes an IFP determination. \n\n7  And under either approach, the inquiry is as \n\n8 follows:  For any appellate dismissal or a trial court \n\n9 dismissal that was affirmed on appeal, you can always \n\n10 rely on that going forward.  And for any trial court \n\n11

It would lead to the odd result, as Justice \n\n25 Breyer highlighted in his colloquy with Mr. Kedem, that \n\n50\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 a prior dismissal could count as a prior occasion in \n\n2 some circumstances, but not in others. \n\n3  Let me address the question of background \n\n4 principles because that was such the focus of Mr.\n\n5 Kedem\u0027s argument.  We would respectfully submit that \n\n6 principles differ in the law whether as a matter of \n\n7 statute or whether as a matter of background principles. \n\n8 Congress can be explicit in both directions and, \n\n9 obviously, here Congress was silent.  I think in terms \n\n10 of nonstatutory background principles, frankly, the \n\n11 primary principle on which the Federal government relies \n\n12 in its brief is the principle of claim preclusion.  And \n\n13 it is certainly true that in some jurisdictions, \n\n14 consequences attach immediately upon judgment.  That\u0027s \n\n15 not the rule in others.  In California and Texas, \n\n16 consequences don\u0027t attach until the judgment becomes \n\n17 final on appeal. \n\n18  But that doctrine serves a quite different \n\n19 purpose.  The whole point of attaching consequences \n\n20 immediately is precisely to ensure that a losing party \n\n21 does not get a second bite at the apple.
