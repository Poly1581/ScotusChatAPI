shifting context is the proper analogy here.\n\nOf course \n\n19 we don\u0027t claim 330(a) is formally a fee shifting\n\n20 statute.  We\u0027re seeking payment from the estate for work \n\n21 that the code requires us to do as part of our work. \n\n22  But the fee shifting analogy is accurate for \n\n23 a couple reasons.  First of all, in the fee shifting \n\n24 statute and in the bankruptcy statute, the professional \n\n25 must file an application and have his fees approved by\n\n8\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the court.  And as in the fee­shifting regime, the \n\n2 bankruptcy professional\u0027s application is opened up to a \n\n3 wide range of objectors who are not the professional\u0027s \n\n4 client.  So all of this leads to, in both the \n\n5 fee­shifting and the bankruptcy regime, a concern that \n\n6 the professional\u0027s fees for his core work will be \n\n7 diluted by the professional being forced to defend those \n\n8 core fees. \n\n9  And, in fact, those concerns are heightened \n\n10 much more in the bankruptcy context for a few reasons, \n\n11 because in bankruptcy, the fee application is far more \n\n12 detailed and gives far more opportunity to ­­ to pick \n\n13 and ­­ and object and a far greater range of objectors \n\n14 are available, the U.S. trustee, the court itself, the \n\n15 creditors, the creditors committees.  All of those can \n\n16 come in and object that do not exist in the fee­shifting \n\n17 context. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"7","file_name":"Baker Botts, L.L.P. v.

question in two parts, because I think if Congress \n\n4 drafted the statute to say preparing the fee application \n\n5 is compensable, then we would have a very different \n\n6 case.  But it didn\u0027t say that.  It said any compensation \n\n7 awarded for preparing the fee application shall be \n\n8 awarded at this rate.  So it presupposed that preparing \n\n9 the fee application was authorized under Section \n\n10 330(a)(4) ­­ (a)(1)(A) as ASARCO even concedes on 12 ­­\n\n11 on page 12 of its brief. \n\n12  So you can\u0027t draw any negative inference \n\n13 from the fact that it\u0027s mentioned for the purpose of \n\n14 limiting it, that defending a fee application would not \n\n15 also be compensable. \n\n16  But to your second point, Your Honor, we \n\n17 agree Congress wanted to encourage people to do a \n\n18 careful job preparing the fee application.  Baker Botts \n\n19 did that here.  But that did not stop ASARCO from coming \n\n20 in and ­­ and mounting a barrage of objections that eat \n\n21 up professional fees.  So just the careful preparation \n\n22 of the application doesn\u0027t solve the question.  And \n\n23

the meaning of Section 330(a).  There is simply nothing \n\n24 in the statute that authorizes estate funds for a \n\n25

What Congress authorized under Section 330(a)(1), \n\n22 especially when read together with Section 327(a), is\n\n23 that professionals are entitled to compensation when \n\n24 they\u0027re working for the estate. \n\n25  But when ­­ when professionals have hired\n\n31\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 their own lawyers or happen to be lawyers and are \n\n2 litigating adverse to the estate, that is not ­­ they\u0027re \n\n3 not on the same team anymore.  And so under 330(a)(1) \n\n4 and 327(a), Congress has just simply not allowed \n\n5 compensation for that, which is the same as it would be \n\n6 outside of bankruptcy. \n\n7  And all we\u0027re asking for in this case is the \n\n8 same rule that generally applies outside of bankruptcy. \n\n9 Because outside of bankruptcy the American Rule controls \n\n10 and says that if you get into a fee litigation dispute \n\n11 with your client, then you pay your own way.  And so the \n\n12 same rule should apply in bankruptcy. \n\n13  And I want to address why Congress might \n\n14 have authorized compensation for preparation services \n\n15 inside the bankruptcy context when that also is not \n\n16 compensable outside of the bankruptcy context.  And that \n\n17 is because certainly in 1994, when Congress enacted \n\n18 Section (a)(6), there\u0027s a vast difference in the amount \n\n19 of time and the amount of effort that goes into putting \n\n20 together a fee application in bankruptcy and putting \n\n21 together a bill for the client. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"31","file_name":"Baker Botts, L.L.P. v.

Those statutes say that you get your reasonable \n\n18 attorney\u0027s fee incurred in an action.\n\nAnd so, fees on\n\n19 fees, when you have a dispute in that action fit within \n\n20 that express authorization by Congress, it is fees \n\n21 incurred in that action. \n\n22  So textually, that\u0027s very different from \n\n23 Section 330, but I also think it\u0027s very, very different \n\n24 when you\u0027re thinking about the purpose of those \n\n25 fee­shifting statutes.  In the fee­shifting context what\n\n45\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 you have is an award to a private party who has \n\n2 vindicated their statutory rights.

They\u0027re fighting for \n\n9 an award, they\u0027re fighting for fees on fees, and they \n\n10 both benefit by the more, you know, fees that they get. \n\n11  That\u0027s fundamentally different from Section \n\n12 330, which is a very limited authorization  that says, \n\n13 it doesn\u0027t depend on success in litigation, because \n\n14

loser has to pay the, you know, the attorney\u0027s fees for \n\n11 the winner, Congress used that in the bankruptcy code. \n\n12 For example,  in  automatic stay.  If there\u0027s \n\n13 somebody that commits a willful violation of the \n\n14 automatic stay, Congress identified that particular \n\n15 dispute and said that the loser in that particular case \n\n16 should have to pay it to the winner. \n\n17  And so if we\u0027re thinking about what rule \n\n18 makes sense, I think the government put their finger on \n\n19
