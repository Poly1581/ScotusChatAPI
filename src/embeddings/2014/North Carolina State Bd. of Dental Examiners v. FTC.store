 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN \n\n8  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER \n\n9  MR. MOOPPAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it \n\n10 please the Court: \n\n11  A State regulatory agency does not lose its \n\n12 State action antitrust immunity simply because the \n\n13 agency is run by part­time public officials who are also \n\n14 market participants in their personal capacities. \n\n15  The FTC\u0027s contrary position that the \n\n16 agency\u0027s officials must be disinterested cannot be \n\n17 reconciled with this Court\u0027s jurisprudence for three \n\n18 reasons:  First, respect for federalism requires \n\n19 deference to a State\u0027s sovereign choices concerning how \n\n20 to structure and manage its own regulatory agencies. \n\n21 Second, the regulatory conduct of public officials who \n\n22 are also market participants cannot properly be equated \n\n23 with the conduct of private businesspeople.  And third, \n\n24 the FTC\u0027s position would be massively and needlessly \n\n25 disrupted.\n\n3\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  States obtain valuable benefits from using \n\n2 market participants as part­time public officials.  They \n\n3 gain the benefits of their expertise and they gain the \n\n4

Why \n\n7 should there be an antitrust exemption for conduct that\n\n8 is not authorized by state law?  The objection here was \n\n9 that this board was issuing a whole bunch of cease and \n\n10 desist orders.  They had no authority to do that.  No \n\n11 authority at all. \n\n12  MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, two points about that, \n\n13 Your Honor.  First, it\u0027s not quite right to say that \n\n14 this board didn\u0027t have authority to issue these letters. \n\n15 It is true that the board doesn\u0027t have authority to \n\n16 issue self­executing orders akin to an injunction, but \n\n17 it is also true that the board has authority to send \n\n18 letters to prospective non­dentists saying that if you \n\n19 don\u0027t cease and desist your conduct, we will sue you. \n\n20  The only question in this case in terms of \n\n21 State law authority is whether the wording of these \n\n22 letters was somehow problematic.  No State court has \n\n23 ever determined that that is a problem, and more \n\n24 fundamentally, all of that is a question about whether \n\n25 there is a clear articulation here, and the FTC has\n\n5\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 assumed that there is a clear articulation. \n\n2  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Mooppan, can I take you \n\n3 back to Justice Alito\u0027s question, because I think you \n\n4

The danger that the Court was talking about in the \n\n18 sentence you read is the danger that the State is just \n\n19 authorizing private people to violate Federal law rather \n\n20 than having its own State policy. \n\n21  And that is what the Court meant in Hallie \n\n22 when they said there was no danger.  There is no danger \n\n23 that the State create a municipality as an elaborate \n\n24 sham to let private people violate Federal law under the \n\n25 auspices of a municipality.\n\n15\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the concern is that \n\n2 there is no State policy if the State simply says we ­­\n\n3

But \n\n10 that\u0027s not what the statute here says, and a statute \n\n11 that says do what you want wouldn\u0027t be a clearly \n\n12 articulated policy to displace competition. \n\n13  Here what the statute says is only licensed \n\n14 dentists can practice dentistry.  That is a clearly \n\n15 articulated policy to displace competition, and the only \n\n16 question is whether the State\u0027s officials have properly \n\n17 implemented that statute. \n\n18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

basically, there were two reasons.\n\nThe first is that\n\n4 scientifically, teeth whitening does not result in the \n\n5 removal of stains or accretions.  The staining material \n\n6 remains in the enamel.  It\u0027s simply bleached so that the \n\n7 discoloration is less and it\u0027s not so evident. \n\n8  The second type of evidence that complaint \n\n9 counsel offered was that, back when the statute was \n\n10 passed, the methods of removing stains and accretions \n\n11 that would have been familiar to the legislature \n\n12 involved scraping, chipping, to some extent electronic \n\n13 instruments.  It was the type of procedure that could \n\n14 not safely be done by people who lacked expertise. \n\n15  JUSTICE ALITO:

brake light rather than two brake lights.  So it doesn\u0027t \n\n19 seem that an interpretation of this statute to cover \n\n20 whitening would be completely out of the question. \n\n21  MR. STEWART:  We agree.  And as I say, the \n\n22 commission specifically declined to announce a decision \n\n23 one way or the other as to what was the correct reading \n\n24 of North Carolina law. \n\n25  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought they agreed to \n\n49\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the stipulation that this was an articulated State \n\n2

wide, wide, wide variety of mechanisms that might \n\n4 satisfy the active supervision prong in a particular\n\n5 state with respect to a particular kind of activity. \n\n6  But what you are suggesting is that that \n\n7 prong be simply removed from the analysis, that it be \n\n8 utterly irrelevant, that there is no supervision at all, \n\n9 and that\u0027s a very different and much more dramatic \n\n10 thing. \n\n11  MR. MOOPPAN:  Well, what I\u0027m suggesting is \n\n12 twofold.  First, the act of supervision is a fairly \n\n13 rigorous standard and I am sure the FTC would have told \n\n14 you that if you had asked them that question precisely. \n\n15 And I\u0027m saying that it ­­ the issue here isn\u0027t whether \n\n16 these people will be unsupervised.  The question is who \n\n17 will determine what level of supervision.  And the \n\n18 question is whether the state should decide that a lower \n\n19 level of supervision is the appropriate one, balancing \n\n20 expertise versus the risk of conflicts of interests. \n\n21 And especially when you\u0027re dealing with supervision of \n\n22 market participants.  There is a grave risk that if you \n\n23 require too much supervision as a condition of \n\n24 anti­trust immunity, no one will serve on these boards. \n\n25  Mr. Stewart said he would be leery of \n\n56\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 advocating this position if we would have a high \n\n2 deterrence effect.

the ADA and the AMA and from 23 states, all of whom \n\n4 express grave concern that if you require supervision \n\n5 market participants will not serve on these boards, and \n\n6 that is the sort of concern this Court has recognized in \n\n7 cases like Hoover v. Romlin. \n\n8  It is fundamentally up to the state to \n\n9 determine how to bear this risk.  Whether they want to \n\n10 say that the benefits of expertise outweigh the risks of \n\n11 conflicts of interest.  That is what this Court held in \n\n12 cases like Omni, that the Sherman Act is not intended to \n\n13 serve as some general rule of good government.  It is up \n\n14 to the state to determine how they want to regulate as \n\n15 sovereigns. \n\n16  The final point I would like to make is \n\n17 about Justice Alito\u0027s question about what would happen \n\n18 if the State Supreme Court tomorrow said that teeth \n\n19 whitening was the practice of dentistry.  I\u0027m not quite \n\n20 sure I understood Mr. Stewart\u0027s position but the holding \n\n21 below is that active supervision is required regardless \n\n22 of whether there is clear articulation, so I would think \n\n23 that there would be liability regardless of what \n\n24 the Court did in the future. \n\n25  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
