appeals should be reversed for three reasons:  The plain \n\n16 language of Section 1635(a); the statutory context of \n\n17 1635; and the long­standing regulatory interpretation by \n\n18

otherwise ordered by a court.\"  That sentence was added \n\n19 in 1980, 12 years after the Truth in Lending Act was \n\n20 originally promulgated.  And the reason why Congress \n\n21 added that sentence was because there had been case law \n\n22 that raised the problem that you are identifying. \n\n23  So what that sentence is intended to do is \n\n24 to give courts the flexibility to reorder the various \n\n25 provisions or slow things down so that the tender back\n\n7\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 actually happens in a way that does ­­ is not unfair to \n\n2 the lender. \n\n3  And we\u0027ve not found a single case in the \n\n4 45­year history of this Act where the borrower has \n\n5 gotten any kind of windfall.  We\u0027ve looked extremely \n\n6 hard at this. \n\n7  But notably, the reason why this precision \n\n8 happens this way, there\u0027s a rationale for it, and the \n\n9 rationale is that after the borrower has put forth all \n\n10 this money to get the loan in the first place, unless \n\n11 the borrower can get back those proceeds and have the \n\n12 security interest released, it\u0027s virtually impossible, \n\n13 or extremely difficult, to get a refinancing on the \n\n14 property. \n\n15  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose ­­ suppose \n\n16 the rescission notice is really improper.  The borrower \n\n17 had received the two copies.  And 2­1/2 years into the \n\n18 loan, it sends to the bank notice:  We\u0027re rescinding. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"6","file_name":"Jesinoski v.

 What Section 1635(f) does is it gives the\n\n21 lender the power to eliminate any uncertainty if it \n\n22 feels the need to do so in a particular case.  Before \n\n23 Section 1635(f) existed, the borrower could rescind \n\n24 basically, indefinitely.  It could pop up years later \n\n25

The lender now knows that the \n\n6 borrower has exercised the right to rescind or believes \n\n7 that it\u0027s does so validly and now there\u0027s adversity \n\n8

rescission?\n\n16  MS.\n\nGOLDENBERG:  Well, I think what\u0027s\n\n17 happened under Section 1635(b) is that courts have taken \n\n18 that last sentence of Section 1635(b) as essentially the \n\n19 power to do equity in a particular case.  I don\u0027t think \n\n20 the unwinding procedures are rescission.  I agree with \n\n21 what Mr. Frederick said, that the definition of \n\n22 rescission is the annulment, abrogation, cancellation of \n\n23 the contract. \n\n24  What follows from rescission is a common law \n\n25 restitution under this statute, the restitutionary\n\n22\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 procedures of Section 1635(b), but I think the exercise \n\n2 of the right to rescind amounts to rescission.  And \n\n3 again, I think you can get that directly out of the \n\n4 statute, and I\u0027m now looking at the same provision I was \n\n5 referring to before.  Section 1635(b) says in its first \n\n6 sentence:  \"When an obligor exercises his right to \n\n7 rescind under Subsection (a), then the security interest \n\n8 becomes void upon such a rescission.\"  So it\u0027s treating \n\n9 the exercise of the right to rescind as the rescission, \n\n10 as the thing that is canceling or unmaking the contract, \n\n11 and then what flows from that are various entitlements ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"22","file_name":"Jesinoski

become even more complicated, because the rules of the \n\n25 road under the statute are pretty clear that if within\n\n47\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 three years you\u0027ve exercised the right by sending the \n\n2 notice, that starts a process.  And sure, the bank can \n\n3 contest it, but at least you know by reading the statute \n\n4 that you\u0027ve got three years in order to exercise that \n\n5 right. \n\n6  And the reason why that right is important \n\n7 is that these disclosures can be very complicated and \n\n8 these transactions can be very complicated.  So if you \n\n9 don\u0027t get the disclosures within the three­day period of \n\n10 the closing of the loan, you can go into the loan and \n\n11

it.\n\n10  MR.\n\nFREDERICK:  And let me explain that.\n\n11 Four were required in this case.\n\nThe reason for that is\n\n12 that each person who is on the loan, each borrower was \n\n13 entitled to get two copies.  One so that they can sign \n\n14 it and send it back to the bank and the other so they \n\n15 can keep it in their file.  And there is no dispute at \n\n16 that point that everybody is operating by the same rules \n\n17 of the road. \n\n18  Why are four necessary?  Well, we know from \n\n19 the financial crisis and common sense that when two \n\n20 people are on a loan together, they might not agree when \n\n21 the rubber meets the road and the rate resets or the \n\n22 payment increases or all these other things, and they \n\n23

So that everybody knew what the rules were and \n\n5 everybody knew how to exercise them and everybody was on \n\n6 the same page. \n\n7  And so although it is ­­ to be ­­ to be \n\n8

not a surprise why, as Mr. Waxman says, they get a lot \n\n24 of these notifications.  Because they were churning out \n\n25

 Now, the last thing I want to say with \n\n5 respect to (g) is that it doesn\u0027t say exactly what he\u0027s \n\n6 saying.  There\u0027s no suit for rescission in (g).  What it \n\n7 says is that in addition to rescission, which you could \n\n8 read as an addition to the self­help remedy of the \n\n9 exercise of rescission, a Court may award. \n\n10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
