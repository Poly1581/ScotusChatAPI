the religious basis for Ms. Elauf\u0027s headscarf. \n\n7  That is not correct as a factual matter; and \n\n8 the EEOC\u0027s theory, in its brief, does not depend on any \n\n9 such assumption.

wearing a black blouse, which is against the Abercrombie\n\n4 rules.  Now, would Abercrombie fire that ­­ or would not \n\n5 hire that person on the assumption that this person \n\n6 likes black so much this person is going to wear black \n\n7 every single day? \n\n8  MR. DVORETZKY:  I don\u0027t think Abercrombie \n\n9 needs to make that assumption about what the person will \n\n10 do later in order to make a judgment based on the \n\n11 person\u0027s appearance at the interview.  If I walked into \n\n12 an Abercrombie interview wearing a suit, presumably \n\n13 Abercrombie could tell me when you come to work, please \n\n14 don\u0027t wear the suit, please wear our clothes.  But it \n\n15 would also be equally rational for Abercrombie to say, \n\n16 you know, if this person is coming in wearing a suit, \n\n17 that\u0027s not compatible with our style.  And likewise for \n\n18

headscarf, a baseball cap, a helmet or another religious \n\n22 symbol. \n\n23  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or a yarmulke.  He said \n\n24 specifically, somebody come in, applies for a job, wears \n\n25
