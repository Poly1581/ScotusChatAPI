LEWIN: We\u0027ve provided to the Court\n\n19 alternative options for resolving this issue. Our\n\n20 primary position, as I said at the outset, is that what\n\n21 is written in this statute does not amount to a formal\n\n22 recognition of sovereignty because the language of the\n\n23 statute itself is very narrow.\n\n24 It begins by saying that, for the purposes\n\n25 of, for the narrow purposes of recording a place of\n\n5\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                        \n\n       \n\n                               \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                 \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n                   \n\n   \n\n                             \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n   \n\n                            \n\nOfficial\n\n1 birth on a passport or a Consular Report of Birth\n\n2 Abroad, that is where ­­ what this statute provides for.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"3","file_name":"Zivotofsky v.

Now, suppose\n\n12 the State Department, and I think this is its position,\n\n13 says this is recognition. If we defer to the State\n\n14 Department\u0027s judgment, to the government\u0027s executive\n\n15 judgment on that point, and the government said this is\n\n16 recognition, and you say it isn\u0027t recognition, why\n\n17 doesn\u0027t the government trump? If the government ­­ if\n\n18 the Congress really wants to test its power, it can pass\n\n19 a law saying you must recognize Israel as being the\n\n20 legitimate government of Palestine, but it has not done\n\n21 that. And since it has not done that, it seems to me\n\n22 the government\u0027s argument trumps.\n\n23 MS. LEWIN: Justice Kennedy, you are\n\n24 correct.
