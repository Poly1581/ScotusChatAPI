Title VII, which was passed in 1964, and unlike the \n\n24 ADEA, which was passed in 1967, both of which included \n\n25

 MR.\n\nKELLER:  Justice Sotomayor, I believe \n\n6 you\u0027re referring to Representative Swindall\u0027s amendment.\n\n7 And the mere fact that Congress didn\u0027t enact a \n\n8 provision, this Court has not looked to in reviewing a \n\n9 statute. \n\n10  JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what ­­ you\u0027re ­­\n\n11 you\u0027re telling us that these amendments which said that \n\n12
