Justice Ginsburg, ultimately, \n\n20 we don\u0027t think that allegation is relevant here.  Now, \n\n21 it is just an allegation.  But the reason that I say \n\n22 that it\u0027s not relevant here is twofold.  One, the one \n\n23 thing we know from the Portal­to­Portal Act and the \n\n24 pre­Portal­to­Portal Act cases is the pure length of \n\n25

look at Justice Jackson\u0027s dissent, he makes crystal \n\n4 clear that the travel time at issue there was over an \n\n5 hour total, and nonetheless the clear import of \n\n6 Portal­to­Portal Act is to treat that hour as \n\n7 non­compensable time. \n\n8  The second reason why I think this waiting \n\n9 time at the exit would be particularly a bad candidate \n\n10 for treating as compensable just because it was \n\n11 relatively long is because it\u0027s not uniform 25 minutes. \n\n12 And so it\u0027s directly analogous to the time that was ­­\n\n13 people had to wait to go in and punch the clock at the \n\n14 pottery factory in Mt. Clemens. \n\n15

 The Portal­to­Portal Act generally accepted \n\n4 from mandatory compensation the activities that are \n\n5 associated with a process by which employees arrive on \n\n6

process by which they leave at the end of the day and \n\n10 get to the exits. \n\n11  We think that security screenings here are \n\n12 noncompensable because they are postliminary activities, \n\n13

employer, who knowing that there was this ingress/egress \n\n8 rule, made it part of the ingress/egress process.  So \n\n9 that\u0027s my other question repeated again. \n\n10  MR. CLEMENT:  But ­­ but even as to the \n\n11 modified hypothetical, if you have to stay on the \n\n12 employer\u0027s premises for an extra 20 minutes, that\u0027s \n\n13 closer to being engaged to wait as opposed to waiting to \n\n14 engage.  The allegations here are not that this process \n\n15 takes 25 minutes.  It can take up to 25 minutes if \n\n16 you\u0027re in the very back of the line.  And I think one of \n\n17 the many reasons not to adopt their rule is you don\u0027t \n\n18 want to create an incentive for every employee to try to \n\n19
