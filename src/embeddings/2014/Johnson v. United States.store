 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Should the Court ­­\n\n5 should the Court take into account that in the \n\n6 sentencing guidelines a possession of a short­barreled\n\n7 shotgun is ranked under career, is under the career \n\n8 offenses? \n\n9  MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, in Guideline \n\n10 Amendment 674 in 2004, which Your Honor asks about, the \n\n11 Sentencing Commission included mere possession of an \n\n12 unregistered short­barreled shotgun or possession of a \n\n13 short­barreled shotgun as a crime of violence.  But it \n\n14 did not do so after an examination of the empirical data \n\n15 or an assessment of the pool of data that gives us great \n\n16 confidence in the Sentencing Commission\u0027s decisions. \n\n17  In marked contrast, Your Honor, in 1991, \n\n18 when the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 433 \n\n19 that concluded that being a felon in possession of a \n\n20 firearm should not count as a crime of violence under \n\n21 the guidelines, it reached that conclusion after an \n\n22 extensive examination of empirical data.  The difference \n\n23 between the adoption of those two amendments highlights \n\n24 the reason that the Sentencing Commission\u0027s decision on \n\n25 this point does not deserve deference in this case.\n\n4\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  An additional consideration, Your Honor, is \n\n2 that in making that decision in 2004, the Sentencing \n\n3 Commission was not anticipating the guidance that this \n\n4 Court provided in James, Begay, Chambers, and Sykes, and \n\n5 it doesn\u0027t engage in any of the proper analysis.

 MS.\n\nMENENDEZ:  Your Honor, as many as 40,000 \n\n6 Americans have purchased these weapons legally,\n\n7 registered them lawfully and have found that they serve \n\n8 some purpose.  Whether that purpose is in hunting for a \n\n9 person of a smaller stature or home defense, the \n\n10 question before the Court is not whether there is some \n\n11 reason to have them.  Many people believe there is.  The \n\n12 question is whether merely possessing such a weapon is a \n\n13 violent felony.  And with due respect, Your Honor, I \n\n14

And, in\n\n7\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 fact, I was surprised in doing the research for this \n\n2 case that you can get these on line in States where \n\n3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many States is it \n\n6 illegal, do you remember? \n\n7  MS. MENENDEZ:  Your Honor, I believe there\u0027s \n\n8 10 States that outright ban possession regardless of \n\n9 compliance with Federal regulations.  And then in the \n\n10 remainder of the States, the question is whether, if its \n\n11 possession is legal in compliance with either State \n\n12 registrations or always in compliance with the Federal \n\n13 registrations. \n\n14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just a factual question. \n\n15 On his plea for this possession, was he charged with \n\n16 another crime? \n\n17  MS. MENENDEZ:  Yes, he was, Your Honor.  He \n\n18 was charged with a ­­ a marijuana­related crime.  And \n\n19 both of those were pleaded guilty to with Alford pleas, \n\n20 Your Honor. \n\n21  Your Honor, I think the question is how much \n\n22 speculation is permitted.  And as Your Honor correctly \n\n23 points out, it is our position that even if the \n\n24 government brought forth better data, that still \n\n25 wouldn\u0027t justify allowing mere possession to count as a\n\n8\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 crime of violence.  The reason, I think, is inherent in \n\n2 this Court\u0027s jurisprudence from James, Begay, and the \n\n3 other cases.  We have to begin this with a consideration \n\n4 of the elements.  In fact, in the James case ­­\n\n5  JUSTICE ALITO:  But you said that a \n\n6 possession offense could qualify.  So if someone \n\n7

Court to remember its decision in James.\n\nIn James, the\n\n7 Court first examined the elements of the burglary, the \n\n8 attempted burglary statute in question, and noted that \n\n9 mere possession of burglary tools was not enough to \n\n10 constitute a violation of that attempted burglary \n\n11 statute.  And in part, because an overt act toward \n\n12 entry, which presented the same sort of risk as the \n\n13 burglary itself was present, the Court found that that \n\n14 could present a risk sufficient to trigger the residual \n\n15 clause. \n\n16  This is very different.  This is much more \n\n17 like mere possession of the burglary tools, which would \n\n18 not be enough, than it is completing an additional overt \n\n19 act. \n\n20  Your Honor, the government uses the Court\u0027s \n\n21 language of ordinary case to invite this Court to engage \n\n22 in substantial speculation about someone ­­ what someone \n\n23 might do with a short­barreled shotgun.  And with due \n\n24 respect, I don\u0027t believe that was the purpose of the \n\n25 ordinary case doctrine whatsoever.  In fact, in James,\n\n12\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the ordinary case doctrine was borne not to enable \n\n2 rampant and creative speculation, but to limit rampant \n\n3

thing to say use in a crime causes enough risk of\n\n4 serious injury, but this is a step further. \n\n5  MR. BASH:  I agree that a necessary premise \n\n6 of our argument is that the ordinary case of possession \n\n7 is possession in connection with crimes.  So if you \n\n8 don\u0027t buy that, we\u0027re in trouble.  But you should buy \n\n9 that.  It\u0027s what this Court said in Heller when it said \n\n10 short­barreled shotguns are not typically used by law \n\n11 abiding citizens for lawful purposes. \n\n12  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But they are two separate \n\n13 offenses, right, possession of this gun and use of this \n\n14 gun.  And you\u0027re converting the one into the other for \n\n15 purposes of ACCA. \n\n16  MR. BASH:  And that makes total sense, and \n\n17 let me explain why.  If it wasn\u0027t like that, clause 2 of \n\n18 the definition of violent felony ­­ it\u0027s at 11a of our \n\n19 statutory appendix ­­ would do no work.  The whole point \n\n20 of that clause is to capture situations that were \n\n21 pregnant with the possibility of violence but where the \n\n22 apprehender was offended before the violence occurred. \n\n23 If an offender used a firearm against somebody, he would \n\n24 be squarely within clause 1, which is the use of force \n\n25 or the threatened or attempted use of force against\n\n31\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 somebody. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"29","file_name":"Johnson v.

So there\u0027s no convictions for \n\n7 lawful possession of a sawed­off shotgun.  The relevant \n\n8 data point is how many convictions for unlawful \n\n9

 Finally, Your Honors, I would really \n\n3 encourage the Court to consider the ­­ the rule of\n\n4 lenity and its application in this case.  The government \n\n5
