jurisdictional, that shows that Congress didn\u0027t mean for \n\n19 equitable tolling to apply.  But that\u0027s not the kind of \n\n20 argument you are making here.  You\u0027re making an argument \n\n21 that basically says in this pre­Irwin world, Congress \n\n22 understood that when it came to statutes against the \n\n23 government, they would be jurisdictional and equitable \n\n24 tolling would not apply, see the Tucker Act.  And that \n\n25

to give you more than three, the golden rule of three, \n\n6 but there are five distinctions.  I can just tick them \n\n7 off. \n\n8  One is the incorporation of the express \n\n9 language of the Tucker Act.  Two is the fact that this \n\n10 Court addressed this ­­ this particular statute, or at \n\n11 least tort claims, in the Soriano decision.  It also \n\n12

 MR.\n\nMARTINEZ:  Your Honor, I think that\u0027s \n\n8 true, that\u0027s how the equitable tolling doctrine has been\n\n9 conceived and if Congress were rewriting the statute \n\n10 today, it may well decide ­­ it could well decide that \n\n11 that would be a better approach.  But the approach that \n\n12 Congress took at the time ­­ and I think this is best \n\n13 reflected in the colloquy that\u0027s cited in page ­­ on \n\n14 page 41 of our brief ­­ Congress considered the question \n\n15 of whether in hardship cases it would be appropriate to \n\n16 give judges some discretion where there was a good \n\n17 reason for a ­­ for a claimant to file late. \n\n18  And that suggestion was raised by \n\n19 Congressman Gwynn and the Department of Justice ­­ this \n\n20 was 2 years after the Act.  The Department of Justice \n\n21 said look, it would just be impractical and it would \n\n22 create too much of a burden on the government and it \n\n23 would be impractical to have kind of a rule that was not \n\n24 hard and fast. \n\n25  And so Congress, in 1948, as that colloquy\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n23\n\n1 showed, did not think that the FTCA that had been passed \n\n2 two years earlier allowed for equitable tolling, and the \n\n3 consistent view of Congress when it rejected proposals \n\n4 to add tolling nine different times between 1946 and the \n\n5 late \u002780s was that equitable tolling should not be \n\n6

 Now, there\u0027s an historical reason for all \n\n25 that.\n\nTolling provisions or exclusions in statutes have\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n47\n\nOfficial\n\n1 always coexisted with equitable tolling, going back \n\n2 hundreds of years.  The original English Statute of \n\n3 Limitations Act of 1623 had five exclusions in it.  In fact, \n\n4 4 of the 5 exclusions in the Tucker Act came from that. \n\n5 And yet despite the fact that English statutes of \n\n6 limitations always had exclusions and they\u0027re carried \n\n7 over in colonial and ­­ and American State legislation, \n\n8 there has also been equitable tolling.  The two things \n\n9 coexist and supplement one another. \n\n10  And often, although not inherently, the \n\n11 statutory provisions operate differently than equitable \n\n12 tolling.  Equitable tolling is an individualized, a \n\n13 somewhat discretionary choice, and it requires a showing \n\n14 of hardship applicable to the individual.  The statutory \n\n15 exclusions do not.  The statutory exclusions are there \n\n16 whether the ­­ the plaintiff had a compelling problem or \n\n17 not. \n\n18  So, for example, in the Tucker Act and \n\n19 indeed in the original English statute of limitations, \n\n20 there is a carveout for people who are beyond the seas, \n\n21 and the statute of limitations doesn\u0027t begin to run as \n\n22 to them until they come back.  That exists even if \n\n23 they\u0027re just across the channel in Calais and have a \n\n24 full­time agent in London to manage their affairs. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"47","file_name":"United
