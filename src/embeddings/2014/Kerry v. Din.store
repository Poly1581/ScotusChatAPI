cut the other way, Mr. Kneedler.  You make this argument \n\n8 several times in your briefs.  But I would think that \n\n9 review would be at its nadir in the waiver authority \n\n10 because there, enormous amount of discretion is given to \n\n11 the executive official.  Whereas with respect to \n\n12 consular decisions over visas, Congress has set out \n\n13 clear rules for what those consular officials are \n\n14 supposed to be doing.  And it seems to me that the \n\n15 reason for review in that context where you\u0027re trying to \n\n16 figure out whether the consular official has, in fact, \n\n17 accorded with the congressional determination of who\u0027s \n\n18 entitled and who\u0027s not to a visa would be all the more \n\n19

 presented it today.  This Court has never said that the \n\n22  decisions of a group, a large group of officials of the \n\n23  Executive Branch are somehow immune from judicial review \n\n24
