 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We\u0027ll hear argument\n\n4 first this morning in Case 13­1019, Mach Mining, LLC v. \n\n5 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \n\n6  Mr. Goldstein. \n\n7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN \n\n8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER \n\n9  MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it \n\n10 please the Court: \n\n11  Title VII prohibits the EEOC from suing a \n\n12 private employer unless it first attempts to resolve the \n\n13 claim of discrimination through conciliation.  We ask \n\n14 the Court to hold that a court may conduct a modest \n\n15 inquiry into whether the EEOC violated that statute.  If \n\n16 it did, then the remedy generally is to require \n\n17 conciliation, not to dismiss the suit with prejudice. \n\n18  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  At ­­ at first, I thought \n\n19 this was an Overton Park case committed by law to agency \n\n20 discretion.  But then I couldn\u0027t find many cases in the \n\n21 government\u0027s brief to support that, so they have a \n\n22 different theory, and that\u0027s more their problem than \n\n23 yours. \n\n24  On the other hand, it seems to me that Judge \n\n25 Hamilton in the Seventh Circuit said it\u0027s hard to\n\n3\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 imagine more discretionary language than Congress used \n\n2 here, \"Shall endeavor to eliminate the unemployment \n\n3 practice by informal methods of conference conciliation \n\n4 and persuasion.\"  That seems to me that those are very \n\n5 difficult words for your position. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"1","file_name":"Mach Mining, LLC v.

that it is unusual.  Let me tell you how unusual it is; \n\n7 and that is, the EEOC is required to do this with \n\n8 respect to four different statutes.  The Housing and \n\n9 Urban Development Department has to do it and the \n\n10 Federal ­­ the Federal Election Commission has to do it. \n\n11 So Congress has laid this out in a series of statutes \n\n12 where it wanted to impose on the agency this special \n\n13 obligation.  Even with respect to Title VII, the private \n\n14 employee doesn\u0027t have to conciliate, the attorney \n\n15 general doesn\u0027t have to conciliate, the EEOC doesn\u0027t \n\n16 have to conciliate if it\u0027s an urgent problem under the \n\n17 statute. \n\n18  But Congress thought, and this Court has \n\n19 said many times, that it was especially important that \n\n20 the EEOC try and resolve these cases through \n\n21 conciliation.  And it would be passing strange to say \n\n22 that the entire design of the statute is that the EEOC \n\n23 will work this out through conciliation, if it possible, \n\n24

Then the Court is going to face the\n\n2 following question:  Should it announce the rudiments, \n\n3 or should it simply reverse the court of appeals? \n\n4 Because all the court of appeals said is that there is \n\n5 no judicial review after the letter.  The ordinary \n\n6 practice of the Court would be decide what the court of \n\n7
