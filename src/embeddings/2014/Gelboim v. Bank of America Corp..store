 MR.\n\nGOLDSTEIN:  Okay.\n\nMDL litigation, the \n\n25 rule is, as described in the cert papers, overwhelmingly\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\n1 in our favor, and that is the district courts enter \n\n2 judgments when they are prepared for the issue to go up \n\n3 on appeal.  The rule is, in the great majority of \n\n4 circuits, that if you do enter a judgment in an \n\n5 individual action in MDL litigation, you appeal.  And so \n\n6 district courts are perfectly aware of it. \n\n7  We call it formal as if it were a bad thing \n\n8 that we have a final judgment rule, but it is not a bad \n\n9 thing.  It is really important to have clarity. \n\n10  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I could understand, \n\n11 Mr. Goldstein, what you\u0027re saying.  Do you think that a \n\n12 judge properly considers the exact same factors whether \n\n13 it\u0027s done as the Respondents would like under Rule 54, \n\n14 or instead, whether it\u0027s done your way by staying the \n\n15 action or by holding off on a final order? \n\n16  MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The answer to that question \n\n17 is I am agnostic on it.  My point is that to the extent \n\n18 that you all ­­ that the Court agrees with Mr. Waxman\u0027s \n\n19 point, the district courts need that discretion, then \n\n20 our solution is simply to give them that discretion with \n\n21 respect to the entry of the final judgment.  It is not \n\n22 an argument against our position. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"20","file_name":"Gelboim v.

an argument against our position.\n\n23  The argument for our position that I have \n\n24 not gotten to, and I do want to make sure we don\u0027t miss \n\n25 it, is that I am required under Rule 4 of the Federal\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n23\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Rules of Appellate Procedure and Section 2107 of the \n\n2 statutes, to appeal within 30 days of the order or \n\n3 judgment that is affecting me.  At the end of the MDL, \n\n4 there is no such order or judgment.  The only thing that \n\n5 I can appeal from is the dismissal of my action.  I do \n\n6 not know, at the end of the MDL, what it is that I\u0027m \n\n7 actually appealing from.  They have ­­ the other problem \n\n8 that they have is that Rule 54(b) doesn\u0027t apply here \n\n9 because the entire act ­­ you\u0027re going to have to change \n\n10 the meaning of what an action is throughout the ­­ all \n\n11 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which is uniformly the \n\n12 single piece of litigation, the single complaint, and \n\n13 there is no reason to create confusion. \n\n14  Imagine after the ruling that Mr. Waxman \n\n15 wants, there are four cases in the district court, and \n\n16 they relate to the same sort of facts, and the district \n\n17 court dismisses one.  If you introduce this ambiguity \n\n18 about what an action is, then people are going to be \n\n19

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You raised the argument \n\n14 before us this morning that there wasn\u0027t a final\n\n15 judgment and Petitioner argues that there was under Rule \n\n16

 Well, the 58(c)(2)(b) is 150 days from the, \n\n20 quote, judgment that\u0027s reflected in 58(b), and 58(b)(1) \n\n21 in particular says, you know, entering judgment without \n\n22
