 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER \n\n9  MR. HUGHES:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, \n\n10 and may it please the Court: \n\n11  Trademark tacking is a legal fiction that \n\n12 permits an owner to modernize a mark without losing \n\n13 priority.  The proponent of tacking must demonstrate \n\n14 that the later mark does not unreasonably expand the \n\n15 legal effect of the earlier mark. \n\n16  To decide whether a change is a permissible \n\n17 modernization or an impermissible expansion, a court \n\n18 will consider the extent to which the new mark, if \n\n19 tacked, could unfairly squeeze out intervening users and \n\n20 it will examine the circumstances in which past cases \n\n21 have permitted tacking. \n\n22  In assessing the legal effects of the marks, \n\n23 the Court will consider their aural and visual \n\n24 appearance and consumer impression.  But tacking \n\n25 ultimately turns on the Court\u0027s judgment as to whether\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the legal effect of the new mark is sufficiently \n\n2 identical to that of the old mark. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"1","file_name":"Hana Financial, Inc. v.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  Well, I think it\u0027s \n\n23 important to keep separate the tacking question and the \n\n24 likelihood of confusion question.  Tacking goes to \n\n25 priority, which is sort of one element of an\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n38\n\nOfficial\n\n1 infringement suit.  Likelihood of confusion is a \n\n2 different element. \n\n3  Tacking is a constructive use doctrine \n\n4 that\u0027s about priority.  And so when juries are comparing \n\n5 two marks for the purposes of determining whether they \n\n6 should be tacked, those are a different pair of marks \n\n7 than they\u0027re comparing when they\u0027re determining whether \n\n8 there\u0027s likelihood of confusion. \n\n9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

marks should be allowed to be tacked only if they create \n\n17 the same continuing commercial impression. \n\n18  I think the word \"same\" signals the \n\n19 narrowness of the doctrine.  And certainly if a party \n\n20 were concerned that that standard tacking instruction \n\n21 were not sufficient, a party could ask for a more \n\n22 stringent type of instruction.

this case.\n\n24  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What part does the judges\n\n25 in setting the boundaries by deciding the question\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n39\n\nOfficial\n\n1 either on summary judgment or judgment as a matter of \n\n2 law, that ­­ I ­­ my thought was that a judge would not \n\n3 let ­­ that the bounds of the doctrine were decided by \n\n4 the judge when he puts the question to the jury. \n\n5  MS. HARRINGTON:  That\u0027s right.  I mean, a \n\n6 judge in these cases plays the same important roles that \n\n7 a judge plays in every civil jury trial, which is to say \n\n8 that the judge decides the legal rules and instructs the \n\n9 jury on that, and then the judge also will decide merits \n\n10 determinations if the evidence that\u0027s presented could \n\n11 only lead to one reasonable conclusion about those \n\n12 determinations. \n\n13  And so when a judge decides a tacking issue \n\n14 on summary judgment or motion to dismiss, the judge is \n\n15 setting the outer bounds of the tacking doctrine and just \n\n16 the same way it does in any other issue that comes up in \n\n17 a civil trial that would be tried to a jury.  And we \n\n18 don\u0027t discount that.  I mean, the judge plays a very \n\n19 important role.  But ultimately the question whether two \n\n20 marks give the same continuing commercial impression is \n\n21 a question that must be answered from the perspective of \n\n22 the ordinary consumer of the relevant goods.  That is \n\n23 really essentially a factual question. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"37","file_name":"Hana Financial, Inc. v.
