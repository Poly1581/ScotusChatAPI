 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That\u0027s sort of hard to \n\n2 understand because we made it very clear in Smiley and \n\n3 in Hildebrant that we\u0027re defining legislature in this \n\n4 clause as meaning legislative process. \n\n5  MR. CLEMENT:  With ­­ with all due respect, \n\n6 I disagree.  This Court heard the argument in the briefs \n\n7 in Smiley, and one side was saying just that.  The ­­\n\n8 one side was saying, oh, legislature just means the \n\n9 legislative process in the State, whatever that is.  The \n\n10 other side said, no, it means the representative body of \n\n11 the people. \n\n12  And this Court said, well, actually we don\u0027t \n\n13 have to decide that dispute, but we certainly agree that \n\n14 it means the representative body of the people, just as \n\n15 we said five years earlier in the Hawke case.  So what \n\n16 the Court said is, first, the delegee is clearly the \n\n17 legislature, the representative body of the people. \n\n18  But that brings you, then, to the second \n\n19 question, which is what kind of authority is delegated \n\n20 to the State legislatures.  And the authority that\u0027s \n\n21 granted under the Elections Clause is a lawmaking \n\n22 authority, so that means that the State legislature has \n\n23 to engage in lawmaking subject to the normal rules ­­\n\n24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I ­­ but ­­ but this \n\n25 makes no sense to me, because I think it\u0027s an either/or.\n\n5","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"3","file_name":"Arizona

these things were done by referendum or by initiative \n\n10 with the legislative process completely cut out.  So \n\n11 would all of those be unconstitutional as well? \n\n12  And we can go further.

know, you may disagree with me, but I think my position \n\n5 is consistent with what this Court said in the McPherson \n\n6 case about the authority of the State legislatures to \n\n7 prescribe rules for electorates.  They can delegate that \n\n8 to some commission and come up with it that way, but if \n\n9 they want to take the authority back, as they did in \n\n10

constitutionally compliant plan. \n\n9  And I read White v. Weiser to say that if \n\n10 there is that kind of time, then you allow the State \n\n11 legislature to do it, because it\u0027s their primary task. \n\n12  Then the second question is, if there\u0027s not \n\n13 time and then there is a judicial plan, and let\u0027s say \n\n14 the first cycle of elections takes place under the \n\n15 judicial plan.  Now, I actually read this Court\u0027s cases \n\n16 as generally suggesting, even then, there\u0027s nothing that \n\n17

 And this Court, in the Perry case, for \n\n20 example, rejected the idea that it\u0027s like you got one \n\n21 shot at this and then you\u0027re done for the whole \n\n22 decennial census. \n\n23  Now, there\u0027s at least one State, Colorado, \n\n24 that\u0027s basically said that if you get into that \n\n25 situation, then you got to live with the judicial plan\n\n26\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 until the next census; but then the legislature still \n\n2 kicks in and has the primary role. \n\n3  Now, I\u0027m inclined to think that what \n\n4 Colorado has done is inconsistent with the Elections \n\n5 Clause.  But, however you decide that issue ­­ you can \n\n6 decide it either way ­­ your position in accepting our \n\n7 argument here does not foreordain the answer to that \n\n8 question. \n\n9

that you\u0027re going to have.  So if the Election Clause \n\n13 means anything at all in terms of its delegation of this \n\n14 responsibility to the State legislatures, maybe we can \n\n15 talk about taking part of it away, but they can\u0027t take \n\n16 the entire thing away on a permanent basis and give it \n\n17 to a commission that\u0027s defining feature is that it\u0027s not \n\n18 representative. \n\n19

 But if the Court were to reach the merits, I \n\n22 want to make a couple of points on the statutory\n\n23 Section 2a(c) issue; and the first is I think the \n\n24

your question on, I think the operation of the prefatory \n\n12 clause here is best understood in context. \n\n13  A neighboring Federal statute, 2 U.S.C. 2c \n\n14

 And that\u0027s the question that Section 2a(c)\n\n20 answers.  Section 2a(c) says one of these default \n\n21 procedures that we prescribed is going to apply until a \n\n22 State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law \n\n23 thereof. \n\n24  I think the necessary and logical corollary \n\n25 of that is that once the State is redistricted in the\n\n33\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 manner divided by the law thereof, those are the \n\n2 districts that are going to be used.

of Hildebrant, that is exactly what they would have \n\n6 expected. \n\n7  Hildebrant, in construing the nearly \n\n8 identical language of the 1911 Act, said, first of all, \n\n9 that the statutory language had the express purpose to \n\n10 provide the direct democracy features ­­\n\n11  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I had the same thought \n\n12 as the Chief Justice.  It would be one thing if Congress \n\n13 passed a law that said a State may apportion \n\n14 congressional districts in any manner consistent with \n\n15 the law of this State.  But that\u0027s not what this ­­\n\n16 that\u0027s not what this statute says. \n\n17  Now, this statute may have been enacted on \n\n18 the assumption that that would be constitutional but \n\n19

come at it a slightly different way, which is, my friend \n\n19 just said that if the State legislature wanted to, the\n\n20 State legislature could have given this power to the \n\n21 commission.  Now, under the second subclause of the \n\n22 Elections Clause, Congress can do anything that a State \n\n23 legislature can do, which means Congress could also give \n\n24 this power to the commission. \n\n25  The only difference between my friend\u0027s\n\n36\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 scenario and mine is that in my friend\u0027s scenario, the \n\n2 State legislature would retain the authority to override \n\n3 what the commission had done, but that\u0027s always the \n\n4 consequence of congressional legislation versus State \n\n5 legislation.  When Congress passes a law of the sort \n\n6 that it’s allowed to pass under the second subclause of \n\n7 the Elections Clause, it\u0027s not something that a State \n\n8 legislature can override and it\u0027s simply a consequence \n\n9 of Congress\u0027s superseding authority and congruent \n\n10

used to revise the first clause?  That\u0027s what we\u0027re \n\n14 talking about here.  The second clause can certainly ­­\n\n15 Congress can do something on its own, but can Congress \n\n16

the predecessor to Section 2a(c) was simply doing \n\n22 something that the Constitution expressly gave the right \n\n23 to do.  And I don\u0027t think the right way to think about \n\n24
