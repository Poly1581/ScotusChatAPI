first the issue of amendment.  The ­­ the ­­ to be \n\n2 talking about this as leave ­­ the question is what is a \n\n3 proceeding, not what is a contested matter.  And \n\n4 everybody agrees that you can have proceedings that are \n\n5 smaller than the bankruptcy case and the question is \n\n6 whether this is one of them or not. \n\n7  Now the fact that the court granted leave to \n\n8 amend is really equivalent in the norm or similar in a \n\n9 normal civil case, to a court denying without prejudice. \n\n10 It means, yes, debtor, you can come back with another \n\n11 plan.  You are permitted to do that. \n\n12  That starts a new proceeding.  The ­­ At that \n\n13 point the debtor files the plan, the creditor objects, you \n\n14 have whatever litigation you need over that plan.  The \n\n15 judge holds a hearing just like he held the hearing \n\n16 before, and ultimately the judge decides whether to \n\n17 grant or deny confirmation.  And that is ­­ that looks \n\n18 like a proceeding.  It has a beginning and a middle and \n\n19

capable of making his monthly mortgage payment according \n\n2 to the terms of his mortgage. \n\n3  There are certain other unsecured creditors. \n\n4 And the debtor says, and I\u0027m able to pay monthly $155 on \n\n5 those two.  On a ­­ and then there are other creditors \n\n6 who failed to file proofs of claim.  Those creditors \n\n7 which are in the tens of thousands of dollars, they\u0027re \n\n8 going to go away if a plan is confirmed, any plan is \n\n9 confirmed. \n\n10  So what this debtor could have done is say, \n\n11 okay, I\u0027m going to keep making the same monthly payments \n\n12 just as I proposed, just as I should under my mortgage, \n\n13 but I\u0027m not going to get to cram down to the bank.  I\u0027m \n\n14 not going to get to force them to take a haircut.  I\u0027m \n\n15 still going to get to pay off in a very regular way my \n\n16 other unsecured creditors $155 a month, that will be \n\n17 done in I think we calculated about 20 months.  That is \n\n18 definitely a preferred plan than anything else, again, \n\n19 because those creditors who failed to file proofs of \n\n20 claim, they\u0027re gone.  Tens of thousands of dollars of \n\n21

was ultimately rejected by the Court in Ransom.  That \n\n16 issue could have been taken up on immediate appeal. \n\n17  The second time they amended it was because \n\n18 the bank had objected that when they listed the payments \n\n19 that would be made on the mortgage, they only gave the \n\n20 principal and interest.  They weren\u0027t going to pay the \n\n21 insurance or the taxes to escrow.  That could have been \n\n22 taken all the way up. \n\n23  And then we had the question of the hybrid \n\n24 plan.

 And, again, there can be a defensive reason \n\n5 for taking an appeal because the ­­ the debtor wants to \n\n6 stay in the house to prevent foreclosure, or it could be \n\n7
