It made both of those crimes \n\n10  eligible for the death penalty at the discretion of the \n\n11  jury.  And if you look at the broader code at that time, \n\n12

 tells us is that in every bank robbery, there is going \n\n16  to be danger presented to everyone present.\n\nAnd under\n\n17  Section (d), Congress used danger as the jumping off \n\n18  point for an aggravated offense under Section (d).  It \n\n19  escalated the statutory maximum in cases where the \n\n20  robber used a gun or a knife to put someone\u0027s life in \n\n21  danger.  So I think the dangerousness by itself doesn\u0027t \n\n22  get us to an (e) offense. \n\n23  And also ­­ so  one more thing before I \n\n24

 amount that a bank robber receives ­­ that a first­time \n\n5  offender like Mr. Whitfield receives for a bank robbery \n\n6  offense.  That factors in his post­robbery conduct \n\n7  during his flight and gives him adequate punishment for \n\n8  that.  So the (e) charge is unnecessary to ensure that \n\n9  he receives the punishment he needs. \n\n10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 MR.\n\nFLETCHER:  I don\u0027t think so.\n\nI don\u0027t \n\n3  think this Court has ever suggested that the charging\n\n4  decisions with respect to a particular statute should \n\n5  inform the way the statute is interpreted. \n\n6  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you think that concern \n\n7  is simply irrelevant to the interpretative task that we \n\n8  face. \n\n9  MR. FLETCHER:  I think the Court has said \n\n10  that the interpretative task in interpreting a statute \n\n11  is to give the words of the statute their ordinary \n\n12  meaning in the context in which they\u0027re enacted.  I \n\n13  don\u0027t think that is considered ­­ a charge of questions \n\n14  is ­­ of charging discretion would play into that \n\n15  inquiry. \n\n16  I understand why such a hypothetical pattern \n\n17  of prosecutorial abuse would give the Court pause and \n\n18  would be of concern, and I think that\u0027s why it\u0027s \n\n19  significant that to the extent that those concerns do \n\n20  arise, we don\u0027t have evidence of that here in the \n\n21  circuits that have adopted our rule or something very \n\n22  much like it.  And I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any indication \n\n23  that prosecutors are departing from the instruction to \n\n24  consider the circumstances of individual cases in \n\n25  bringing charges. \n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n53\n\n1  If the Court has no further questions, we\u0027d \n\n2  ask that the judgment below be affirmed. \n\n3

 It\u0027s important to point out that in his \n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n55\n\n1  presentation today, my friend mentioned that well, the \n\n2  guidelines ­­ the guidelines charging manual doesn\u0027t \n\n3  actually provide a limit here because abduction means\n\n4  even movement of a single step.  So we know that the \n\n5  government isn\u0027t disavowing the single­step rule.  It \n\n6  continues to advance it before this Court. \n\n7  And the government has also pointed to \n\n8  problems with line drawing.  There\u0027s no doubt that it is \n\n9  not easy to draw a line in a case like this.  But that \n\n10  doesn\u0027t justify the Court or the government in throwing \n\n11  up its hands and saying there\u0027s no line at all.  I would \n\n12  say that the rule of lenity should have special force in \n\n13  the context of mandatory minimum provisions like this \n\n14  one, both because of the notice that a criminal \n\n15  defendant should receive that his conduct is so severe, \n\n16  that he\u0027s going to face the mandatory minimum penalty as \n\n17  severe as this one, and because of the harm to the \n\n18  system that flows from a broadly applicable mandatory \n\n19  minimum that gives the prosecution the ability to \n\n20  threaten these charges in otherwise ordinary bank \n\n21  robbery cases. \n\n22  If there are no further questions, we\u0027d ask \n\n23  the Court to reverse the (e) conviction and send this \n\n24  case back for resentencing. \n\n25  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
