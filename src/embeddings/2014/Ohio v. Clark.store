social worker and the police the next day. \n\n12  The teachers asked the questions very close \n\n13 in time to when the injuries occurred.  It was within \n\n14 hours.  They also asked very open­ended questions. \n\n15 There were only two real questions:  Who did this?  And \n\n16 what happened?  These are all factors you can look to to \n\n17

 The Ohio Supreme Court did err by viewing \n\n8 the teachers here as equivalent to police.  And if I \n\n9 could turn first to Justice Sotomayor\u0027s concern there, I \n\n10 think that it is significant that these were teachers \n\n11 and not police officers; teachers who were not acting as \n\n12 surrogates for police, but in their normal, ordinary \n\n13 role as care providers for this child. \n\n14  Teachers aren\u0027t in the business of \n\n15 prosecution.  They\u0027re not in the business of collecting \n\n16 evidence, and as such, this Court can generally presume \n\n17 that when they inquire of their students as to how they \n\n18 got hurt, they are asking out of a concern for welfare, \n\n19 safety, and out of their normal, routine role, not as a \n\n20 means of collecting evidence. \n\n21  It\u0027s also significant that when you take \n\n22 away, you strip away that view of the teachers as \n\n23 equivalent to police, the conversation viewed through \n\n24 that lens takes on a very different character.  Instead \n\n25

you asked about the social ­­ the relationship between \n\n14 social services and the police.  Ohio law quite \n\n15 explicitly and unambiguously requires the social \n\n16 services agency to share information of any possible \n\n17 abuse, criminal abuse with the police, and also the \n\n18 Cuyahoga County\u0027s own guidelines which we cite in our \n\n19 briefs.  So there\u0027s no doubt those two things are \n\n20 intertwined. \n\n21  And secondly, the independent ­­ the \n\n22 mandatory reporter statute along with Ohio Rule 807 \n\n23 expressly make these statements admissible in criminal \n\n24 court proceedings.  So you put all this together and \n\n25

conditioning admissibility on some fact at the time of \n\n9 trial, which is still further evidence that what Ohio is \n\n10 doing is gathering up these statements to use them as a \n\n11

Confrontation Clause swallow up the 30 exceptions to the \n\n13 hearsay rule, and therefore you have to draw lines. \n\n14 This case is tangential.  This case involves tragedy \n\n15 either way.  It\u0027s a tragedy to abuse children.  It\u0027s a \n\n16 tragedy to put the wrong person in jail on the basis of \n\n17 unreliable testimony. \n\n18  Now, with that kind of tragedy, it seems \n\n19 tailor­made for the Due Process Clause, allowing States \n\n20 to experiment, allowing the bar to work out some of the \n\n21 things you say.  What\u0027s at issue here to me, is the \n\n22

 One key point of disagreement I have with my \n\n21 colleague is the issue of Ohio law.  And specifically, \n\n22 Ohio law does not impose upon any mandatory reporter a \n\n23 duty to investigate.  And if it did, I think that would \n\n24 be a fundamentally different analysis.  Because the \n\n25 kinds of abuses this Court has told us the Confrontation\n\n51\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Clause was designed to address, are government abuses. \n\n2
