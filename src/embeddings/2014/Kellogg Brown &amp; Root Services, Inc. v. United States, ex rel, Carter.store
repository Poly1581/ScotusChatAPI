under your view, the government doesn\u0027t get the \n\n15 suspension? \n\n16  MR. ELWOOD:  That\u0027s right.  It doesn\u0027t get \n\n17 the wartime suspension.  It would, however, get the \n\n18 specific three­year tolling provision, or three­year \n\n19 discovery period, under the False Claims Act itself. \n\n20  And a couple other notes that I think are \n\n21 worthwhile.  I mean, we\u0027ve already said a lot about the \n\n22 fact that the Solicitor General said in 1959, at a time \n\n23 when it had been litigating these cases continuously, \n\n24 that it was subject to criminal laws only.  But I think \n\n25 it\u0027s also significant that the officer created by the\n\n10\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Settlement Contract Act, or the Office of Contract \n\n2 Settlements, said in 1947 that this tolling provision \n\n3 only applied to crimes.  And I think that\u0027s significant \n\n4 because, I mean, it was within ­­ I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s a \n\n5 Chevron deference thing, but it was within their duty. \n\n6 As the government points out, they had to investigate \n\n7 and report it to the government to do what they will \n\n8 with it.  But the end result of it was that you have to \n\n9 know whether that\u0027s subject to tolling or not when \n\n10 you\u0027re deciding how to prioritize what you\u0027re going to \n\n11 be investigating and reporting. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"9","file_name":"Kellogg Brown \u0026amp; Root

And in 1942, all that the statute did was extend until \n\n21 1945 the provision that was in in 1942.  It also did not \n\n22 refer to the wars.  The first statute that actually \n\n23

current version of the WSLA does cover crimes.  It tolls \n\n21 the limitations period for criminal prosecutions, but it \n\n22 also applies to civil offenses. \n\n23  That ­­ the next thing I would ask the Court \n\n24 to look at is on page 1A of the government\u0027s brief. \n\n25 We\u0027ve reproduced the original 1942 version of the\n\n50\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act. \n\n2  And the provision begins:  \"The running of \n\n3 any existing statute of limitations applicable to \n\n4 offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud \n\n5 the United States or any agency thereof, whether by a \n\n6 conspiracy or not, and in any manner, and now indictable \n\n7 under any existing statutes.\" \n\n8

the phrase \"now indictable.\" \n\n12  Now, it\u0027s possible that the phrase \"now \n\n13 indictable\" did other work as well; but it was the only \n\n14 language in the statute that limited the provision to \n\n15 crimes. \n\n16  And so part ­­ part of the questioning by \n\n17 the Court, understandably, has been to the effect of, if \n\n18 Congress meant to change this in 1944, why didn\u0027t it do \n\n19 something more direct to manifest that intent? \n\n20
