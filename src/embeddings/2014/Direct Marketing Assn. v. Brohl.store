 MR.\n\nISAACSON:  I think two responses,\n\n5 Justice Kagan.  One, the terms \"collection,\" \n\n6 \"assessment,\" \"levy,\" and \"collection\" are terms of art \n\n7 that have particular relevance in tax parlance, just as \n\n8 the terms \"enjoin,\" \"suspend\" have particular relevance \n\n9 in regard to the Court\u0027s equity powers. \n\n10  So in this situation, what collection is \n\n11 referring to, and it\u0027s consistent with how the Internal \n\n12 Revenue Code treats the term \"collection,\" it\u0027s the \n\n13 action that is taken by tax authorities, by government \n\n14 officials, after a determination of tax liability has \n\n15 been made, after notice has been given to the taxpayer \n\n16 of their obligation, and it\u0027s the efforts of the \n\n17 government to then recover the amount of money which is \n\n18 owed. \n\n19  The fact that there may be information which \n\n20 is of use, of relevance that may precede the collection \n\n21 activity of the government doesn\u0027t convert those \n\n22 preliminary activities into collection itself.  So I \n\n23

Well, Congress wrote a \n\n22  statute with terms that seem most naturally read to have \n\n23  a technical meaning, restrain, suspend, enjoin, assess, \n\n24  levy, and collect.

 Let me come back to Justice Kagan\u0027s pizza \n\n3  example.  So her clerks are collecting money for pizza \n\n4  to be had at night and let\u0027s say the Chief Justice says \n\n5  this is fine, but you ­­ you may not use court e­mail to \n\n6  try to collect this.  Now, would you say that the Chief \n\n7  Justice has restrained, suspended or enjoined the \n\n8  collection of the pizza money?  You might say he\u0027s made \n\n9  it a little bit harder, maybe he\u0027s interfered with it. \n\n10  But would ­­ would anybody naturally use those technical \n\n11  terms. \n\n12  MR. DOMENICO:  Well, in the pizza context, I \n\n13  think it would be unlikely to use those technical terms. \n\n14  But I think in ­­ in the tax context, if someone told \n\n15  the Department of Revenue you may not assess or collect \n\n16  these taxes, I would be very nervous about advising them \n\n17

 what is your best argument for why Hibbs doesn\u0027t\n\n12  control?  Hibbs says this statute is about stopping \n\n13  taxpayers from avoiding the obligation to paying the \n\n14  government, and here we have a third party not a \n\n15  taxpayer. \n\n16  MR. DOMENICO:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I \n\n17  think what Hibbs was about was that that case did not \n\n18  interfere with the collection ­­ the State\u0027s revenue \n\n19  collection mechanisms.  The text of the Act, as this \n\n20  Court recognized, Justice Alito pointed out, the text of \n\n21  the Act on this point is identical essentially to the \n\n22  AIA.  The Court in Americans United flatly rejected the \n\n23  argument that the AIA only applied to taxpayers and it \n\n24  would ­­ it would be contrary to the history of the Act \n\n25  as well and how this Court has applied it and how the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\n1  lower courts have applied it. \n\n2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I\u0027m not quite sure \n\n3  that you\u0027re addressing the essence of Hibbs.  Hibbs \n\n4  defined the terms \"collection,\" \"assessment,\" et cetera \n\n5  very narrowly.  Much more narrowly than you are right \n\n6  now.  The difference that Justice Breyer was pointing to \n\n7  is the important one.  You haven\u0027t answered how you can \n\n8  get to where you\u0027re going unless we disavow the narrow \n\n9  definitional reading that Hibbs gave to those three \n\n10  issues. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"38","file_name":"Direct Marketing Assn. v.
