there\u0027s no way to know, unless you have this frequent, \n\n22 unannounced inspection, that someone is missing.  So \n\n23 there\u0027s a real necessity here as there was in Burger and \n\n24

Then what you are doing is if you \n\n17 have to make an honest assessment of whether this \n\n18 information really does further the Fourth Amendment \n\n19 value of privacy.  And it does because this has private \n\n20 stuff in it.  There\u0027s just no real dispute about that. \n\n21  And I am sympathetic, Justice Kennedy, to \n\n22 the fact that innkeepers have been regulated for a long \n\n23 time.  I will simply say that in 99.4 percent of the \n\n24 jurisdictions in this country, this is not the rule. \n\n25

tell us about whether our records are private?  And \n\n7 certainly, we can identify a huge array of other \n\n8 businesses that are regulated. \n\n9  The one data point that I wanted to make is \n\n10 that in 2002, the Department of Justice did a study, and \n\n11 it found that 335 different provisions of Federal law \n\n12
