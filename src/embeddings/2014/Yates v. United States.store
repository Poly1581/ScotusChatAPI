 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER \n\n9  MR. BADALAMENTI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may \n\n10 it please the Court: \n\n11  The natural, sensible and contextual reading \n\n12 of Section 1519 is that the phrase \"record document or \n\n13 tangible object\" is confined to records, documents and \n\n14 devices designed to preserve information, the very \n\n15 matters involved in the Enron debacle.  Given the \n\n16 expansive Federal nexus of this statute, which is the \n\n17 intent to influence the proper administration of any \n\n18 matter within the jurisdiction of the United States, it \n\n19 is implausible that Congress would have passed sub \n\n20 silentio, an all­encompassing obstruction statute buried \n\n21 within the altering documents provision of the \n\n22 Sarbanes­Oxley Act. \n\n23  A strong textual indicator that Section 1519 \n\n24 is confined to record­related offenses is the inclusion \n\n25 of the unique term \"makes false entry in,\" which\n\n3\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Congress only uses in record­related statutes.  The \n\n2 canons of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis confirm \n\n3 that tangible object is related to the common thread \n\n4 between record and document which are information \n\n5

 MR.\n\nMARTINEZ:  Your Honor, I think a couple \n\n19 points on that.\n\nFirst of all, Congress passed a broad\n\n20 statute.  The statute as originally drafted and reported \n\n21 out of the Senate Judiciary Committee had a 5­year \n\n22 penalty.  Congress looked very closely at that penalty. \n\n23 It was ­­ sorry, it was drafted with 5 years.  It was \n\n24 reported out of committee with 10 years, and it was \n\n25 ultimately at ­­ at the suggestion of the House of\n\n27\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Representatives, upped to 20 years. \n\n2  JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I\u0027m not talking about \n\n3 Congress.  I\u0027m talking about the prosecutor.  What kind \n\n4 of a mad prosecutor would try to send this guy up for \n\n5 20 years or risk sending him up for 20 years? \n\n6  MR. MARTINEZ:  Your Honor, we did not ask \n\n7 for 20 years in this prosecution.  And let me try to \n\n8 explain ­­\n\n9  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you did ­­ you did ­­\n\n10 you did charge ­­\n\n11  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What did you ask for? \n\n12  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You charged two offenses: \n\n13 2232, and Yates is not questioning the applicability of \n\n14 that.  Is there any guidance that comes from Justice to \n\n15 prosecutors?  I mean, the code is filled with \n\n16 overlapping offenses.  So here\u0027s a case where the one \n\n17 statute has a 5­year maximum, the other 20.  The one \n\n18 that has the 5­year clearly covers the situation. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"26","file_name":"Yates v.

Penal Code did identify this as a misdemeanor.  The \n\n10 Brown Commission, which built on the Model Penal Code, \n\n11 treated it as a misdemeanor or as a felony, depending on \n\n12 the severity of the underlying offense. \n\n13  When Congress sat down in the \u002770s and \u002780s \n\n14 and was trying to incorporate, essentially, that \n\n15 provision into Federal law unsuccessfully, over a dozen \n\n16 times it treated it as a felony.  And then, or course, \n\n17 Congress in Sarbanes­Oxley Act in both 1512(c)(1) and in \n\n18 1519 also treated it as a felony with a 20­year penalty. \n\n19 And ­­ and with respect to that penalty, again, I think \n\n20 it\u0027s important to emphasize that the text that\u0027s at \n\n21

And there\u0027s no reason to think that when \n\n25 Congress tinkered with that penalty, it meant to kind\n\n45\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1
