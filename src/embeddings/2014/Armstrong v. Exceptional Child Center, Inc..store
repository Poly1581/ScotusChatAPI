So if these doctors or providers wanted to charge more, \n\n23 they would be in violation of State law and would have\n\n24 an enforcement action against them.  So, I mean, I \n\n25

providers are charging patients more than the State \n\n6 allows.  The way that it works in Idaho, particularly \n\n7 with respect to this waiver program, is that the \n\n8 providers provide the service to the beneficiary, the \n\n9 providers then bill the State, and the State reimburses \n\n10 them.  And both under Federal regulations and State \n\n11 regulations, the providers come into the program and \n\n12 agree to take as payment in full the amount ­­ the \n\n13 lesser of the amount of their customary charges or the \n\n14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I still don\u0027t \n\n6 understand why, as Justice Kagan pointed, that isn\u0027t\n\n7 just an argument on merit.  If we go back to your very \n\n8

 In this case, we had the unusual \n\n14 circumstance that the State of Idaho had directly \n\n15 flouted what it told the Federal agency it was going to \n\n16 do.

No, I don\u0027t agree with that. \n\n8 We ­­ we followed the methods and procedures that had \n\n9 been in place.  And methods and procedures can be \n\n10 different and still produce the same rates.  Rates are \n\n11 divorced from methods and procedures.  And so, we never \n\n12 violated any of the methods and procedures.  And again, \n\n13
