the PDA advances that interest in a narrow but important\n\n2 way.  I say the second clause is narrow because it is \n\n3 not a freestanding accommodation requirement like the \n\n4 religious provision of Title VII or like the ADA.  And I \n\n5 say it is narrow because there\u0027s only one thing that an \n\n6 employer can\u0027t do when it affords benefits or \n\n7 accommodations.  It can\u0027t draw distinctions that treat \n\n8 pregnancy­related medical conditions worse than other \n\n9 conditions with comparable effects on ability to work. \n\n10  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That wasn\u0027t the position \n\n11 that the government took in the U.S. Postal Service \n\n12 policy.  We are told that the government defended a \n\n13 policy that is, for all intents and purposes, the same \n\n14 as United Parcel Service.  And more than that, some \n\n15 briefs called Petitioner\u0027s position frivolous, \n\n16 contrived.  That was the government\u0027s position.  So will \n\n17 you explain how the government ­­ I suppose to this day, \n\n18 because the Postal Service still retains, as far as we \n\n19 know, the exclusion of pregnant women. \n\n20  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Of course, Justice \n\n21 Ginsburg.  It is correct that the Department of Justice \n\n22 defended the Postal Service practices against charges \n\n23 like those that Ms. Young makes in this case.  That\u0027s \n\n24 correct.  We acknowledge that in footnote 2 of our brief \n\n25

there are classes and some get the benefits equivalent\n\n23 to the pregnancy and some don\u0027t. \n\n24  And how are we supposed to tell which are \n\n25 the criteria that are consistent with the statute and\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n26\n\nOfficial\n\n1 which are not?  That\u0027s what I found as the difficult \n\n2 question in the case.  And that\u0027s why I ask it using the \n\n3 idiosyncratic, simply to illustrate what I think is the \n\n4 problem. \n\n5  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, of course.  Let me \n\n6 get to the second point I wanted to make in response to \n\n7 your question, and then I\u0027ll try, after I do that, to \n\n8 give you a very specific response to what you just asked \n\n9 me. \n\n10

If an employer is discriminating against \n\n14 women in promotions, the fact that an employer is also \n\n15 discriminating against overweight men in promotions \n\n16 doesn\u0027t make the discrimination against women any less \n\n17 actionable because it just reflects the choice Congress \n\n18 made about whom to protect and whom not to protect.  And \n\n19 here, the choice Congress made on whom to protect and \n\n20 whom not to protect is the choice to protect women who \n\n21

job, that distinction goes to ­­ inevitably goes to the \n\n12 source of the impairment.  And, of course, pregnancy \n\n13 will never qualify under that standard.  But this case \n\n14 is not just about on the job versus off the job.  It\u0027s \n\n15 about on the job versus off the job plus the DOT \n\n16 certification category, which can include people who \n\n17

include lifting.  And the DOT manual, which the \n\n21 Petitioner cites at pages 6 and 7, says exactly that. \n\n22  Thank you. \n\n23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General. \n\n24

applied, which was to provide accommodations to \n\n7 employees who are injured on the job but not to provide \n\n8 accommodations to any employees who sustained a \n\n9

attempted to bring one late in the day.  It was \n\n13 dismissed by the district court because it had not been \n\n14 exhausted. \n\n15  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Halligan, could we \n\n16

The reading that we propose is very straightforward. \n\n24 What Congress said in the second clause, the key words \n\n25 are \"the same as other persons.\"

\u002779 guidelines, the \u002779\n\n2  guidelines simply mimic the language of the statute.  In \n\n3  2012 the EEOC, in its strategic plan, said that it was \n\n4  looking at addressing the very issue that it opined on \n\n5  in the 2014 guidance as emerging.  If the 1979 \n\n6  guidelines stood for what Petitioner suggests, there \n\n7  would have been no need to treat it as emerging.  It \n\n8  would have been settled 30 years ago. \n\n9  Finally, I want to point out that this is an \n\n10  area where the democratic process is working as it \n\n11  should and as this Court instructed it should in Cal \n\n12  Fed.  In Cal Fed, this Court looked at the question of \n\n13  whether or not state statutes which provided \n\n14  preferential treatment to pregnant employees, the \n\n15  statute there provided extra leave and reinstatement \n\n16  rights to pregnant employees, was preempted by the PDA. \n\n17  The Court said the PDA sets a floor.  That floor is that \n\n18  you can\u0027t single out pregnancy for adverse treatment. \n\n19  States can go beyond that as additional and new \n\n20  challenges are identified. \n\n21  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Halligan, for the \n\n22  democratic process to work as it should, the PDA has to \n\n23  be given a fair reading.  And what we know about the PDA \n\n24  is that it was supposed to be about removing stereotypes \n\n25
