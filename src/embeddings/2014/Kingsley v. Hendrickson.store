the use of excessive force?  I think that\u0027s how the \n\n4 district court treated it. \n\n5  MS. WARD:  The ­­ the safety of the detainee \n\n6 was the stated objective for the use of the force in ­­\n\n7 in this case.  And that is a legitimate interest, but \n\n8 the determination of whether the ­­ the force itself was \n\n9 excessive is based on the Bell test for legitimate \n\n10 purpose, legitimate penological objectives.  So then the \n\n11 test is objectively, then, whether or not the use of \n\n12 force was excessive to the state ­­ stated need and the \n\n13 Fourth Amendment test provides a ­­ a ­­ a good familiar \n\n14 workable standard that can be used to determine that \n\n15 question. \n\n16  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You ­­ you mentioned the \n\n17 Fourth Amendment now, but as I understand it, the \n\n18 complaint just alleged a due process violation.  It \n\n19 didn\u0027t ­­ it didn\u0027t refer to the Fourth Amendment. \n\n20  MS. WARD:  That\u0027s correct, Your Honor.  And \n\n21 ­­ and the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process \n\n22 test as articulated in Bell does provide the clearest \n\n23 application by the Court of the rights of detainees in \n\n24 the prison context. \n\n25  And the Court has stated that Bell does\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\n1 apply to the excessive force claims of pretrial \n\n2 detainees and it makes perfect sense because, like a \n\n3 prison policy that goes too far, it\u0027s easy to see how \n\n4 a use of force can be administered as punishment. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"2","file_name":"Kingsley v.

The Model Penal Code seems to require both excessive \n\n24 force and some kind of state of mind, which could be\n\n25

as this Court has in the Eighth Amendment context, the \n\n4 understanding that punishment inherently requires some \n\n5 subjective mental state, the lowest available mental \n\n6 state is recklessness and under that standard, which the \n\n7 jury clearly was instructed under, we would prevail.  So \n\n8 that would lead to an affirmance. \n\n9  Now, I would still think, since it is \n\n10 well­established that the relevant standard for \n\n11 excessive force in cases involving convicted prisoners \n\n12 is the Johnson v. Glick standard, I think since that\u0027s \n\n13 established and nobody here is asking for Whitley or \n\n14 Hudson to be overruled, and there are so many practical \n\n15 imperatives for treating pretrial detainees and \n\n16 convicted prisoners the same, I think this Court should \n\n17 apply the Johnson v. Glick standard in the due process \n\n18 claims of pretrial detainees. \n\n19  In a subsequent case, if the Court wants to \n\n20 reconsider what the test should be even under the Eighth \n\n21 Amendment and apply it uniformly across pretrial \n\n22 detainees and convicted inmates, that may make some \n\n23 sense. \n\n24  I also think there\u0027s some very interesting \n\n25

Justice Kagan, there is a \n\n25 place for that in the doctrine.  I would submit it\u0027s not \n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n42\n\nOfficial\n\n1 in the excessive force cases.  So let me tell you where \n\n2 I think it is.  I mean, Sandin against Conner is a good\n\n3 example.  There the Court said that with convicted \n\n4 individuals, it was perfectly permissible to move them \n\n5 from minimum security to maximum security as a punitive \n\n6 matter, and you didn\u0027t even have to give them any \n\n7 process to do that.  I don\u0027t think that same analysis \n\n8 would apply to pretrial detainees. \n\n9  Another example is footnote 17 of the Bell \n\n10 against Wolfish case, where I think it\u0027s understood that \n\n11 at least if the statutory law provides for it, that if \n\n12 you\u0027re convicted, you can be sent out to the work gang \n\n13 and have to pick up trash along the highway.  I don\u0027t \n\n14 think you can do that to a pretrial detainee.  But \n\n15 whatever differences there are, I don\u0027t think they arise \n\n16 in an excessive force context.  I think if you think \n\n17 about this Court\u0027s cases, and start with Whitley.

singled out for a punitive beating in response to an \n\n13 altercation with the guard. \n\n14  Again, it makes no difference.  That\u0027s not \n\n15
