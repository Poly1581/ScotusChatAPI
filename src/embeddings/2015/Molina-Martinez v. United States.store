 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9  MR. CROOKS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11  As this Court recognized in Peugh v.\n\n12 United States, the United States Sentencing Guidelines\n\n13 remain uniquely central to Federal sentencing even where\n\n14 the district court ultimately chooses to sentence\n\n15 outside the Guidelines.\n\n16  Because of the strong anchoring effect of\n\n17 the Guidelines, as also recognized in Peugh, the natural\n\n18 effect of an erroneously high Guideline range is to skew\n\n19 a defendant\u0027s sentence higher than it would have been\n\n20 under the correct range.  Yet when the district court\n\n21 has elected to sentence within what it believes to be\n\n22 the correct range, it is typically very difficult to\n\n23 determine what the district court would have done had it\n\n24

discretion to address a question, even that was not in\n\n11 the question presented or addressed in the court below.\n\n12  And here, the court below undisputably\n\n13

The courts then know is this a career­offender\n\n3 bump that changes the defendant\u0027s offense level and\n\n4 criminal history and could double his range?  Or is it,\n\n5

 The last point I wanted to make, Your Honor,\n\n7 was just that we mentioned the courts\u0027 of appeals\n\n8 experience in this point.  And I think it\u0027s useful to\n\n9 look at what happened in the Third Circuit in terms of\n\n10 whether this kind of presumption could be confined to\n\n11 the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n12  In 2001, the Third Circuit, a decision\n\n13 called Adams, first announced it was going to presume\n\n14 prejudice for the denial of allocution, denial of a\n\n15 defendant\u0027s right to allocute at sentencing.  A few\n\n16

find a presumption of prejudice for constructive\n\n20 amendments to indictments.  And in 2005, when Booker\n\n21 came down from this Court, it then applied those\n\n22 precedents to find a presumption of prejudice for Booker\n\n23 error for sentencing under mandatory Sentencing\n\n24 Guidelines.\n\n25

It will be lower in the case of an overlapping range.\n\n7 But as this Court said in Glover v. United States, any\n\n8 extra amount of imprisonment affects substantial rights.\n\n9  Finally, I just wanted to say that the\n\n10 courts of appeals have overwhelmingly recognized,\n\n11 whether you call it a presumption or not, that it is\n\n12 warranted to find that a change in the Guideline range\n\n13 affected a defendant\u0027s substantial rights because of the\n\n14 extreme likelihood that a Guideline­range error will\n\n15 skew the sentence.\n\n16  And the lower courts have found, in their\n\n17 experience, that it\u0027s necessary to make that inference\n\n18 because of the great difficulty in the typical case of\n\n19 showing a case­specific effect of the type that the\n\n20 government is arguing for here.\n\n21  And these two factors mean that this\n\n22 inference or presumption, whatever it\u0027s termed, is\n\n23 necessary to avoid, in many cases, the injustice of\n\n24 excess imprisonment.\n\n25  And it will not blow up Rule 52(b), as the\n\nAlderson Court Reporting\n\n53\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 government warns.  It\u0027s a modest tweak to one prong of\n\n2\n the rule that will help the rule serve its basic purpose\n\n3 of fairness.\n\n4\n  And for these reasons, we ask that the Court\n\n5 reverse the judgment below and remand for further\n\n6 proceeding.\n\n7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
