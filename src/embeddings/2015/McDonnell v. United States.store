FRANCISCO: Well, to ­­ to actually, you\n\n2 know, conduct tobacco commission­funded State studies,\n\n3 but you still need to tell them what that is. But I\u0027ll\n\n4 get directly to your question. Why is it that the\n\n5 actual \"official acts\" are relevant? And that\u0027s because\n\n6 both the district court and the courts of appeals\u0027\n\n7 opinions made clear.\n\n8 Here in this case, the corrupt agreement\n\n9 turned entirely upon, as the district court case said.\n\n10 It hinged upon whether the five specific acts were, in\n\n11 fact, \"official acts,\" because in the absence of any\n\n12 direct evidence of a corrupt agreement, the government\u0027s\n\n13 argument was that you could infer one from the pattern\n\n14 of actual \"official acts\" on the one hand and the\n\n15 pattern of gifts and loans on the other and the temporal\n\n16 connection between the two.\n\n17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so is it your position\n\n18 at page 60 of the supplemental Joint Appendix ­­ the\n\n19 instructions aren\u0027t numbered, which makes it a little\n\n20 hard, but the judge instructs the jury that \"official\n\n21 actions\" are set forth in the five paragraphs of the\n\n22 indictment. And is it your position that at least some\n\n23 of those are not \"official acts\"?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"8","file_name":"McDonnell v.

FRANCISCO: No, Your Honor. I think\n\n3 that would be a very close case. That ­­ that would be\n\n4 a very close case, because at the end of the day, if\n\n5 you\u0027re not actually making a governmental decision or\n\n6 influencing the outcome of an actual governmental\n\n7 decision, I think you ­­ and Chief Justice, you might\n\n8 actually be violating a lot of other laws, including the\n\n9 separate provision in Section 201 that prohibits you\n\n10 from undertaking any act in violation of your official\n\n11 duties in exchange for money, or 5 U.S.C. 7353, which\n\n12 prohibits you from ­­ from taking anything from anyone\n\n13 whose interests could be affected by the performance or\n\n14 nonperformance of your duties.\n\n15 But I think that the line has to be, and the\n\n16 only line that comes out through the cases is, you\u0027re\n\n17 actually either making a decision on because of the\n\n18 government, or you\u0027re urging someone else to do so.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"12","file_name":"McDonnell v.

First, you still do need to tell the jury that that\u0027s\n\n14 what they have to find.\n\nAnd here, the jury was never\n\n15 told in any way, shape or form that they had to find an\n\n16 attempt to influence. So I think that is sufficient, in\n\n17 and of itself, to, at the very least, require a new\n\n18 trial here.\n\n19 Under these instructions, as the government\n\n20 itself seems to agree, any action within the range of\n\n21 official duties constitutes official governmental\n\n22 action.\n\n23 So Justice Kennedy, in the letter being sent\n\n24 over from a senator, since that is within the range of\n\n25 official duties, that counts under the government\u0027s\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n                          \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                     \n\n                       \n\n                           \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n \n\n                          \n\n                 \n\n                          \n\n                     \n\n24\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 formulation, and under the jury instruction as given,\n\n2 since it is, after all, a settled practice of officials\n\n3 to send these kinds of letters. That\u0027s why it was\n\n4 incumbent upon the district court to draw some kind of\n\n5 limit.\n\n6 And here, the jury could well have agreed\n\n7 with us that even though he was the governor of the\n\n8 State, Mr. Chief Justice, he did not try to influence\n\n9 the actual decision. He simply made the same type of\n\n10 referral that he made day in and day out during this\n\n11 administration where he simply sent a constituent to the\n\n12 appropriate official ­­\n\n13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Francisco ­­\n\n14 MR.

First, this Court has\n\n10 addressed that very issue in the McCormick case. And it\n\n11 is established that merely taking favorable action at or\n\n12 around the time of the receipt of campaign contributions\n\n13 is not sufficient to show a quid pro quo and is not a\n\n14 crime.\n\n15 Nobody doubts that if there\u0027s a quid pro quo\n\n16 for a vote, something that I think Mr. Francisco is\n\n17 prepared to concede is \"official action,\" although I\u0027m\n\n18 not sure why since it doesn\u0027t personally exercise\n\n19 sovereign power if a legislator casts vote as a\n\n20 dissenting vote from a majority action. But nobody\n\n21 disputes that that is a crime. Therefore, this Court\n\n22 has already carved out evidentiary and instructional\n\n23 safeguards that prevent against a jury inferring a quid\n\n24 pro quo merely from the coincidence of timing.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"40","file_name":"McDonnell v.
