The Tenth\n\n17 Circuit\u0027s rule, however, injects unnecessary complexity.\n\n18 Identifying the last discriminatory act in an alleged\n\n19 hostile work environment can be difficult.\n\n20 And as this Court said in early ­­\n\n21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the statute say?\n\n22 Can we look at the statute?

MR.\n\nGANNON: Well, I think that\u0027s right, but\n\n16 ­­ and I think that ­­ but it\u0027s also the case that in\n\n17 many cases, in fact in most cases, there isn\u0027t going to\n\n18 be very much time between these two dates, and therefore\n\n19 it usually isn\u0027t going to be that dispositive.\n\n20 In this case, we think that the things\n\n21 happened on the same day. Even under Petitioner\u0027s\n\n22 approach, he had some weeks to make his decision. But\n\n23 the reason why he wasn\u0027t prejudiced by being able to\n\n24 take some weeks to make his decision is precisely\n\n25 because he was using annual leave, he wasn\u0027t suffering\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n \n\n                          \n\n       \n\n                       \n\n              \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n                       \n\n                           \n\n   \n\n                          \n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n           \n\n     \n\n                        \n\n37\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the consequences of a hostile work environment, he\n\n2 hadn\u0027t taken the pay cut, he hadn\u0027t had to move 400\n\n3 miles away, and so this was an unusual case where he\n\n4 would have been able to take that much time.\n\n5 And so it looks like, as in ­­ in\n\n6 practicality\u0027s sake, that ­­ that it hasn\u0027t made a big\n\n7 difference.

To be\n\n18 sure, the Court says, we treat those two the same for\n\n19 remedial purposes in the sense that an employee who has\n\n20 been constructively discharged can recover for that to\n\n21 the same degree and for the same extent as if he or she\n\n22 had been actually discharged.\n\n23 That makes sense because you have this\n\n24 background duty to mitigate and, in the circumstance of\n\n25 a constructive discharge, we don\u0027t think the employee\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n            \n\n                 \n\n                           \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n         \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n            \n\n           \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n             \n\n           \n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\n1 should be tagged with the consequences of having, you\n\n2 know, so­called failed to mitigate damages.

And as\n\n19 this Court explained in Suders, the constructive\n\n20 discharge entails both predicate discrimination ­­ and\n\n21 we do think it has to be independently actionable. We\n\n22 think the Court recognized that when it said in Suders\n\n23 that for Ms. Suders to prove her hostile work\n\n24 environment claim was quoting necessary predicate to her\n\n25 constructive discharge claim, and that\u0027s also the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                  \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n              \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n             \n\n               \n\n              \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                 \n\nOfficial\n\n50\n\n1 uniform holding in the courts of appeals.

It is not entirely correct that\n\n22 the Tenth Circuit did not address this. At Petition\n\n23 Appendix 2A, here\u0027s what the Tenth Circuit said: That\n\n24 shortly after being put on leave he signed a settlement\n\n25 agreement under which he would choose either to retire\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                     \n\n                  \n\n \n\n                        \n\n         \n\n                 \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n   \n\n                          \n\n                    \n\n                     \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                            \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n   \n\n56\n\nOfficial\n\n1 or to work in a position that paid much less and was\n\n2 about 300 miles away.

WOLFMAN: Right. There are two answers\n\n12 to that, Justice Breyer. First of all, I do want to\n\n13 challenge the premise of the seven illustrative cases\n\n14 cited in Suders, illustrative for constructive\n\n15 discharge. Three of them were standalone constructive\n\n16 discharges, untethered to any other claim; that\u0027s\n\n17 number 1.\n\n18 Number 2, even if you have what this Court\n\n19 in Suders called a subset of constructive discharge\n\n20 cases, that is one arising out of a hostile work\n\n21 environment, they are still distinct claims. That\u0027s\n\n22 really the point of Suders. They\u0027re distinct claims,\n\n23 they\u0027re separately actionable, and we know they\u0027re\n\n24 separately actionable because the constructive­discharge\n\n25 claim is not actionable until resignation.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                      \n\n                       \n\n                        \n\n                   \n\n                \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n                          \n\n     \n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Unless the Court has anything further.\n\n2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n\n3 Ms. Carroll, this Court appointed you to\n\n4 brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support\n\n5 of the judgment below.
