VILLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n11 please the Court:\n\n12 There are three reasons to exclude reckless\n\n13 misdemeanors from the phrase \"use... of physical force\"\n\n14 as occurs in 921(a)(33).\n\n15 The first is that it\u0027s consistent with the\n\n16 definition of use that this Court has implemented in\n\n17 other cases. Second, it is consistent with the\n\n18 common­law definition of battery. And, third, it is\n\n19 consistent with the intentionality inherent in domestic\n\n20 violence.\n\n21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it\u0027s inconsistent\n\n22 with the treatment of bodily injury. I mean, I think\n\n23 you agree, because the Court so held, that either bodily\n\n24 injury or offensive touching is the act ­­ satisfies the\n\n25 act requirement. And you say if there\u0027s bodily injury,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n            \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n               \n\n              \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                    \n\n           \n\n                       \n\n    \n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 then reckless is enough, but if it\u0027s only offensive\n\n2 touching, then you need a higher mental state,\n\n3 intentional or knowing?

the briefing on both\n\n15 sides of this has been talking about the common law\n\n16 until it\u0027s coming out of your ears, and it\u0027s not clear\n\n17 to me why the common law makes any difference at all\n\n18 here.\n\n19 I mean, you know, Congress was operating\n\n20 against a backdrop. It was not the backdrop of the\n\n21 common law; it was the backdrop of 50 States having\n\n22 battery statutes. There\u0027s no word in this statute which\n\n23 is a defined ­­ you know, which is a ­­ a settled\n\n24 common­law term.\n\n25 So the question is, what was Congress doing?\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n     \n\n                         \n\n              \n\n           \n\n               \n\n                       \n\n                     \n\n        \n\n                           \n\n                           \n\n   \n\n                             \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n         \n\n                            \n\n           \n\n                   \n\n                \n\n21\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Congress, we said in Castleman, wanted to basically\n\n2 capture the set of battery statutes in which ­­ which\n\n3 were used for people engaged in domestic violence.\n\n4 Almost all of those statutes use \"recklessness\" within\n\n5 them. Why isn\u0027t that the proper place to look rather\n\n6 than the common law?\n\n7 MS. VILLA: Because Congress used a narrower\n\n8 definition than many battery statutes.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\n13 it please the Court:\n\n14 This Court has twice interpreted\n\n15 Section 922(g)(9) in Hazen and Castleman, and each time\n\n16 concluded that Congress intended to keep guns away from\n\n17 those convicted of assault and battery under generally\n\n18 applicable State and Federal and Tribal law.\n\n19 Petitioner attempts to distinguish between\n\n20 offenses that cause bodily injury and those that involve\n\n21 offensive touching. But as this Court already decided\n\n22 in Castleman, that is a fallacy; that distinction is\n\n23 elusive.

And I respectfully submit that there is no\n\n4 such grievous ambiguity. Congress\u0027s intent was clear,\n\n5 and this Court already found as much, in Castleman and\n\n6 in Hayes, which is that there was a class of offenses\n\n7 that Congress intended to cover by the statute which\n\n8 were generally applicable assault and battery statutes.\n\n9 And the rule that Petitioner suggests would\n\n10 exclude all of those offenses and would frustrate that\n\n11 clear purpose of Congress, so lenity doesn\u0027t apply for\n\n12 that reason. And there\u0027s no ambiguity, not only as to\n\n13 the purpose, but as to ­­ as to what battery itself\n\n14 encompasses. Petitioners have tried to argue that\n\n15 battery, either at common law or in contemporary\n\n16 practice, that there was some requirement of an intent\n\n17 to do harm. And the overwhelming weight and universal\n\n18 weight of authority points the opposite direction. Even\n\n19 the sources cited by Petitioner establish that at common\n\n20 law, there was no requirement for the intent to do harm.\n\n21 And certainly States, in adopting their assault and\n\n22 battery provisions, have modeled that ­­ that\n\n23 formulation.\n\n24 Another way to look at this is ­­ outside of\n\n25 the common law, is the way that Taylor examined the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n               \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n               \n\n           \n\n     \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n                      \n\n                     \n\n35\n\nOfficial\n\n1 statute of burglary under the ACCA offense, which is","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"33","file_name":"Voisine v.
