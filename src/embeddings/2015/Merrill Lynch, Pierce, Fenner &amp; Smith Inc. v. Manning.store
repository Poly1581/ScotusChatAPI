Manning.\n\n6 Mr. Hacker.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n9 MR. HACKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 In language that differs distinctly from the\n\n12 \"arising under\" language of Section 1331, Exchange Act\n\n13 Section 27 confers on the Federal courts exclusive\n\n14 jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty\n\n15 created by the Exchange Act and its regulations. That\n\n16 language establishes a straightforward test.\n\n17 The Federal court has exclusive jurisdiction\n\n18 if the suit is brought to enforce Exchange Act duties\n\n19 even if the suit is also brought to enforce State law\n\n20 duties.\n\n21 In particular, the words \"brought to\n\n22 enforce\" focus on what the plaintiff itself wants the\n\n23 court to decide, not on what the court would necessarily\n\n24 have to decide, as 1331 has been read to require.\n\n25 By applying the 1331 test, the Third Circuit\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n           \n\n               \n\n             \n\n           \n\n             \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n             \n\n           \n\n           \n\n   \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n \n\n                          \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n                \n\nOfficial\n\n4\n\n1 not only ignored Section 27\u0027s distinct language but also\n\n2 its distinct policies, which strongly disfavor State\n\n3 court adjudication of Exchange Act duties and thus are\n\n4 exactly the opposite of the policies favoring State\n\n5 court adjudication that underlie the Jackson Pollock\n\n6 canvas this Court has painted over Section 1331.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner \u0026amp; Smith Inc. v.

in his reply that there\u0027s a current\n\n15 statute, 28 U.S.C. 1337, that was enacted in 1948. It\n\n16 had a predecessor statute, 28 U.S.C. 41(8) that was\n\n17 enacted in 1911 that removed the amount­in­controversy\n\n18 requirement for cases involving interstate commerce.\n\n19 And one would think, because it\u0027s the case\n\n20 today, that that would apply to securities. But as best\n\n21 we can understand from our research, in the years that\n\n22 are relevant, 1911 to the time of the \u002733 Act and \u002734\n\n23 Act, it was not interpreted that way.\n\n24 So there was essentially an\n\n25 amount­in­controversy requirement for securities cases.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                \n\n     \n\n                           \n\n                \n\n \n\n                       \n\n   \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n             \n\n         \n\n           \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n       \n\n                      \n\n                           \n\n \n\n                   \n\n                           \n\n \n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\n1 So I think, if I were to ­­\n\n2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The amount in controversy\n\n3 wasn\u0027t very high.

But I think it does.\n\n21 So ­­ so this particular statutory language is found in\n\n22 eleven statutes. In some of them, they used the term\n\n23 \"exclusive jurisdiction\"; in ­­ in others, they did not.\n\n24 What follows exclusive jurisdiction is\n\n25 essentially a creation test that ­­ which I\u0027ll explain\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                  \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                                  \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                          \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n                          \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                               \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\n1 in a moment. The fact that they chose to confer\n\n2 exclusive jurisdiction here just means that, when there\n\n3 was a cause of action that was created by the\n\n4 Exchange Act, they wanted it to be in Federal court.\n\n5 So ­­ so let me ­­ let me get to the spirit\n\n6 of ­­ of the answer, which is why I think that there\u0027s\n\n7 good reason to believe that exclusive jurisdiction in\n\n8 the statute is limited to causes of action that are\n\n9 created by the Act itself.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"31","file_name":"Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner \u0026amp; Smith Inc. v.

MR.\n\nSTRIS: I agree.\n\n10 JUSTICE ALITO: All right.\n\nSo you seem to\n\n11 be saying that the category of claims they did not want\n\n12 adjudicated in State court are only these: Those in\n\n13 which the plaintiff is asking for the enforcement of a\n\n14 Federal duty, and there is no comparable State duty at\n\n15 that time, and the State court is unwilling to recognize\n\n16 a comparable State duty in the context of that\n\n17 litigation.\n\n18 So these are essentially cases in which the\n\n19 State is basically hostile to the Federal duty.

So if we look at the context, we have a\n\n9 history of States regulating securities.\n\nWe have a\n\n10 parallel provision in the Exchange Act, Section 28, that\n\n11 this Court in Matsushita

were thinking we\n\n16 have a very narrow window of claims that are created by\n\n17 this Act. And for those, a 9(a) straightforward market\n\n18 manipulation claim, for ­­ for ­­ for wash sales. We\n\n19 don\u0027t want State courts adjudicating those, because\n\n20 those are very technical.

That\u0027s what\n\n20 created what they call counterfeit shares. That, in and\n\n21 of itself, forgetting intent, is also what diluted the\n\n22 shares and caused their problems. That\u0027s clear from\n\n23 paragraph 33. It\u0027s clear in paragraph 86 and 87.

The first argument they make is that it\n\n13 effectively incorporates the Holmesian view that it has\n\n14 to be a cause of action created by the Act itself.\n\n15 The ­­ Section 27 answers that question. It\n\n16 doesn\u0027t say that jurisdiction is established for ­­ over\n\n17 causes of action established by the Exchange Act. That\n\n18 would have been the way that Congress would have said\n\n19 it. If they meant to say there is jurisdiction over\n\n20 causes of action established by the Act, Congress would\n\n21 have said that. It didn\u0027t say anything like that. What\n\n22 it said was very much essentially the opposite or\n\n23 something very different, which is suits brought to\n\n24 enforce duties prescribed by ­­ created by the Act.\n\n25 It\u0027s about the substantive source of the ­­ the source\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n   \n\n                        \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n              \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                   \n\n                         \n\n                           \n\n              \n\n             \n\n     \n\n                       \n\n                            \n\n           \n\n             \n\n             \n\n             \n\n \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n59\n\nOfficial\n\n1 of the ­­","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"57","file_name":"Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner \u0026amp; Smith Inc. v.
