BERNSTEIN: Because in Standard Oil, the\n\n12 issue was the underlying status of the Federal\n\n13 government arm, and the Court said that question is\n\n14 controlled by Federal law. Standard Oil is like Miller\n\n15 itself, where the issue was: What does the Eighth\n\n16 Amendment require? That\u0027s a Federal constitutional\n\n17 issue it applied.\n\n18 In Standard Oil, as a combination of statute\n\n19 regulations and Federal common law, Federal law\n\n20 controlled the question.

But they\n\n8 follow it as a matter of choice and not because they\n\n9 think they\u0027re bound by the Federal rules.\n\n10 So let\u0027s say that there is a ­­ a\n\n11 disagreement in Federal court about what Federal Rule of\n\n12 Evidence 403 means. The State court says, well, you\n\n13 know, we\u0027re going to follow the ­­ the Federal rule, and\n\n14 we think that the right course as between these two\n\n15 divergent Federal courts of appeals is the Second\n\n16 Circuit.

We broke it out into its component parts\n\n4 because I think it facilitates the analysis of it to\n\n5 understand that Miller does have a procedural component.\n\n6 Sentencing courts must now consider the mitigating\n\n7 characteristics of age, but it also, and more\n\n8 fundamentally in our view, contains a substantive\n\n9 component that required a change in the law.\n\n10 Now, the change here was expanding the range\n\n11 of outcomes. Previously when this Court has analyzed\n\n12 substantive changes in the law, there have been changes\n\n13 that restricted the form of outcome; say, for example,\n\n14 in Justice Breyer\u0027s hypothetical, forbidding punishment\n\n15 at all.\n\n16 But I think that if you trace back the\n\n17 origins of the substantive category to Justice Harlan\u0027s\n\n18 opinion in Mackey, this is still faithful to what\n\n19 Justice Harlan had in mind. Justice Harlan said the\n\n20 clearest case of an injustice in not applying a rule\n\n21 retroactively is when it puts off­limits altogether\n\n22 criminal punishment.

And I think if you put this case on the\n\n6 speculative­significant risk axis, this case falls in\n\n7 the significant risk domain precisely because of the\n\n8 reasons why the Court said it was deciding Miller.\n\n9 The reasons why the Court decided Miller had\n\n10 to do with the reduced culpability of youth and the\n\n11 capacity of youth to mature, change, and achieve a\n\n12 degree of rehabilitation that is consistent with\n\n13 something less than the most harsh sentence available\n\n14 for youths who commit murder ­­ a terrible crime, but\n\n15 still the harshest sentence, the Court thought, would be\n\n16 reserved for the worst of the worst, which is, in fact,\n\n17 what Louisiana said when it amended its statutes\n\n18 substantively to conform them to Miller. It said life\n\n19 without parole should be reserved for the worst\n\n20 offenders who commit the worst crimes.\n\n21 And so when you combine the fact that this\n\n22 is not a rule that ­­ that only governs procedure ­­ it\n\n23 doesn\u0027t just govern evidence; it also mandates changes\n\n24 in outcomes as an available option ­­ with the very\n\n25 genesis of the Miller rule in a conclusion that, for the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                       \n\n     \n\n                 \n\n                       \n\n                        \n\n                    \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n                \n\n             \n\n                     \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n           \n\n37\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 people in this class, the appropriateness of the\n\n2 punishment of the harshest degree, life without parole,\n\n3 will be relatively uncommon, it seems clear that the\n\n4 Miller rule falls on the substantive side of the axis\n\n5 rather than on the procedural side of the axis.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"34","file_name":"Montgomery v.

BERNSTEIN: What this fantastic\n\n4 discussion has shown is why the Court, as it always has\n\n5 in the past, should keep the Teague exceptions a matter\n\n6 of equitable discretion, rather than constitutional\n\n7 requirement.\n\n8 The Court has much more freedom, generally\n\n9 speaking, on the matter of equitable discretion than it\n\n10 does on constitutional requirements. There is no way to\n\n11 look at the prior precedents of the Court in Teague in\n\n12 any of those courts to say, oh, here\u0027s what our\n\n13 equitable discretion is. The only time you get\n\n14 retroactivity is when the Constitution requires it.\n\n15 That would have been a really short opinion. And that\n\n16 was not that.\n\n17 Now, to turn quickly to the cases that have\n\n18 been cited: The critical difference between this case\n\n19 on the one hand and Merrell Dow and Three Affiliated\n\n20 Tribes on the other hand is that jurisdiction under this\n\n21 statute is question by question under Murdock.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"67","file_name":"Montgomery v.
