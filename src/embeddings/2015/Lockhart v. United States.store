ZAS\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. ZAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 This case concerns the ten­year mandatory\n\n12 minimum prison sentence that Section 2252(b)(2)\n\n13 sometimes requires Federal judges to impose.\n\n14 The statutory language in dispute reserves\n\n15 the severe punishment for a defendant with a prior State\n\n16 conviction for an offense relating to any kind of sexual\n\n17 abuse involving a minor or ward. Because Petitioner\u0027s\n\n18 prior offense did not involve a minor or ward, the\n\n19 statute\u0027s mandatory minimum penalty does not apply to\n\n20 him.\n\n21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the conviction\n\n22 had been, under Federal law, the ­­ the conviction for\n\n23 sexual abuse of an adult and we have the same question:\n\n24 Does the mandatory minimum apply?\n\n25 I take it if it had been under Federal law,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n         \n\n                          \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n       \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                          \n\n           \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n                               \n\n                         \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n       \n\n                         \n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 then the mandatory minimum would apply.\n\n2 MR. ZAS: That\u0027s correct. If the conviction\n\n3 had been under Chapter 109A of Title XVIII, which covers\n\n4 sexual abuse offenses, then it would trigger the\n\n5 mandatory penalty. But Congress, in this statute, since\n\n6 the time it was first enacted in 1978, has never sought","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Lockhart v.

It limited the reach of the\n\n3 terms by setting a bright line floor. And that floor\n\n4 was at children. The statute, after all, its principal\n\n5 purpose as its title, as the title of Chapter 110\n\n6 suggests, is about protecting against sexual\n\n7 exploitation and other abuse of children.\n\n8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Zas, is it possible when\n\n9 you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might\n\n10 have meant to be just trying to pick up every\n\n11 conceivable State statute it could think of. But it\u0027s\n\n12 possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual\n\n13 abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the\n\n14 medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is\n\n15 actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words,\n\n16 might include things that are not sexual abuse\n\n17 themselves. Let\u0027s say indecent exposure or something\n\n18 like that.\n\n19 And if you understand the provisions in that\n\n20 way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and\n\n21 meant to pick up everything, then it would seem that the\n\n22 involving a minor or ward really ought to refer to all\n\n23 of them. Right? That there\u0027s no reason why the\n\n24 involving a minor or ward would ­­ would refer only to\n\n25 the most minor offenses as the others.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                             \n\n                      \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n            \n\n                         \n\n            \n\n                 \n\n                              \n\n                 \n\n            \n\n                          \n\n     \n\n                             \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                \n\n          \n\n               \n\n \n\n                         \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"10","file_name":"Lockhart v.

offenses Section 2251(e), Petitioner agrees that the\n\n19 only way you can read that penalty provision is to\n\n20 include State sexual abuse offenses against adults,\n\n21 because Congress worded it slightly differently. They\n\n22 included all the same crimes, but the way that provision\n\n23 is ­­ reads, it says, \"State laws relating to aggravated\n\n24 sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact\n\n25 involving a minor or a ward or sex trafficking of\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                            \n\n                     \n\n                        \n\n                      \n\n           \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                        \n\n                           \n\n             \n\n                        \n\n                         \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                       \n\n                             \n\n37\n\nOfficial\n\n1 children.\"\n\n2 So it\u0027s no longer ­­ involving a minor or\n\n3 ward is no longer a modifier that appears at the end of\n\n4 a list.

O\u0027CONNELL: I think the Court has\n\n9 typically applied the same­strength rule of lenity to\n\n10 both substantive provisions and penalty provisions.\n\n11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That ­­ that makes a great\n\n12 deal of sense. It ­­ other than that rule of lenity to\n\n13 the extent it\u0027s based on notice, it seems to have\n\n14 somewhat more force when it applies to the substantive\n\n15 definition of the offense as opposed to the punishment.\n\n16 But I ­­ you could argue it either ­­ either way.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"41","file_name":"Lockhart v.
