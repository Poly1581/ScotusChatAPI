SREBNICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n9 and may it please the Court:\n\n10 The Sixth Amendment has always recognized\n\n11 the individual\u0027s right to spend his own money to obtain\n\n12 the advice and assistance of counsel. At the time of\n\n13 the adoption of the Bill of Rights, that was the core\n\n14 right, a time when the right to appointed counsel had\n\n15 not yet been established by this Court.\n\n16 We submit that the right to representation\n\n17 by private counsel must allow a defendant to use assets\n\n18 which she rightfully owns, assets over which there is no\n\n19 dispute that she has good title, so that she may be\n\n20 represented by the lawyer that she prefers.\n\n21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do about\n\n22 Monsanto?\n\n23 MR.

MR.\n\nSREBNICK: Well, I\u0027m complaining that\n\n12 the Sixth Amendment, because at its root contemplated\n\n13 the use of property to retain counsel, the two in some\n\n14 degree are interrelated, of course, because without\n\n15 money 220 years ago or so, you couldn\u0027t hire a lawyer,\n\n16 and none would be appointed for you.\n\n17 So while the Court has accommodated the\n\n18 indigent by providing them with appointed counsel, that\n\n19 is not a license for the government to render people who\n\n20 are not indigent, indigent. It\u0027s not a license to\n\n21 impoverish them by virtue of the accusation alone. That\n\n22 would simply write out the Sixth Amendment from the\n\n23 Constitution.\n\n24 In every single case where there is a victim\n\n25 who claims injury, every single one, the government has\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n   \n\n                              \n\n               \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                           \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\n1 by definition probable cause because the indictment is\n\n2 based on probable cause. And it\u0027s not subject to\n\n3 challenge under the Kaley opinion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress seemed to\n\n11 have singled out these banking frauds and healthcare\n\n12 frauds for special treatment, so they\u0027re not governed by\n\n13 the general forfeiture

They seem to\n\n15 want to come down very hard on these two crimes. So why\n\n16 would we interpret ­­ was it 1345? ­­ as doing nothing,\n\n17 as being controlled essentially by 853?\n\n18 MR. SREBNICK: So 1345, although it doesn\u0027t\n\n19 use the word \"forfeiture,\" it doesn\u0027t say what happens\n\n20 to these assets. It simply locks them down, so to\n\n21 speak, until something happens. It doesn\u0027t even talk\n\n22 about a criminal case, but it is in the context of\n\n23 Title 18.

And the last sentence of\n\n20 Monsanto says, \"If the government may, posttrial, forbid\n\n21 the use of forfeited assets to pay an attorney, then\n\n22 surely no constitutional violation occurs when after\n\n23 probable cause is adequately established, the government\n\n24 obtains an order barring a defendant from frustrating\n\n25 that end by dissipating his assets prior to trial.\"\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                         \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n       \n\n                              \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n             \n\n       \n\n                   \n\n                         \n\n                    \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n            \n\n                        \n\n                     \n\n       \n\n                       \n\n                             \n\n                           \n\n \n\nOfficial\n\n27\n\n1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that was said\n\n2 in the context of the government\u0027s submission that\n\n3 there\u0027s a difference between tainted and untainted,\n\n4 right?

can\u0027t we read this statute to say\n\n2 they accommodate those interests in this way?\n\n3 If they\u0027re going to run away from ­­ with\n\n4 the property, then the court has the authority to enjoin\n\n5 the alienation or disposition of property, say tainted,\n\n6 then you can ask for a restraining order to prohibit the\n\n7 prohibition, not just of the tainted property but also\n\n8 of property of equivalent value.\n\n9 If I read that without knowing the\n\n10 background, I would say a lot of cases come up where you\n\n11 get TROs, where they\u0027re not precise because you don\u0027t\n\n12 know exactly what property you\u0027re talking about. So\n\n13 what do you think about reading this statute to avoid\n\n14 the constitutional question to say the TRO means TRO?\n\n15 And a TRO means where there\u0027s some property\n\n16 out there and it may be tainted, mixed up with the\n\n17 untainted, you can get a TRO on the whole thing. You\n\n18 have to have a speedy hearing. He has to be\n\n19 represented. And your purpose of that is to separate\n\n20 the two kinds of assets. That seems to me to work for\n\n21 the purpose, and it also avoids the constitutional\n\n22 question.\n\n23 MR. DREEBEN: So two things on that.

(A)(2)\n\n14 it allows it to restrain assets as the ultimate object\n\n15 of the suit, not as a temporary interim measure.\n\n16 Temporary interim measures are described in\n\n17 Subsection (B) where it specifically allows the Court to\n\n18 impose various restraints until the Court has concluded\n\n19 the proceeding. So it addresses temporary relief in\n\n20 (B).\n\n21 Subsection (A)(2) describes the things that\n\n22 the government can seek as the ultimate object of the\n\n23 case.

For the reasons that I explained to Justice\n\n21 Breyer, this statute doesn\u0027t limit the restraining order\n\n22 to temporary relief, nor would it make any logical sense\n\n23 to do that because the purpose of this statute was to\n\n24 preserve funds so that they would be available at the\n\n25 conclusion of the case.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                            \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n   \n\n                           \n\n           \n\n             \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                   \n\n                               \n\n                \n\n               \n\n              \n\n                 \n\n                      \n\n           \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                             \n\nOfficial\n\n52\n\n1 I also think that the amicus argument is not\n\n2 a tenable one because it simply reads \"or equivalent\n\n3 value\" out of the statute and without any reference to\n\n4 the context of the statute, which is to try to make the\n\n5 government be able to be made whole at the conclusion of\n\n6 a case if, in fact, it obtains a judgment given the very","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"51","file_name":"Luis v.
