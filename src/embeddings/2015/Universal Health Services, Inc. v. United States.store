ENGLERT: Justice Breyer, it would not\n\n11 satisfy most of those concerns for several reasons.\n\n12 First and foremost, the False Claims Act has\n\n13 its own definition of materiality, which is greatly\n\n14 watered down from the common law. Something that is\n\n15 capable of influencing a decisionmaker is material under\n\n16 the False Claims Act. So materiality doesn\u0027t solve the\n\n17 problem.\n\n18 Now let me say also that materiality is, at\n\n19 least arguably, a different element. When I say \"at\n\n20 least arguably,\" the statute actually doesn\u0027t say under\n\n21 (a)(1)(A) that it has to be material, but courts have\n\n22 properly read materiality in. But even if materiality\n\n23 is read in, it\u0027s a different element on top of a false\n\n24 or fraudulent claim.\n\n25 And I really want to bring this Court back\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n           \n\n       \n\n                        \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n        \n\n                        \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n   \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n                 \n\n                       \n\n                \n\n                         \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n12\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 with respect to the four words \"false or fraudulent\n\n2 claim\" because for it to be fraudulent, there must be,\n\n3 as Your Honor said, an implicit lie.
