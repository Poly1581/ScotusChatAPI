ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n10 and may it please the Court:\n\n11 The fundamental problem with the statutes at\n\n12 issue in these three cases is that they make it a\n\n13 criminal offense to assert a constitutional right.\n\n14 Under laws of North Dakota and Minnesota, a person who\n\n15 is stopped on suspicion of impaired driving is obligated\n\n16 to take a warrantless chemical test to determine the\n\n17 alcohol content of their blood.\n\n18 The States concede that these tests are\n\n19 searches under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The\n\n20 United States and North Dakota appear to recognize that\n\n21 no exception under the recognized exceptions of the law\n\n22 requirement applies.

consistently from Chimel on through Riley most recently\n\n9 that search incident to arrest turns on the existence of\n\n10 one of two considerations, either the search is\n\n11 necessary to preserve officer safety, or to preserve\n\n12 evidence.\n\n13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think that this\n\n14 would be based on the notion that it\u0027s necessary to\n\n15 preserve evidence, plus the notion which Justice Breyer\n\n16 suggested that this is about as uninvasive as a search\n\n17 can possibly be. And so that given those two things\n\n18 together, that it is useful to preserve evidence and\n\n19 that it is a extremely uninvasive search, that we can\n\n20 assimilate it into the search­incident­to­arrest\n\n21 doctrine.\n\n22 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me answer both of\n\n23 those points. On ­­ on the preservation of evidence,\n\n24 the evidence that\u0027s being tested here is the\n\n25 blood­alcohol level, so alcohol level in the blood.

­­\n\n13 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you say something\n\n14 about what the practical consequences of requiring a\n\n15 warrant for every Breathalyzer would be in a State like\n\n16 North Dakota? I ­­ when ­­ my picture of North Dakota\n\n17 is that it\u0027s not like New York City. You don\u0027t have\n\n18 night court going on all the time. And so how many of\n\n19 these tests occur during some period of time, and how\n\n20 many magistrates would you have on duty, let\u0027s say, at\n\n21 2:00 o\u0027clock in the morning to field a request for a\n\n22 warrant?\n\n23 MR. McCARTHY: Well, I\u0027ll ­­ the first ­­\n\n24 first part of my answer is that if a warrant was\n\n25 required in every case, that would go well beyond what\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n              \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                            \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                    \n\n              \n\n             \n\n                            \n\n                   \n\n                    \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                      \n\n           \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n42\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 the Fourth Amendment requires. Because even this ­­\n\n2 even in McNeely the Court acknowledged that many cases\n\n3 of warrant won\u0027t be required.\n\n4 But in North Dakota, Your Honor brings up an\n\n5 interesting point. It\u0027s not that there are judges or\n\n6 magistrates on ­­ on duty all the time in North Dakota.\n\n7 In fact, they\u0027re considered what is known there as on\n\n8 call. So they\u0027re not on duty, but they may be ­­\n\n9 they\u0027re reachable somewhere, typically by phone. But it\n\n10 often takes a while, especially in rural jurisdictions.\n\n11 JUSTICE BREYER: How long?

But there is a delay in getting the warrant at\n\n17 times.\n\n18 In the Maryland case, you can get it as soon\n\n19 as 15 minutes. But a warrant can take as long as a half\n\n20 hour or for as long as 90 minutes or two hours. That\u0027s\n\n21 at page 37 of the study. So I think it would be a big\n\n22 mistake for this Court to decide the case.\n\n23 I was going to say in the McNeely footnote,\n\n24 the Court listed 33 states that have electronic\n\n25 warrants, which is not the same as 24/7 judicial\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                \n\n                      \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n                    \n\n   \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                                \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n   \n\n                         \n\n           \n\n             \n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n63\n\n1 availability.

ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n20 And if I may, I\u0027ll make three quick points,\n\n21 two legal and one practical.\n\n22 First, I think given the discussion here,\n\n23 the Court should not lose sight of the ­­ what we think\n\n24 is the fundamental legal proposition, what\u0027s going on in\n\n25 this case, which is in North Dakota and Minnesota,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n             \n\n            \n\n               \n\n \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n              \n\n \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n           \n\n               \n\n \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n           \n\n71\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 people who drive on the roads are automatically ­­\n\n2 irrevocably lose their Fourth Amendment right to resist\n\n3 warrantless searches. There\u0027s no consent here, there\u0027s\n\n4 no knowledge that\u0027s been demonstrated on the part of\n\n5 these defendants.\n\n6 So the ­­ the proposition that\u0027s being\n\n7 offered by the government is that States can simply\n\n8 attach to any benefit that is provided to individuals\n\n9 the surrender of a constitutional right, whether or not\n\n10 the individuals know that they\u0027re going to do it. And\n\n11 in the future, a criminal penalty can be attached to the\n\n12 exercise of that constitutional right.

the warrant process as something that\u0027s going to be\n\n18 effective that drives down test refusal, that makes\n\n19 confrontations between officers and drivers\n\n20 substantially reduced, and that drives up DUI\n\n21 convictions. And so warrants are an effective way of\n\n22 addressing this. And as the Court said in Riley, the\n\n23 answer to a situation like this is simply get the\n\n24 warrant.\n\n25 A third, final point on the question of\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                \n\n \n\n                            \n\n                \n\n               \n\n           \n\n               \n\n          \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                        \n\n                       \n\n                  \n\n                          \n\n     \n\n73\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 breath versus blood tests, the Court, so far as I\u0027m\n\n2 aware, has never said that once there is a search that\u0027s\n\n3 taken place in a law enforcement investigation, that one\n\n4 can cut out certain character ­­ certain ­­ certain\n\n5 types of procedures or certain types of evidence that\u0027s\n\n6 being sought. The presumption is that a warrant should\n\n7 be required.\n\n8 And in the Skinner case, I mean, the Court\n\n9 addressed both blood and ­­ and breath tests. Although\n\n10 it noted there were differences between the two, it\n\n11 treated them identically for Fourth Amendment purposes.\n\n12 It said that they have essentially very, very similar\n\n13 characteristics. They involve similar personal ­­\n\n14 degrees of personal intrusion.
