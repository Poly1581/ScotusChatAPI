SAENZ: I think it would be, in candor,\n\n15 subject to a challenge that would revolve around the\n\n16 circumstances and the reasoning behind that new\n\n17 legislation. It\u0027s important, of course, to note that\n\n18 Texas has not done that. And there\u0027s no indication that\n\n19 its legislative process would result in determining that\n\n20 its previous decision that subsidized licenses make\n\n21 sense without limit has some endpoint.

This is the statute that defines the\n\n6 term \"lawfully present.\" Under that statute, if you are\n\n7 in deferred­action status, you are lawfully present and\n\n8 eligible for benefits.\n\n9 Now that statute goes on to say if you are\n\n10 just an individual as to whom DHS has declined to pursue\n\n11 removal proceedings, you are not lawfully present. So\n\n12 whether you are in deferred­action status makes a\n\n13 difference under the agency\u0027s own regulations. It\u0027s\n\n14 that affirmative act of not just forbearing and making\n\n15 the decision not to remove somebody, but putting them\n\n16 into deferred­action status that triggers the\n\n17 availability of work authorization and eligibility to\n\n18 receive benefits.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"73","file_name":"United States v.

JR.\n\n15 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n16 GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\n17 Justice.\n\n18 First, on standing, I would note that they\n\n19 have no answer to our redressability point. You didn\u0027t\n\n20 hear one today. They don\u0027t have one.\n\n21 Second, even if you think they got over the\n\n22 Article III hurdle, there\u0027s just no way that this\n\n23 license cost injury constitutes something within the\n\n24 zone of interest in any provision within the APA, and\n\n25 they haven\u0027t tried to establish that.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                          \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n   \n\n                         \n\n \n\n                           \n\n86\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 And then third with respect to standing, I\n\n2 think Justice Breyer\u0027s point about the analogy between\n\n3 the kind of theory that they are advocating here and\n\n4 taxpayer standing and parens patriae is dead on correct.\n\n5 This would invite exactly the same kind of flood of\n\n6 litigation that you have always said Article III is\n\n7 designed to prevent, and if you want proof of that, it\n\n8 already exists. Texas is already using this theory to\n\n9 sue the United States based on the resettlement of\n\n10 Syrian refugees in Texas, and that will just be the\n\n11 beginning.\n\n12 Now, Justice Alito, you raised a couple of\n\n13 points I want to get to with some specifics. You asked\n\n14 about whether an employee with a deferred action work\n\n15 authorization could sue if an employer refused to hire.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"86","file_name":"United States v.
