STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 A jurisdictional determination issued by the\n\n12 Army Corps of Engineers is not final agency action\n\n13 because it does not order any person to do or refrain\n\n14 from doing anything and does not alter anyone\u0027s legal\n\n15 rights and obligations. The jurisdictional\n\n16 determination, or JD, expresses the Corps\u0027 opinion about\n\n17 whether a particular tract contains waters protected by\n\n18 the Clean Water Act. That stated opinion may affect the\n\n19 recipient\u0027s assessment of the options available to it,\n\n20 but it does not affect the actual legal status of those\n\n21 options.\n\n22 This Court\u0027s precedents made clear that the\n\n23 practical effects on which Respondents rely are not a\n\n24 sufficient ground for treating an agency communication\n\n25 as final agency action.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                      \n\n         \n\n           \n\n              \n\n         \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n         \n\n             \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n            \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                   \n\n                           \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n           \n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n4\n\n1 Now, the Respondents primarily emphasize the\n\n2 practical impact that the Corps\u0027 jurisdictional\n\n3 determination would have upon themselves, the recipients\n\n4 and the intended audience.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart, may I ask\n\n11 you, please don\u0027t panic by asking this question.\n\nAnd\n\n12 please don\u0027t resist it, because I know all your\n\n13 arguments resisting it.

JUSTICE BREYER: It isn\u0027t just ­­ that\n\n9 isn\u0027t ­­ the issue, I think, is this ­­ what I thought\n\n10 your answer would be is that informal advice is not\n\n11 final Agency action normally.\n\n12 There is a statute. It was passed in 1946.\n\n13 It\u0027s called the Administrative Procedures Act. It tries\n\n14 to divide such things with that word, \"final,\" as\n\n15 rulemaking by the Agency, from accomplishing roughly the\n\n16 same result by never having a rule but just telling\n\n17 everybody informally what the Agency will do in such\n\n18 circumstances. It might be that the formal is, other\n\n19 things being equal, final Agency action in respect to\n\n20 that matter. It might be that the latter is not.\n\n21 So I think what you\u0027re telling me is what I\n\n22 should do next is go read those Federal rules and\n\n23 regulations and see, is this more like informal advice,\n\n24 or is it more like formal rulemaking?

Mr. Hopper was referring to, the Corps\u0027\n\n7 statistics indicate that a little over 50,000 general\n\n8 permit authorizations and a little over 3,000 individual\n\n9 permits are granted each year.\n\n10 The process may be expensive in individual\n\n11 cases, but it is a process that is regularly invoked,\n\n12 and regularly invoked successfully. And in many\n\n13 instances, if the Corps and the landowner come to an\n\n14 agreement, the Corps offers to permit the activity on\n\n15 terms and conditions that the landowner regards as\n\n16 acceptable, that may obviate the need for a court ever\n\n17 to resolve the question of whether these were\n\n18 jurisdictional waters. And that\u0027s the kind of\n\n19 consideration that is often invoked as a justification\n\n20 for not submitting interlocutory review, that the issue\n\n21 on which a person seeks immediate review may turn out\n\n22 not to ­­ to be necessary to resolve after all.\n\n23 With respect to the analogy to district\n\n24 court litigation, I think in Standard Oil, this Court\n\n25 has already taken the step of saying the same principle\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n     \n\n                          \n\n                   \n\n              \n\n                  \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n       \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                            \n\n           \n\n     \n\n              \n\n                       \n\n                  \n\n                          \n\n     \n\n51\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 applies to administrative adjudication.\n\n2 My ­­ my point in analogizing to district\n\n3 court litigation is simply that this is not a quirk of\n\n4 administrative law. This is a fundamental precept of\n\n5 our legal system: That on the whole, we are more\n\n6 worried about piecemeal litigation than about deferred\n\n7 litigation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"48","file_name":"Army Corps of Engineers v.
