ALI\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. ALI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 Johnson is retroactive because it is a rule\n\n12 of substantive criminal law, not a procedural rule that\n\n13 regulates only the manner of determining a defendant\u0027s\n\n14 culpability or sentence. This Court applies a\n\n15 straightforward test for distinguishing between those\n\n16 rules that are procedural and those that are\n\n17 substantive.\n\n18 Assuming perfect trial or sentencing\n\n19 procedures, does the new rule change the authorized\n\n20 outcomes of the criminal process? If no, meaning that a\n\n21 court could have reached the same outcome had it applied\n\n22 perfect procedures, then we\u0027re dealing with a procedural\n\n23 rule.\n\n24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well ­­\n\n25 MR.

Fair notice to the\n\n4 defendant that checks against arbitrary enforcement,\n\n5 those are procedural concerns?\n\n6 MR. ALI: Your Honor, we think under this\n\n7 Court\u0027s decision in Bousley, it\u0027s clear that you don\u0027t\n\n8 look to the source of the rule and that that\u0027s not\n\n9 governing. And what\u0027s relevant here, as it was in\n\n10 relevant ­­ in Bousley is that there was no valid active\n\n11 Congress which authorized the punishment for a class of\n\n12 persons. Here the class of persons who, absent the\n\n13 residual clause, would have two or fewer qualifying\n\n14 crimes under ACCA. In Bousley, the class of persons\n\n15 were those who merely possessed firearms.\n\n16 But to answer your question more directly,\n\n17 Justice Ginsburg, as we explain on page 16, 17 of our\n\n18 reply brief, we think it\u0027s far from clear, even if that\n\n19 were the test, that vagueness sounds only in procedural\n\n20 due process. In fact, it\u0027s qualitatively different, we\n\n21 think, from procedural due process in the sense that it\n\n22 does control or regulate which criminal prescriptions\n\n23 Congress can or cannot pass in a way that we don\u0027t think","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"2","file_name":"Welch v.

ALI: ­­ when you read it with the\n\n2 sentence before ­­ and ­­ and but more fundamentally, I\n\n3 think the answer is that it doesn\u0027t matter because\n\n4 there\u0027s no question that Petitioner is entitled to the\n\n5 benefit of Johnson in this case.\n\n6 JUSTICE ALITO: How can it not matter?\n\n7 You\u0027re arguing that the district judge made a mistake.\n\n8 So your answer is you would have seen it there, and you\n\n9 would be a very prescient district judge. That\u0027s the\n\n10 answer.\n\n11 MR. ALI: Well, Your Honor, my more complete\n\n12 answer is that the questions presented that were drafted\n\n13 in this case and granted about the Court were drafted by\n\n14 a pro se litigant.\n\n15 And I think that taking the two questions\n\n16 together, what those questions ask are: Did the court\n\n17 of appeals err in reversing ­­ or in denying a\n\n18 certificate of appealability? So the first question is\n\n19 referring to, did it err on the basis of the elements\n\n20 clause question. And that raises merely the question of\n\n21 whether reasonable jurists could disagree as to whether\n\n22 Petitioner\u0027s conviction qualified under the elements\n\n23 clause.\n\n24 And the second prong goes to Johnson\u0027s","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"5","file_name":"Welch v.

the government\u0027s view is that a law that\n\n20 invalidates a mandatory minimum punishment within an\n\n21 existing range is a substantive rule because it expands\n\n22 the range of outcomes. May not eliminate the outcome\n\n23 that the defendant actually received, but it does\n\n24 require an expanded range of outcomes, and we regard\n\n25 that as a substantive holding.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                          \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n   \n\n                            \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n                \n\n             \n\n         \n\n                          \n\n           \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n \n\n                     \n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n13\n\n1 But with that caveat, I entirely agree that\n\n2 the basic distinction between substance and procedure is\n\n3 the substantive holding changes the question that the\n\n4 court or the sentencer is answering. It changes it\n\n5 from, in this case, did the defendant have a conviction\n\n6 that qualified under the residual clause, to does he\n\n7 have a conviction that qualifies under the elements\n\n8 clause or the enumerated offense clause only. It ­­ it\n\n9 strikes from the statute a basis ­­ a discrete basis for\n\n10 finding ACCA applicable.\n\n11 And that is, I think, as you correctly point\n\n12 out, Justice Sotomayor, very different from a procedural\n\n13 rule that would say you have to give the defendant 20\n\n14 days\u0027 notice before the defendant litigates this, or the\n\n15 defendant has to be able to introduce certain kinds of\n\n16 evidence in support of the defendant\u0027s claim. But the\n\n17 Court is still answering the very same question: Was\n\n18 there a violent felony under a preexisting definition\n\n19 unaltered by the Court\u0027s new ruling.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"11","file_name":"Welch v.

DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the\n\n8 time of the conviction, he was convicted of strong­arm\n\n9 robbery. And there was an argument that he raises, and\n\n10 continues to raise, that strong­arm robbery doesn\u0027t\n\n11 require, as interpreted by Florida law at the time of\n\n12 his conviction, violent force. This is what the court\n\n13 held is required to satisfy the elements clause in ACCA\n\n14 in the other Johnson case, the Curtis Johnson case.\n\n15 So he argues that violent force wasn\u0027t\n\n16 required; that the Eleventh Circuit looked at some State\n\n17 law precedents and said we\u0027re just not going to decide\n\n18 this issue; it\u0027s easier to resolve under the residual\n\n19 clause. So it remained an open issue under Eleventh\n\n20 Circuit law. And the courts below just haven\u0027t decided\n\n21 it.\n\n22 I think there is a very substantial argument","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"13","file_name":"Welch v.

DREEBEN: It works very differently,\n\n22 Justice Ginsburg. To get certified for filing of a\n\n23 second or successive 2255 motion, a defendant has to go\n\n24 to the court of appeals and request authorization and\n\n25 receive it under 2255(h).

So it requires a ruling from this Court\n\n4 that the ruling that\u0027s relied upon is retroactive.\n\n5 And the courts of appeals have split,\n\n6 methodologically and substantively, on whether this\n\n7 Court has made Johnson retroactive.\n\n8 To be very brief about it, the government\u0027s\n\n9 position is that this Court has done so through a\n\n10 combination of holdings. It\u0027s a syllogism. All\n\n11 substantive rules are retroactive; Johnson is a\n\n12 substantive rule; therefore, this Court\u0027s jurisprudence\n\n13 makes Johnson retroactive.\n\n14 But that has occasioned substantial\n\n15 disagreement in the courts of appeals. Unfortunately,\n\n16 Congress precluded certiorari review in the AEDPA, so\n\n17 this Court cannot directly review that conflict.\n\n18 If the Court in this case were to hold that","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"15","file_name":"Welch v.

So all the late Chief Justice Rehnquist\n\n4 said there, writing for the Court, is that when this\n\n5 Court interprets a statute, we are outside the Teague\n\n6 framework entirely. And there, of course, the Court\n\n7 hadn\u0027t even reversed itself on the statutory question.\n\n8 So there wasn\u0027t even a new statutory issue there.\n\n9 When the court says what a statute\n\n10 definitively means, it is making a judicial\n\n11 determination that the conduct at issue falls\n\n12 definitively outside the scope of the relevant statute.\n\n13 Here, precisely because Johnson said that the clause was\n\n14 hopelessly indeterminant, we can\u0027t know with certainty\n\n15 that everybody\u0027s conduct fell outside the clause.
