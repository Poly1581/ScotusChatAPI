SHELLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 There are at least three reasons why the\n\n11 Court should adopt what the courts of appeals have\n\n12 called the per­prisoner approach under PLRA\n\n13 Section 1915(b)(2).\n\n14 One, the per­prisoner approach best comports\n\n15 with the statutory text.\n\n16 Two, the per­prisoner approach is the only\n\n17 one consistent with the careful balance Congress struck\n\n18 between deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits and\n\n19 preserving their right to bring meritorious ones.\n\n20 And three, the per­prisoner approach avoids\n\n21 anomalies and disincentives that Congress could never\n\n22 have intended, disincentives such as discouraging\n\n23 prisoner work by taking one hundred percent of their\n\n24 income month after month.\n\n25 I would like to, of course, start with the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                      \n\n              \n\n              \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                          \n\n                       \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n           \n\n                           \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n                      \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                            \n\nOfficial\n\n4\n\n1 text.

One is that there\u0027s nothing in the\n\n5 statute that suggests that you would delay the payments.\n\n6 And it doesn\u0027t make sense in terms of the statutory\n\n7 purpose to delay them.\n\n8 As Judge Easterbrook\u0027s opinion for the\n\n9 Seventh Circuit said, if you want to have a\n\n10 pay­as­you­go system where there\u0027s an immediate cost to\n\n11 each individual case, the person needs to have an\n\n12 obligation to start paying right away, not five years in\n\n13 the future, or perhaps never.\n\n14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he pays the 20\n\n15 percent in every case right away.\n\n16 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. But that\u0027s a one­time\n\n17 payment, and it could be quite small. And that\u0027s very\n\n18 different from having an ongoing monthly payment that\n\n19 starts right away and that you have to pay.\n\n20 But I do want to address another ­­ another\n\n21 point that I think your question raised, which is are\n\n22 prisoners ever going to be paying these amounts,\n\n23 particularly where they have filed numerous cases like\n\n24 the individual in this case. And I think the answer is\n\n25 no, for two reasons. The first is a practical one.

One of those problems ­­ when you ­­ when\n\n3 you look at the statute, Subsection (b) allows you to\n\n4 take money from the trust accounts, so it\u0027s fairly easy\n\n5 to collect while the

So to think that\n\n15 potentially paying five years down the road, or never\n\n16 paying is any kind of marginal deterrent I think would\n\n17 be wrong.\n\n18 We think that Congress knew that there were\n\n19 multiple filers out there, and that if they were going\n\n20 to file more lawsuits, they should pay more. And just\n\n21 to be clear about what Congress was saying here, no one\n\n22 is precluded from going to court.

we think that that makes\n\n2 complete sense.\n\n3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Saharsky, can I get back\n\n4 to the $10 rule and the BOP policy with respect to this?\n\n5 I think it was the Chief Justice who said that he didn\u0027t\n\n6 really understand. And I share his lack of\n\n7 understanding about how the BOP is actually doing this,\n\n8 given the language of the statute.\n\n9 The statute says, you know, \"shall forward\n\n10 payments each time the amount in the account exceeds\n\n11 $10.\" So that suggests to me that if you\u0027re looking at\n\n12 an account with $10 and 1 cent, you make the next\n\n13 payment. And I understand from your brief that that\u0027s\n\n14 not what the BOP is doing. And how can the BOP be not\n\n15 doing that?\n\n16 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, a ­­ a couple of\n\n17 answers.

SHELLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n6 First of all, with respect to the ­­ the\n\n7 hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor asked, in fact, I\n\n8 think if the account had $11 in it, the government\u0027s\n\n9 position would lead to none of the clerks of the courts\n\n10 being paid because the first payment would take the ­­\n\n11 the balance under $10. So that seems, again, as a\n\n12 number of justices have mentioned, other than\n\n13 Justice Breyer, a perverse reading of the $10 rule.\n\n14 But I also want to take on the idea that\n\n15 this is the only provision in the statute that provides\n\n16 for a financial effect on the prisoner when filing a\n\n17 lawsuit. No ­­ as the Chief Justice mentioned, the\n\n18 initial partial filing fee applies in every case. No\n\n19 $10 rule. No minimum.\n\n20 So that is a ­­ an immediate financial\n\n21 incentive not to file a frivolous lawsuit because money\n\n22 is going to go immediately. And if it doesn\u0027t go\n\n23 immediately, it\u0027s a debt that gets paid sequentially,\n\n24 much like the per­prisoner approach would adopt for\n\n25 (b)(2).

Ms. Saharsky mentioned the word \"fees,\"\n\n7 but \"fees\" unadorned with the word \"filing\" in front of\n\n8 it appears differently than does the word \"filing fees.\"\n\n9 The plural \"filing fees\" appears in exactly\n\n10 two spots: (b)(2). And then in the cross­reference to\n\n11 the cost section, I believe it\u0027s (f) ­­ in the (f)\n\n12 section where it says that costs shall be charged the\n\n13 same way as filing fees. They both use the plural\n\n14 \"filing fees.\"\n\n15 So this was purposeful. Congress used the\n\n16 plural \"filing fees\" only twice.
