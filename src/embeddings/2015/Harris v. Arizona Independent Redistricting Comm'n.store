necessary to obtain preclearance are\n\n5 legitimate, but you can\u0027t go ­­ but they went further.\n\n6 They ­­ they went beyond what was really necessary to\n\n7 obtain preclearance, so we would have to determine\n\n8 whether that was true or not, or some court would have\n\n9 to determine whether that was true or not.\n\n10 MR. BRNOVICH: In this instance, because of\n\n11 the systematic way the deviations, the under­population\n\n12 occurred, as well as the intention ­­ we know from the\n\n13 Independent Redistricting Commission that they\n\n14 intentionally under­populated those districts. So we\n\n15 have all that evidence.\n\n16 However, we do believe that the Voting\n\n17 Rights Act is like any other criteria. So if you get\n\n18 these population deviations and they\u0027re incidental, not\n\n19 intentional ­­ and that is the key, I believe, is when\n\n20 you intentionally under­populate and systemically\n\n21 under­populate these districts ­­ that\u0027s what causes the\n\n22 constitutional harm.\n\n23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the only way\n\n24 that you ­­ that a State could obtain preclearance when","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"19","file_name":"Harris v.
