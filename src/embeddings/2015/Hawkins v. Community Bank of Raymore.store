The only\n\n17 thing that could be declared unenforceable would be the\n\n18 spousal guaranties which are deemed illegal under\n\n19 Regulation B. Not all of the guarantors can bring a\n\n20 claim. The husbands can only bring a claim to the\n\n21 extent they suffer damage as a result of their wives\n\n22 being required to be guarantors on the case.\n\n23 Mr. Chief Justice, I see that my time is\n\n24 limited.

That\n\n12 longstanding regulation is reasonable, and it reflects a\n\n13 reasonable interpretation of the Act\u0027s broad definition\n\n14 of the term \"applicant.\"\n\n15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we\u0027ve been\n\n16 talking about applicants ­­ is it ­­ is the person an\n\n17 applicant in the abstract? But one of the important\n\n18 things about context here is there are two terms,\n\n19 \"applicant\" and \"guarantor.\" And that\u0027s the way it\u0027s\n\n20 always worked in the industry. Somebody in the industry\n\n21 would not call a guarantor an applicant. The person is\n\n22 a guarantor. So I just wonder how we can pluck\n\n23 \"applicant\" out. Obviously, in some sense, anybody who\n\n24 is supporting the loan, you know, you can describe,\n\n25 well, they\u0027re applying for it.

were unambiguously excluded by\n\n19 the statute or that it was rewriting the statute. It\n\n20 did that because between 1977 and 1985, the Agency\u0027s own\n\n21 regulation had expressly said that applicants do not\n\n22 include guarantors, cosigners, and other similar\n\n23 parties.

So in ­­ in a common case,\n\n21 the lender says, I won\u0027t extend this loan without a\n\n22 signature from your spouse. And everyone agrees that\n\n23 that\u0027s a violation of Regulation B, and everyone agrees\n\n24 that that\u0027s not permitted.\n\n25 And if, in that case, the spouse provides\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n            \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                         \n\n             \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n           \n\n                       \n\n                          \n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the signature, as often happens, then the primary\n\n2 applicant, the borrower, hasn\u0027t suffered any harm at\n\n3 all.

So the way the statute is\n\n18 intended to work, and works just fine with the\n\n19 definition of applicant we use, is to say when that\n\n20 person shows up, and the bank says, oh, no credit for\n\n21 you unless a spouse signs, the violation has occurred\n\n22 then. And the discrimination is against the person who\n\n23 wanted to borrow the money.

So the question I think is, like, why should\n\n12 that be, you know ­­ just because it\u0027s to a third party,\n\n13 the appeal, the request to the application is as to a\n\n14 third party rather than to yourself, why that should\n\n15 make any difference if the question is just what does\n\n16 applicant mean?

But what that opens\n\n20 the door to, Your Honor, is there have been 60 or 70\n\n21 reported ECOA decisions since the change in 1985. More\n\n22 than half of those are within the last five years.\n\n23 After the 2008 crash, massive defaults, this is coming\n\n24 up more and more for banks as a defense.\n\n25 And if I can just have one minute, I\u0027ll tell\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                      \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                      \n\n                   \n\n                              \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                              \n\n                   \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\n1 you where this leads for banks.

DUGGAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n10 and may it please the Court:\n\n11 I think the primary answer to talk about, to\n\n12 start with, is these guaranties are not simply\n\n13 guaranties of the performance of the borrower. They are\n\n14 separate, independent performance required by the\n\n15 guarantor under the guaranty. The guarantor must pay\n\n16 its creditors on time. The guarantor must provide\n\n17 financial statements to the lender. The guarantor must\n\n18 fulfill all other obligations and any other agreement\n\n19 that the guarantor has with the lender. If the\n\n20 guarantor fails to perform any one of those single,\n\n21 independent requirements of performance under the\n\n22 guaranty, the guarantor agrees to repay the debt in\n\n23 full. There is separate performance under the guaranty.\n\n24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you ask ­­ could you\n\n25 respond to counsel\u0027s last point?
