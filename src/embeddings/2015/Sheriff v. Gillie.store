MURPHY\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. MURPHY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 Given resource constraints, Ohio law has\n\n12 always authorized its attorney general to appoint\n\n13 special counsel to undertake the attorney general\u0027s\n\n14 duty of representing the State in the courts. While\n\n15 the attorney general may appoint general deputies\n\n16 today, special counsel remain integral to the\n\n17 office.

Like the SG statute to\n\n10 help the ­­ assist the attorney general engage in\n\n11 his duties, that\u0027s exactly what this statute says.\n\n12 R.C. 109.08 says the attorney general may appoint\n\n13 special counsel to assist in the ­­ or to represent\n\n14 the State in the collections of these debts.\n\n15 So they say it doesn\u0027t even list the duty.\n\n16 I think it lists the precise duty that special\n\n17 counsel are to undertake.\n\n18 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess the question is\n\n19 whether it needs to more authorize an office.

MURPHY: You have to remember that\n\n6 these are lawyers.\n\nAnd how the process works is at\n\n7 JA 124 to 130, and let me just explain it briefly.\n\n8 It starts in­house. In­house employees of\n\n9 the office will send letters for most debts on our\n\n10 own letterhead in an attempt to collect in­house.\n\n11 When that proves unsuccessful, we go to third­party\n\n12 vendors, which are essentially collections\n\n13 associations which were the historically reason for\n\n14 this Act. They\u0027re not lawyers; they\u0027re collections\n\n15 associations. They send letters and make phone\n\n16 calls. And that\u0027s basically what they do.\n\n17 And that\u0027s the second step.

But Steele also makes quite clear that\n\n17 deputy collectors of customs would be officers\n\n18 because that\u0027s a situation where the superior\n\n19 officer is actually delegating his authority

And I think\n\n21 that\u0027s the symmetry that matters here.\n\n22 JUSTICE KAGAN: That seems ­­ if I\n\n23 understood you correctly, that seems an odd line to\n\n24 draw.

Let me just turn\n\n9 to what the recipient of this letter thinks.\n\n10 Just common, everyday experience, when you\n\n11 receive a letter that says at the letterhead \"Office\n\n12 of the Attorney General,\" you think that the source\n\n13 of the letter is coming from someone within the\n\n14 attorney general\u0027s office.\n\n15 JUSTICE KAGAN: I\u0027m not sure what\n\n16 difference it makes. I mean, it seems to me that a\n\n17 letter like this gives you two kinds of information.\n\n18 One is it says \"You owe some sum of money to the\n\n19 State,\" and that\u0027s perfectly true.

ROSENCRANZ: Your Honor, the ­­ a\n\n6 central premise of this statute, as I said at the\n\n7 outset, is to distinguish in­house creditors from\n\n8 outside creditors. Why? Because outside creditors\n\n9 were the ones who were guilty of the worst abuses.\n\n10 Outside creditors were the ones who misled, and\n\n11 Congress was trying to make sure that when the\n\n12 consumer is talking to a debt collector, they knew\n\n13 who they were precisely because the reputational\n\n14 interests of the attorney general\u0027s office are\n\n15 guarded by people within the attorney general\u0027s\n\n16 office in a way that debt collectors don\u0027t\n\n17 necessarily guard the interests of the attorney\n\n18 general\u0027s office. And an in­house ­­\n\n19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think ­­ I would\n\n20 think that that would be a reason for using the ­­\n\n21 the heading, because now the ­­ the Ohio Attorney\n\n22 General is responsible for all the actions that this\n\n23 debt collector is going to take.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n15 Just a few points.\n\n16 First, going to Justice Kagan\u0027s question, I\n\n17 really think they are turning a virtue into a vice\n\n18 here. They\u0027re flipping the Act on its head. If\n\n19 you ­­ if you look at the tax statute that requires\n\n20 the AG to give this letterhead to special counsel\n\n21 for tax debts, the very next provision ­­ the very\n\n22 next provision of that Act, which was known as the\n\n23 Taxpayer Bill of Rights, the very next provision of\n\n24 that Act requires the AG to appoint problem\n\n25 resolution officers to handle complaints by debtors\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n \n\n                        \n\n                    \n\n \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                           \n\n                   \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                       \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n60\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 about special counsel or the employee assigned to\n\n2 the case.\n\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do they know who to\n\n4 call?\n\n5 MR.
