SCHMIDT: Justice Sotomayor, and that\u0027s\n\n4 the second reason we would respectfully ask this Court\n\n5 to reverse the Kansas Court, in addition to the\n\n6 bright­line per se rule.\n\n7 The Kansas Court reported it said it was\n\n8 applying this Court\u0027s instruction from Boyde v.\n\n9 California to test whether or not the Eighth Amendment\n\n10 is offended by instructions that are alleged to be\n\n11 ambiguous or confusing, which I think is what\u0027s\n\n12 happening there.\n\n13 The Kansas Court said it was applying Boyde,\n\n14 but then it went on to conduct no actual Boyde analysis\n\n15 other than what Your Honor points to, which is simply\n\n16 the State said repeatedly, in both cases, that there is\n\n17 a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\n18 State must prove with respect to aggravators, and also\n\n19 with respect to the weighing factor.\n\n20 And the mere silence on the other side\n\n21 somehow led the Kansas Court to conclude that Boyde was\n\n22 violated because jurors would have inferred what was\n\n23 imposed on the State must also have been imposed on the\n\n24 Respondent. I just don\u0027t think that follows either\n\n25 logic or natural language.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                         \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n     \n\n                       \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n           \n\n             \n\n     \n\n          \n\n                         \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n        \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n           \n\n               \n\n20\n\nOfficial\n\n1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I think what","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"16","file_name":"Kansas v.

SCHMIDT: Justice Sotomayor, I certainly\n\n7 agree that is what they seem to be saying, but the test\n\n8 this Court has adopted and applied repeatedly since\n\n9 Boyde is not that there is some speculative possibility\n\n10 in a hypothetical circumstance somebody might have been\n\n11 confused. It is there is a showing, that there is a\n\n12 reasonable likelihood that these jurors applied their\n\n13 instructions in a way that prevented them from\n\n14 considering constitutionally relevant mitigation\n\n15 evidence. There\u0027s no showing of it.\n\n16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is such common sense\n\n17 that there is a maxim of interpretation that invokes it.\n\n18 When ­­ when somebody says interest­free loans for\n\n19 people with good credit, it implies that there are not\n\n20 interest­free loans for people who don\u0027t have good\n\n21 credit. Inclusio unius, exclusio alterius.\n\n22 And if one says there are aggravating\n\n23 factors and mitigating factors, and you must prove the\n\n24 aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, the\n\n25 normal understanding is you don\u0027t have to prove it\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n                          \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n         \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                     \n\n                        \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                           \n\n               \n\n               \n\n             \n\n \n\n                          \n\n                \n\n         \n\n           \n\n             \n\n              \n\n21\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"17","file_name":"Kansas v.

has\n\n2 said repeatedly in Abdul­Kabir and in Braverman that the\n\n3 mere presentation of evidence is enough. The evidence\n\n4 has to be given full effect as a mitigating\n\n5 circumstance.\n\n6 And I understand that different people can\n\n7 look at this ­­ these set of instructions as a whole and\n\n8 come up with different ways of interpreting them. But\n\n9 this Court\u0027s decision in Boyde says as long as there is\n\n10 a reasonable likelihood that a jury could read them in a\n\n11 confusing way and bar the consideration of mitigating\n\n12 evidence, that is enough.\n\n13 Now, Justice Scalia, you said, well, that\n\n14 doesn\u0027t square with common sense. What about an example\n\n15 like, quote, \"interest­free loans for people with good\n\n16 credit\"?\n\n17 Now, our argument is not simply that the\n\n18 jury instruction said beyond a reasonable doubt, though\n\n19 they did 9 times. It\u0027s that they coupled the beyond a\n\n20 reasonable doubt with the language found to exist, that\n\n21 mitigating circumstances must be found to exist 9 times.\n\n22 And so, Justice Scalia ­­\n\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you say\n\n24 something ­­ if you\u0027re considering whether to retire,\n\n25 you said you should be absolutely sure you have enough\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                   \n\n       \n\n                   \n\n                       \n\n                   \n\n                           \n\n               \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n         \n\n                          \n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\n1 money to live on and you ought to think about whether","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"46","file_name":"Kansas v.

Here, our\n\n12 point is that the instructions themselves injected the\n\n13 confusion.

The point is here they mentioned only\n\n16 one standard, beyond a reasonable doubt. They mentioned\n\n17 it 9 times. And they said that the mitigating\n\n18 circumstances had to be found to exist.\n\n19 If the jury interpreted it this way, then\n\n20 this Court ­­ then the Court would be blessing a jury\n\n21 instruction on beyond a reasonable doubt for the first\n\n22 time ever in its history that said that a jury, all 12\n\n23 of them, might have believed mitigating circumstances\n\n24 actually existed and could not give it effect.

I\n\n6 mean, indeed, I\u0027m not aware of a single State that does\n\n7 so. There\u0027s no amici on the State\u0027s side saying that\n\n8 this is going to impose any sort of harm to them. This\n\n9 is the most modest fix in the world. It could be done\n\n10 not just with an affirmative instruction, it could be\n\n11 done by just striking out the words \"found to exist\" out\n\n12 of the jury instructions.\n\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you think\n\n14 the jury ­­ if you ­­ are they supposed to consider\n\n15 things they didn\u0027t find to exist?\n\n16 MR.

Mr. Chief Justice, I\u0027m anxious\n\n21 on the point.\n\nThank you.\n\n22 Two or three points as time allows,\n\n23 Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n24 First on Mr. Katyal\u0027s point that the issue\n\n25 here is the how and not the what. I would come back to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                   \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                      \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                                \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                            \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n                \n\n           \n\n                             \n\n            \n\n \n\n57\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the point that there was both a catch­all and a mercy\n\n2 instruction here. And I would further point this Court\n\n3 to what this Court has suggested in the past.\n\n4 This Court has fairly consistently suggested\n\n5 that the cure to a Lockett type of error, that there was\n\n6 something presented that might not have been able to be\n\n7 given effect, would be catch­all or mercy types of\n\n8 instructions.\n\n9 And I would refer you to pages 310 and 11 of\n\n10 Penry 1 where it wasn\u0027t the Court, but it was defense\n\n11 who requested a mercy instruction that was not granted.\n\n12 And as a result, the case wound up in front of this\n\n13 Court.\n\n14 But also suggest that you look at page 803\n\n15 on Penry 2 where this Court suggested ­­\n\n16 Justice O\u0027Connor writing ­­ that a catch­all instruction\n\n17 well­crafted would have been the cure for the error this\n\n18 Court found in Penry 2.\n\n19 A similar implication at page 242 in\n\n20 Abdul­Kabir, and a similar implication in page 308 of\n\n21 Blystone.
