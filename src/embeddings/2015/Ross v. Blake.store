BERNHARDT: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n9 Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:\n\n10 In this case, the Fourth Circuit adopted a\n\n11 nontextual exception to the requirement of the\n\n12 Prison Litigation Reform Act that a prisoner exhaust\n\n13 available administrative remedies. That exception,\n\n14 if accepted, would eviscerate Congress\u0027s intent in\n\n15 adopting the Prison Litigation Reform Act and\n\n16 requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n\n17 In the Fourth Circuit States where this\n\n18 exception now applies, district courts are now\n\n19 charged with examining prison procedures to see how\n\n20 murky they are. They are dispensing with the\n\n21 requirement of exhaustion at all if there\u0027s been an\n\n22 internal investigation ­­\n\n23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Bernhardt, could I just\n\n24 ask you to talk about the procedures?
