JAFFE\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. JAFFE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 This case presents two questions concerning\n\n12 the consequences of the failure to object or raise an\n\n13 issue at trial.\n\n14 On the question of whether jury instructions\n\n15 not objected to by the government become the baseline\n\n16 for measuring the sufficiency of the evidence at later\n\n17 stages in the case, the critical point here is that only\n\n18 the jury can determine that a defendant is guilty. And\n\n19 if a jury does so under a particular framework, it\n\n20 should be evaluated under that framework. And if it\n\n21 cannot sustain that verdict on the reasons it used in\n\n22 its own deliberations, that verdict is not rational.\n\n23 In ­­\n\n24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there ­­ there\u0027s ­­\n\n25 there\u0027s no doubt in this case, is there, that the jury\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n             \n\n                             \n\n              \n\n             \n\n         \n\n                         \n\n                       \n\n                           \n\n           \n\n                   \n\n                       \n\n                       \n\n                             \n\n                       \n\n \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n         \n\n                           \n\n         \n\n                              \n\n                   \n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had\n\n2 committed a crime set forth in the indictment?\n\n3 MR.

MARTINEZ: Mr. Chief Justice, I think ­­\n\n6 in a case like that, I think the ­­ the proper way to\n\n7 analyze that case would be the way you would analyze any\n\n8 case where the ­­ the root error is an instructional\n\n9 error. And ­­ and you would look to that, and if you\n\n10 thought it was prejudicial, you might remand the case\n\n11 or ­­ or vacate the conviction but allow for a new\n\n12 trial.\n\n13 But that\u0027s not what Petitioner is asking","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"37","file_name":"Musacchio v.

Virginia talks from a jury­centric perspective.\n\nThe\n\n15 issue is not the statute.\n\nThe issue is whether a\n\n16 rational jury could have done what they did. And that\n\n17 only works if you look at the instructions. It does not\n\n18 work if you look at some hypothetical statute that they\n\n19 didn\u0027t think they were applying. They thought they were\n\n20 doing something different.\n\n21 Third, their objection that we ­­ we\n\n22 acknowledged that this was only about unauthorized\n\n23 access is curious because he cites the appellate stuff\n\n24 where there was new counsel, yet his own side\u0027s briefs\n\n25 at the trial level recognized that trial counsel was\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                      \n\n           \n\n               \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n     \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n          \n\n                \n\n     \n\n                              \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n             \n\n       \n\n                        \n\n                   \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\n1 confused.\n\n2 Yes, after that confusion was resolved\n\n3 post­verdict, we argued.

really the issue.\n\nThe\n\n17 law­of­the­case cases don\u0027t really apply because they\u0027re\n\n18 misnamed.\n\n19 Turning to the statute of limitations, what\n\n20 I\u0027d say is this: There is error when something is\n\n21 contrary to law whether or not it was the judge\u0027s\n\n22 obligation to raise that. The Apprendi ­­ the\n\n23 post­Apprendi cases are the best examples of this. The\n\n24 judge is applying pre­Apprendi law. It did not make a\n\n25 mistake. We\u0027re not expected to anticipate Apprendi.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n       \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                \n\n     \n\n                       \n\n           \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                       \n\n                  \n\n64\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Yet on appeal those cases were considered erroneous\n\n2 because this Court adopted Apprendi.\n\n3 Again, it is not about whether you made an\n\n4 objection or whether the Court should have thought of it\n\n5 themselves. It is about the merits of the result, and\n\n6 in this instance, we claim the statute of limitations\n\n7 was violated. That is the error regardless of who\n\n8 needed to raise it.\n\n9 Talking about raising the issue: Again,\n\n10 calling the statute of limitations the affirmative\n\n11 defense is a little misleading. It is not an\n\n12 affirmative defense. One has to plead it. One ­­ but\n\n13 the government has to actually prove that they satisfy\n\n14 it. It is a hybrid kind of creature, and Cook and those\n\n15 cases deal with pleading because they wanted the\n\n16 government to have the opportunity to respond.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"61","file_name":"Musacchio v.
