STEELEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSection 301(b)(1)(C) of the Clean\n\nWater Act assigns EPA the job of setting the\n\neffluent limitations necessary to meet and\n\nimplement water quality standards.  The water\n\nquality standards are not the limitations\n\nthemselves.  Instead, they set the goals for the\n\nwater body.  EPA must translate those goals into\n\ndischarge limitations.\n\nThe Generic Prohibitions fail this\n\ntask. As Judge Collins explained below, the\n\nGeneric Prohibitions erase the distinction\n\nbetween water quality standards and discharge\n\nlimitations, making them one and the same.\n\nThe Generic Prohibitions revive the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nvery \"cause or contribute\" standard Congress\n\nrepealed.  And they do not function as discharge\n\nlimitations.  As the Second Circuit recognized,\n\nthey add nothing that tells a permitholder how\n\nto control its discharges.\n\nEPA claims it uses the Generic\n\nProhibitions as a backstop, an insurance policy\n\nagainst changing circumstances.  But the Clean\n\nWater Act already gives EPA all the tools it\n\nneeds to address uncertainty.  EPA can reopen,\n\nmodify, or terminate a permit when conditions\n\nchange, and it can exercise its statutory\n\nauthority to protect public welfare in\n\nemergencies.  What EPA cannot do is expose\n\npermitholders to liability based on receiving","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"2","file_name":"San Francisco v.

And then,\n\nwhen you look at the control sewer overflow\n\ncontrol policy -- or the Combined Sewer Overflow\n\nControl Policy, that policy, I think, the\n\nlongstanding policy of the agency, was to\n\ninclude these generic kinds of -- what you call\n\ngeneric kinds of limitations.\n\nI mean, it\u0027s very explicit in the\n\npolicy. It says the authority should at least\n\nrequire permittees to comply with the applicable\n\nwater quality standards.  And, apparently, EPA\n\nhad guidance that said it didn\u0027t matter whether\n\nthis was Phase I or Phase II; these kinds of\n\npermitting conditions we\u0027re going to put in our\n\npermits.\n\nSo how can it be, given the amendment\n\nhere, that Congress did not intend for these\n\nkinds of provisions to exist in permits?\n\nMS. STEELEY: So there\u0027s nothing in\n\nthe policy that authorizes the Generic\n\nProhibitions.  What Congress was authorizing is\n\nthat EPA set limitations in a permit that\n\nrequire our compliance with water quality\n\nstandards.  They can do that through effluent\n\nlimitations.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nSan Francisco\u0027s opening brief makes\n\none and only one argument, that Section\n\n1311(b)(1)(C) authorizes only effluent\n\nlimitations.  This Court, however, already\n\nrejected that argument in National Association\n\nof Manufacturers.
