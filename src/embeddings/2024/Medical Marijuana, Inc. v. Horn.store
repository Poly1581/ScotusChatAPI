ANAND: Sure, Your Honor.  So I\n\nthink our -- the two best points for us.\n\nThe first is how the Restatement\n\nprovision talks about fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, and it says:  Any pecuniary\n\nloss occasioned by reasonable reliance on the\n\nmisrepresentation is usually recoverable.\n\nAnd so we think, here, that\u0027s exactly\n\nwhat happened.  In reasonable reliance on\n\nPetitioners\u0027 misrepresentation, we took this\n\ndrug. The foreseeable consequence is that we\n\ngot fired.\n\nThe second is a sort of factual point.\n\nRemember, it\u0027s not just about general\n\nmisrepresentations on YouTube and on the\n\nwebsite.  Ms. Harp-Horn called Customer Service,\n\nsays: I\u0027m a trucker.  Can you promise me this\n\ndoesn\u0027t have THC?

think there\u0027s a response to the fact that\n\nthe other side is reading this as any person\n\ninjured in his person, business, or property can\n\nrecover three times the economic damages.  So\n\nthey\u0027re adding the word \"injury,\" a personal\n\ninjury, to the injury requirement, and they\u0027re\n\nadding the economic restriction to the damages.\n\nIt completely flips this statute on its head.\n\nAnd this is the way the Clayton Act has been\n\nread since eternity, that personal injuries are\n\nnot recoverable.\n\nOn the consequences, we cite, I think\n\non page 27, this case, Hopp.  It involves a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n84\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nboxer.
