I view that as\n\ndifferent as the state setting up its judicial\n\nsystem to direct courts -- parties to a\n\nthird-party neutral.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if,\n\ninstead of the requirement you\u0027re complaining --\n\nthe exhaustion requirement, what if the\n\nrequirement were simply that parties had to go\n\nthrough a mediation process?\n\nI think several jurisdictions have\n\nthat. I mean, it may -- it may not last long,\n\nbut before you can proceed with your suit, you\n\nhave to sit down, and there\u0027s a mediator that\n\nsees -- tries to see if you can work it out.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"4","file_name":"Williams v.

UNIKOWSKY:  That\u0027s right.  So this\n\nCourt has upheld some jurisdictional rules and\n\nstruck down others, and we\u0027re happy to talk\n\nabout those cases.\n\nSo, in Howlett and most recently in\n\nHaywood, this Court held that jurisdictional\n\nrules were preempted, and in both those cases,\n\nthe -- the rule of decision was that the state\n\ncourts in general hear 1983 claims and the state\n\ncourts sometimes hear claims against these\n\nparticular defendants, and so the state cannot\n\navoid preemption just by defining the\n\njurisdiction of the state courts to exclude\n\ncases where this defense is asserted.\n\nAnd, in fact, in the Howlett case,\n\nthere\u0027s actually this language that says that\n\nFelder would not have come out the other way if\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n23\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nWisconsin had said that state courts lack\n\njurisdiction over claims in which the notice of\n\nclaim requirement wasn\u0027t satisfied.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in Haywood, the\n\ncourts -- the Court concluded that the New York\n\nrule evinced hostility toward 1983.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"20","file_name":"Williams v.

And\n\nthat holding would avoid looking at the facts of\n\nthis particular case.\n\nAnd I think the Court could reach that\n\nconclusion by comparing the time limits here to\n\nthe time limits in Felder.  So, in Felder, the\n\nCourt held that the statute undermines Section\n\n1983 because the claimant only had 120 days to\n\nbring the suit, and, therefore, the practical\n\neffect of the notice of claim statute was to\n\nimmunize the state against many types of 1983\n\nclaims.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd so I think, you know, this case,\n\nthe time limits are actually much shorter.
