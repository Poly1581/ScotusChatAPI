The court below\n\ncorrectly rejected Petitioner\u0027s claims on\n\nadequate and independent state grounds, that he\n\nfailed to show reasonable diligence or clear and\n\nconvincing evidence of innocence.\n\nThe attorney general did not waive\n\nthose bars in this case, and the court was free\n\nto apply them in any event.  This Court should\n\naccordingly dismiss the case for lack of\n\njurisdiction, leaving Petitioner free to pursue\n\nstate law clemency or other available relief.\n\nIf the Court reaches the merits, it\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"65","file_name":"Glossip v.

The cryptic note does not\n\nestablish any of the threshold elements of\n\nPetitioner\u0027s claim, and perhaps, most clearly,\n\nthe note is immaterial because it adds nothing\n\nof substance to what Petitioner already knew.\n\nCritically, Petitioner has known since\n\nhe received the competency report in 1997 that\n\nJustin Sneed took lithium and had a mental\n\nillness, but Petitioner chose not to question\n\nSneed\u0027s mental health at the trial because he\n\nknew that doing so would reinforce the\n\nprosecution\u0027s theory that Sneed was vulnerable\n\nto his manipulation.\n\nNothing in the note would have changed\n\nthat decision or the jury\u0027s, particularly\n\nconsidering the extensive other evidence against\n\nPetitioner, including his motive to commit the\n\ncrime and his coverup of the body.\n\nThe parties rely heavily on the\n\nattorney general\u0027s confession of error, but\n\ncourts, not executives, determine whether to\n\nvacate final judgments of conviction.  The court\n\nhere decided the case on the law and the facts.\n\nThis Court cannot ask for any more than that.\n\nIt should leave the conviction in place.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n72\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"66","file_name":"Glossip v.

squarely addressed what to\n\ndo with that, and that\u0027s the decision on the\n\nfourth post-conviction review application, in\n\nwhich the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, on\n\npage JA 775, said that it was not going to\n\naccept the attorney general\u0027s waiver of the\n\nprocedural bars.\n\nThe attorney general -- in this Court,\n\nHeritage Reporting

after he received that\n\ndecision from the Oklahoma Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals, did not actually waive the procedural\n\nbar in this case.\n\nInstead, if you look at JA 976 and\n\n977, the attorney general says, \"What Glossip\n\nhas to do is meet the procedural bar.\"  Then he\n\ngoes on to describe the diligence prong and the\n\ninnocence prong and why, in the attorney\n\ngeneral\u0027s legal

That\u0027s probably the\n\nissue that comes up the most in the closing\n\narguments, which are not evidence but are a\n\nreflection of what was at issue in the trial.\n\nAnd, therefore, Petitioner\u0027s strategic\n\ndecision in this case not to question Sneed\u0027s\n\nmental illness, I think, was informed by the\n\nfact that he didn\u0027t want to support the\n\nprosecution\u0027s theory.\n\nAnd, as this Court explained, for\n\nexample, in Wood versus Bartholomew, you can\n\ninfer from the -- the strategic decisions of the\n\ndefendant what was material, what was important\n\nin the case.\n\nIf the defendant himself, who has\n\nevery incentive to raise the arguments that are\n\nbest for him, doesn\u0027t want to raise arguments\n\nabout Sneed\u0027s mental health, that is a strong\n\nclue, a strong indicator that it\u0027s not material,\n\nat least material in the sense that it would\n\nchange the result in his favor. It may have\n\nmade the conviction more likely, but, of course,\n\nthat\u0027s not what he needs to show for\n\nmateriality.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n106\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Would have made","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"98","file_name":"Glossip v.
