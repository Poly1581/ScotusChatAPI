BLATT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMS. BLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nFor over a century, this Court has\n\nheld that the default standard in civil cases is\n\npreponderance of the evidence.  That default\n\nrule should resolve this case.  Nothing in the\n\ntext suggests that Congress intended a clear and\n\nconvincing evidence standard to apply to the 34\n\nexemptions under the Fair Labor Standard -- Fair\n\nLabor Standards Act.\n\nRespondent -- Respondents argue that a\n\nheightened standard is appropriate because FLSA\n\nrights are important.  But a preponderance\n\nstandard applies to rights against race\n\ndiscrimination and disability discrimination and\n\nrights to organize and to workplace safety, all\n\nsuper-important rights.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nThis Court has reserved the clear and\n\nconvincing standard to deprivations by the\n\ngovernment of critical rights that don\u0027t involve\n\nmoney damages.  This Court has never allowed\n\nplaintiffs to use a clear and convincing\n\nstandard as a sword, and it certainly has never\n\nread a clear and convincing standard into a\n\nstatute for money damages.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"2","file_name":"E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.

BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nWhen Congress does not address the\n\nstandard of proof in a statute, this Court has\n\nlong recognized that the preponderance of the\n\nevidence is a default rule for civil actions.\n\nThe Court has only departed from that default in\n\na tiny number of cases, where the Constitution\n\nrequired it or in cases involving a significant\n\ndeprivation, more dramatic than money damages,\n\nlike deportation, denaturalization, and\n\nexpatriation.\n\nRespondents\u0027 claim seeking monetary\n\nremedies for alleged violations of the FLSA\u0027s\n\novertime requirements is not remotely comparable\n\nto those cases.\n\nRespondents don\u0027t really argue\n\notherwise.  Instead, they offer an assortment of\n\npolicy reasons for favoring employee interests,\n\nbut the policies promoted by the FLSA are\n\nmaterially similar to workplace protections like\n\nthose in Title VII that this Court has\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n20\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nrecognized are adequately protected by the\n\ndefault standard of proof.\n\nThe Court should apply its\n\nlongstanding precedent and hold that the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"17","file_name":"E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.

BATEMAN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\nMS. BATEMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nWhen neither the Constitution nor any\n\nstatute sets a standard of proof to govern a\n\nparticular factual determination, the degree of\n\nproof required for any given claim or defense is\n\na question traditionally left to the judiciary.\n\nHere, application of the clear and\n\nconvincing standard of proof is necessary to\n\ncarry out the explicit public purpose of the\n\nFair Labor Standards Act.\n\nSection 202(b) of the Act declares\n\nthat it is designed to eliminate as rapidly as\n\npracticable labor conditions that fall below a\n\nminimum standard of living.  The preponderance\n\nof the evidence standard falls short of that\n\npurpose because it allocates the risk of factual\n\nerror equally between employers and workers.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBut the FLSA is not your typical civil\n\nstatute where only individual monetary damages\n\nare at stake, and so, as far as the public is\n\nconcerned, the interests of plaintiff and\n\ndefendant are in equipoise.\n\nInstead, it\u0027s a statute that protects\n\nboth the worker\u0027s right to a fair day\u0027s pay for\n\na fair day\u0027s work but also the public\u0027s right to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"30","file_name":"E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.
