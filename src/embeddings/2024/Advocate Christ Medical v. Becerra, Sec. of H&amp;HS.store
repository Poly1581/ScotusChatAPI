SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe same words in the same sentence\n\nshould have the same meaning. Today, we are\n\ntalking about the words \"entitled to benefits\"\n\nin the DSH adjustment.  Just two terms ago, in\n\nEmpire Health, this Court looked at the words\n\n\"entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A\" and\n\nsaid that it means qualifying for the Medicare\n\nPart A program.\n\n\"Entitled to SSI benefits\" in the same\n\nsentence should mean the same thing, qualifying\n\nfor the SSI program. A person qualifies for the\n\nSSI program when she applies and is determined\n\neligible, and that eligibility lasts until it is\n\nterminated.  The government disagrees because it\n\nsays that there\u0027s no such thing as an SSI\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nprogram and the only SSI benefit is a monthly\n\ncash payment.\n\nBut Congress created what it called a\n\nnational program, and it created a program of\n\nincome insurance.  This is a program where a\n\nperson who\u0027s low income enough to qualify in the\n\nfirst place is promised a minimum guaranteed\n\nincome for a calendar year, and in the months\n\nwhere that income is not needed, the cash\n\npayment is suspended.  Nothing is terminated,\n\nand other benefits remain available.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"2","file_name":"Advocate Christ Medical v.

Review\n\nview, make any sense that whether or not a\n\nperson gets a payment is -- has some sort of\n\nrelationship to the DSH fraction?\n\nMS. SHERRY: That\u0027s exactly right.\n\nAnd if you look, actually, at the legislative\n\nhistory for DSH in the Senate report and in the\n\nconference report, where they\u0027re talking about\n\nthe Senate bill, the language is the same there\n\nas it is now when it comes to SSI at least.\n\nAnd for that language, they describe\n\nit as wanting to count those who are enrolled in\n\nthe SSI program, so both acknowledging that\n\nthere is a program and focusing on the class of\n\nenrollees.\n\nAnd I think that is most consistent\n\nwith the DSH purpose, but I think it\u0027s also most\n\nconsistent with the text of DSH, which talks\n\nabout \"entitled to benefits,\" plural, and also\n\nexcludes one particular benefit, which is state\n\nsupplementation.\n\nSo it\u0027s a broad definition, but it\u0027s\n\nalso a nuanced one that would include everything\n\nelse that is not excluded, which includes the\n\ncash benefits but also includes things like\n\nMedicaid continuation and also vocational\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"12","file_name":"Advocate Christ Medical v.

Review\n\nentitlement.\n\nSo \"entitled to benefits\" can mean\n\nexactly the same thing in these two contexts,\n\nbut it -- you know, \"entitle\" -- it\u0027s the nature\n\nof the entitlement.  So, if the entitlement is\n\ndifferent under Medicare and under SSI, then\n\nthat argument falls apart.\n\nMS. SHERRY: So I think there\u0027s two\n\nways to look at the government\u0027s argument.  One\n\nis it\u0027s interpreting \"entitled\" to mean two\n\ndifferent things.  I think, during the Empire\n\nHealth argument, that was a concern.  It was\n\nProblem 1 with the government\u0027s interpretation\n\nthere.\n\nBut I think, even if you don\u0027t read it\n\nthat way and you read it as focusing just on the\n\nqualifications for the program and SSI being\n\ndifferent, it doesn\u0027t hold up on that ground\n\neither.\n\nSo you can take, you know, everything\n\nabout the same word meaning the same thing and\n\nput it to the side and just focus on the SSI\n\nstatute, and it doesn\u0027t look different in any\n\nway that matters to then Medicare Part A.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.

I -- I -- I\u0027m so confused by your\n\nargument, I have to say.  I\u0027m struggling to\n\nunderstand why an individual\u0027s eligibility for\n\npayment in a particular month has any bearing on\n\nthe goals of compensating hospitals for the\n\nhigher cost of low-income people.\n\nSo let me give you a hypothetical.\n\nImagine a man who\u0027s lived well below the poverty\n\nline for his entire life. He has a range of\n\nhealth conditions that result from that kind of\n\nupbringing.  When he turns 65 in January, he\n\napplies for SSI payments and starts receiving\n\nthem in February pursuant to the statute and the\n\nregulations. Let\u0027s say in June he comes into a\n\nbit of cash.  He inherits some jewelry.  He\n\nsells it. He picks up an extra shift at work.\n\nHe gets money back from a friend who owes it to\n\nhim, okay?\n\nWe can all agree that if the extra\n\ncash he gets in June brings him above the\n\nthreshold, he doesn\u0027t get a cash payment that\n\nmonth because now he\u0027s above the threshold.

It did that in 42\n\nU.S.C. 426 and 42 U.S.C. 1395c.
