said we didn\u0027t have\n\nthe funds to pay it at that particular moment.\n\nI\u0027d also like to talk about the\n\n\"subject to appropriations\" language because\n\nthat\u0027s not just a feature

I asked\n\none of my associates to look at how many times\n\nthat appears in the U.S. Code.  When he gave me\n\n200, I told him he could stop.\n\nThis is a recurring provision in the\n\nU.S. Code and they would wipe out 200 references\n\nto subject of appropriations, they would mean\n\nabsolutely nothing.\n\nText matters here.

matters here.\n\nObviously, they\n\ndon\u0027t want to talk about the text of the\n\nappropriations riders because the text doesn\u0027t\n\nhave language that says repeal, it doesn\u0027t limit\n\npayments out to payments in.  It doesn\u0027t even\n\nhave the \"this or any other act\" language that\n\nwas at issue in Will or Dickerson.\n\nAnd to be clear, that\u0027s not because\n\nCongress forgot how to use that phrase.  The\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n64\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nsame 2015 Appropriations Act had multiple\n\nprovisions that failed to appropriate funds and\n\nsaid no funds available under this or any other\n\nact.\n\nThere were also provisions in that\n\nsame 2015 appropriations bill that expressly\n\nrepealed substantive provisions. So Congress\n\nknows how to repeal.  It knows how to\n\nemphatically limit funds. It didn\u0027t do that\n\nhere.\n\nAnother point that I want to make\n\nclear here is just my friend has used the term\n\n\"subsidy\" a lot in describing this program.\n\nThis really doesn\u0027t feel like a subsidy because\n\nnobody -- none of my clients get paid a penny\n\nunless they suffer actual losses.\n\nSo this is not a great subsidy program\n\nif the only way you can get paid a penny is if\n\nyou lose lots of money by losing money by\n\nproviding your products on the exchanges.  So\n\nwhat I would describe this program as is\n\nessentially more like an insurance program.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"59","file_name":"Maine Community Health Options v.
