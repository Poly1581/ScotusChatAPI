Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis Court should reverse the Second\n\nCircuit because it erred in holding that a\n\ndefense never previously litigated to judgment\n\ncan be

Sturgell, the preclusive effect of\n\na judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue\n\npreclusion, which forecloses relitigation of\n\nissues actually litigated and resolved, and\n\nclaim preclusion, which forecloses successive\n\nlitigation of the very same claim.\n\nApplying these long-established\n\nprinciples, the proper rule is a defendant is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfree to argue any previously unresolved defense\n\nit may have to new claims.

And as we said\n\nin our reply brief, there\u0027s three reasons -- I\n\nmean, the key thing is to decide the issue of\n\nlaw, but in terms of the new claim issue, I\n\nthink this Court can easily dispose of that for\n\nthree reasons.\n\nOne, they argued exactly the contrary,\n\narguing that these were new acts, new claims,\n\nnew circumstances in Marcel I, so if there is an\n\nestoppel here, it\u0027s judicial estoppel to them in\n\nchanging their position now, having gotten to\n\ncourt and being here because of that.\n\nAnd then, second, Judge Leval\u0027s\n\ndecision, not binding on this Court, but was\n\nclearly right because it stood for the\n\nunremarkable proposition that subsequent acts\n\ncreate new claims. And that\u0027s also consistent\n\nwith Asetek in patent law, in this Court\u0027s\n\naccrual cases like MGM versus Petrella in the\n\ncopyright context, where each act of\n\ninfringement is a new claim for accrual\n\npurposes.\n\nAnd then, finally, yes, there is the\n\nfactual point that Your Honors have been asking\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"19","file_name":"Lucky Brand Dungarees, Inc. v.
