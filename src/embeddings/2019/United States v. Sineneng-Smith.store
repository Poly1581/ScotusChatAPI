FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, we don\u0027t\n\nthink it is encouragement or inducement knowing\n\nor in reckless disregard of the alien\u0027s unlawful\n\nstatus to either advise them of the existence of\n\nor help someone to apply for a lawful government\n\nprogram.\n\nAnd let me explain why. The -- first\n\nof all, an issue like this came up in United\n\nStates against Williams in which it was -- the\n\nargument was put forth to the court that a\n\nstatute that criminalized \"presenting child\n\npornography\" might in theory be applied to\n\nhanding child pornography over to the police.\n\nAnd the court was skeptical of such a novel and\n\n\"self-defeating interpretation\" of the statute.\n\nI think that reflects a broader\n\nprinciple that a statute like this should not\n\nlightly be interpreted to apply to conduct that\n\nsimply participates in a government program.\n\nThat\u0027s particularly true because this statute is\n\npart of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn\u0027t --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"11","file_name":"United States v.

That\u0027s not relevant either.\n\nWhen this Court decided the Stevens\n\ncase, it pointed to hundreds of hunting websites\n\nand hunting magazines that contained depictions\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nof animal cruelty that fell within the ban.\n\nThat was not a weakness of the challenge. That\n\nwas a strength of the challenge because it\n\nshowed that the speech was not fanciful or\n\nhypothetical but actually was happening.\n\nI point out this statute historically\n\nwas not used very much, but the -- the\n\ngovernment has recently made it a focus of\n\nenforcement. The religious organizations\u0027\n\namicus makes this point on page 30. And it\u0027s\n\nalso something that, as Justice Sotomayor\u0027s\n\nquestion pointed up, they are using as the basis\n\nfor investigation of U.S. citizens for their\n\nprayer, for their speech, and for their legal\n\nadvice.\n\nAnd so, even though in the past there\n\nmay not have been that many uses of this\n\nstatute, one can expect that if this Court\n\nupholds the statute, it will continue to be\n\nthreatened and used. And whether it\u0027s\n\nultimately used does not matter because the\n\nFirst Amendment does not require us to rely on\n\nthe grace of the executive branch.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"45","file_name":"United States v.
