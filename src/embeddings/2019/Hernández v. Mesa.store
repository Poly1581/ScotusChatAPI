VLADECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nWhen this case was first argued to\n\nthis Court two years ago, counsel for Respondent\n\nand counsel for the United States were both\n\nasked whether Petitioners would have a Bivens\n\nremedy if Sergio Hernandez had been standing on\n\nU.S. soil when he was shot and killed by\n\nRespondent. Both said yes.\n\nThe question before this Court today\n\nis, therefore, whether a Bivens action is\n\nnevertheless foreclosed because, in this case,\n\nSergio was standing a few feet to the Mexican\n\nside of the border at the time he was shot.\n\nFor two reasons, we believe that it\n\nisn\u0027t.

think Abbasi is a useful place to\n\nbegin our analysis because, in that case, not\n\nonly did this Court suggest that there were\n\nstill important reasons to retain Bivens in law\n\nenforcement

VLADECK: I take the point,\n\nMr. Chief Justice, and if I may offer two points\n\nin response. The first is I say all of this by\n\nway of putting Bivens in context. That is to\n\nsay that, rather than a bolt from the blue,\n\nBivens was a continuation of this tradition.\n\nBut, to -- to wind the clock forward,\n\nwhich I think is, of course, the -- the task for\n\nthe Court today, I think it\u0027s worth stressing\n\nthat, of the nine cases this Court has decided\n\nsince Carlson, which the government points out\n\nat page 11 of its amicus brief, where this Court\n\nhas had the opportunity to recognize a Bivens\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"8","file_name":"Hernández v.

I understand.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: What\u0027s your argument?\n\nMR.\n\nVLADECK: So our argument is,\n\nfirst, that this Court has long recognized that\n\nclaims against individual law enforcement\n\nofficers for excessive force are what the Fifth\n\nCircuit called classic Bivens claims.\n\nI believe there\u0027s an opinion by then\n\nJudge Kavanaugh referring to it as the core of\n\nBivens to bring a claim that an individual law\n\nHeritage Reporting

But, even if it is a new context,\n\nthe government and Respondent have identified\n\nthree special factors that they argue counsel\n\nhesitation.\n\nFirst, they say it\u0027s because this case\n\nimplicates foreign relations and national\n\nsecurity. As we suggest in our briefs, we don\u0027t\n\nbelieve that follows simply from the fact that\n\nSergio Hernandez was standing on the Mexican\n\nside of the border as opposed to the American\n\nside of the border.\n\nThe government also argues\n\nextraterritoriality as a special factor. As I\n\nthink I hope I explained in response to Justice\n\nKavanaugh\u0027s question, we don\u0027t think\n\nextraterritoriality is implicated here because\n\nthis case touches and concerns U.S. territory","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"18","file_name":"Hernández v.

WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n53\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nA foreign national was killed on\n\nforeign soil by a federal officer patrolling an\n\ninternational border. That is plainly a new\n\ncontext for Bivens purposes, and several special\n\nfactors counsel hesitation here: clear foreign\n\nrelations concerns with Mexico and the need for\n\nborder security, clear extraterritoriality, and\n\nclear signals from Congress in 1983 and the FTCA\n\nthat it does not approve of damages liability\n\nfor injuries abroad.\n\nTaking a step back, Abbasi and other\n\ndecisions have made lower courts markedly less\n\nwilling to imply causes of action for damages.\n\nIf this Court extends Bivens here, on\n\nthese facts, it will threaten to reverse that\n\ntrend by undermining this Court\u0027s consistent\n\nmessage about the importance of caution and\n\njudicial modesty in this area.\n\nTo turn to the first of the three\n\nspecial factors, the foreign relations with\n\nMexico, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s difficult to figure\n\nout exactly why we think Congress might pause,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"48","file_name":"Hernández v.

And I want to be clear,\n\nwe agree that there will be much harder cases,\n\nif, say, for example, Agent Mesa was miles into\n\nMexico, somehow acting under legal authority.\n\nBut RJR Nabisco reinforces, it does\n\nnot distinguish Kiobel in its suggestion that\n\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality --\n\nMr. Chief Justice -- can be displaced when the\n\nunderlying conduct touches and concerns U.S.\n\nterritory with sufficient force to displace the\n\npresumption.\n\nIf ever there was a case, Your Honors,\n\nwhere the underlying conduct touched and\n\nconcerned U.S. territory with sufficient force,\n\nit\u0027s when a U.S. law enforcement officer\n\nstanding on U.S. soil uses lethal force.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel. The case is submitted.\n\n(Whereupon, 12:33 p.m., the case was\n\nsubmitted.)\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n69\n\n1 1 35:6 36:10,20 44:24 49:8,24 66:\n\n5 68:8\n\n25 47:9 57:24,25 58:4,8\n\nAmendment\u0027s [1] 34:1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"62","file_name":"Hernández v.
