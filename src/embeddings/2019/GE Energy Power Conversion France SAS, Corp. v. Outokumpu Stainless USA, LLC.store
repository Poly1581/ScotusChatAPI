DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIf this case involved a domestic\n\narbitration agreement, GE Energy could enforce\n\nit as long as it could satisfy domestic\n\nnon-signatory enforcement doctrines like\n\nequitable estoppel. The question here is\n\nwhether the New York Convention prohibits that\n\nsame result for international arbitration\n\nagreements. It does not.\n\nThe Convention is simply silent about\n\nenforcement by non-signatories.  That silence is\n\nconsistent with the Convention\u0027s design, which\n\nsets a floor, not a ceiling, for enforcing\n\narbitration agreements and awards. The\n\nConvention says that states must do certain\n\nthings to promote arbitration.

ELLIS: Mr. Chief Justice and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThe New York Convention place an\n\nimportant but limited role in the recognition of\n\ninternational arbitration agreements. It\n\nrequires contracting states to recognize and\n\nenforce those agreements in certain\n\ncircumstances, but it does not, as my friend\n\nsays, establish a comprehensive set of rules for\n\narbitration.\n\nFor two fundamental reasons, the\n\nEleventh Circuit has wrong to read into the\n\nwriting requirement of Article II a categorical\n\nprohibition on compelling international\n\narbitration on the basis of estoppel principles.\n\nFirst, the Convention as a whole only ever\n\nrequires contracting states to enforce","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"19","file_name":"GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS, Corp. v.

Or\n\nanother way to get to where you want to go,\n\nanother reading, is that Article II does not\n\nallow contracting states to compel arbitration\n\nwhenever it wants, even without a written\n\nagreement but that they can compel it if someone\n\nis a party, that that\u0027s undefined.\n\nAnd that seems to be how most other\n\ncontracting states have read this, which is that\n\nthere\u0027s a lot of leeway for states to determine\n\nwho\u0027s a party to that written agreement. And\n\nthey can do that through normal principles of\n\nprivity or normal principles of contract\n\ninterpretation, including alter ego and veil\n\npiercing and all the other things that your\n\nadversary accepts can be done.\n\nYou don\u0027t need, as I think the circuit\n\nbelow wrongly required -- it seemed to say you\n\nneed that party\u0027s signature on the agreement.\n\nMR.

That rule is subject to\n\ntwo important corollaries that have already been\n\ndiscussed this morning.\n\nFirst, the Convention does not\n\nprohibit contracting states from enacting other\n\ndomestic laws that can mandate international\n\narbitration on other terms, including oral\n\nagreements or absent consent.

Chapter\n\n2 instead makes the Convention itself\n\ncontrolling in all international arbitration\n\ncases. Chapter 1 applies only where the\n\nConvention does not supply a different rule,\n\nsuch as FAA Section 6 and 7 which govern motions\n\nand witnesses.\n\nThe Convention, however, does provide\n\nits own rule for enforcing arbitration\n\nagreements and, therefore, that rule controls.\n\nThe second corollary also discussed is\n\nthat enforcement by a party under the Convention\n\nincludes its privities, under principles\n\nwell-known to and even discussed by the\n\nConvention drafters.\n\nThose principles differ categorically\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"31","file_name":"GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS, Corp. v.

If I\n\ncould, let me make three points and then suggest\n\npossible ways to resolve this case.\n\nFirst, there\u0027s an international\n\nconsensus in favor of non-signatory enforcement\n\ngenerally. And there are numerous international\n\ncases that allow non-signatory enforcement on\n\nfacts like these.\n\nThe Titan Unity case from Singapore,\n\nthere are cases from France and Switzerland, all\n\nof these are very similar. You have a situation\n\nwhere A contracts with B and C actually performs\n\nthe contract. And in those situations because C\n\nis involved in performing A and B\u0027s contract, C\n\ncan enforce the arbitration agreement if sued by\n\none of the parties to the contract.\n\nSo Singapore, France, Switzerland and\n\nother case -- cases cited in the briefs.\n\nJustice Sotomayor, you were looking","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"59","file_name":"GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS, Corp. v.
