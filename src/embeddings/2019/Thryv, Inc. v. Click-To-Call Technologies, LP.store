Then SAS doesn\u0027t say\n\nthat\u0027s wrong. It\u0027s just nervous about the open\n\nlanguage. And so it tries to take that and --\n\nand narrow it somewhat by focusing really on the\n\nheart of what that was about, which is this\n\nindividualized decision, which we know is\n\nbarred, and now we have a statute.\n\nAnd this statute, well, it\u0027s not\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nexactly just about this decision, is it?
