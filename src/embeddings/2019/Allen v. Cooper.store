CRCA.\n\n18              Article I, Section 8, clause 8, what\n\n19    we\u0027re calling the intellectual property clause,\n\n20    is unique within Article I in laying down an\n\n21    express

Exclusive against all\n\n5    comers, exclusive against the world, including\n\n6    the government and including states.\n\n7              And this exercise of congressional\n\n8    power serves the express constitutional purpose\n\n9    to promote progress.  How?  By affording\n\n10    monetary recompense to copyright holders.

SHAFFER:  James Madison\u0027s\n\n9    conception reflected in the text of what the\n\n10    monopoly would achieve is that the authors and\n\n11    inventors would get paid for their inventions.\n\n12    They would get paid for their creations.\n\n13              And as the Court, as I indicated, back\n\n14    in 1888 recognized, it is antithetical to that\n\n15    to say that government of any kind, certainly\n\n16    the federal government, can infringe those\n\n17    exclusive rights that -- that Congress is to be\n\n18    securing.\n\n19              But, as to Section 5 of the Fourteenth\n\n20    Amendment, Your Honor, this is a case and a\n\n21    legislative record different from what the Court\n\n22    had before it in Florida Prepaid.\n\n23              It is much stronger in relevant part.\n\n24    In part, that\u0027s because of the fundamental\n\n25    difference between copyright law at issue in\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n16\n\n1    this case and patent law that the Court was\n\n2    looking at in Florida Prepaid.\n\n3              In part, it\u0027s also because you have a\n\n4    legislative record that is so much stronger,\n\n5    Your Honors.  You had the Register of\n\n6    Copyrights, Ralph Oman, testifying to Congress,\n\n7    preparing a report based on a 50-state survey,\n\n8    and in -- a -- a very conscientious compilation\n\n9    of comments and studies about what was happening","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"13","file_name":"Allen v.

As this Court has repeatedly\n\n8    reaffirmed, immunity from private lawsuits\n\n9    seeking money damages was inherent in the nature\n\n10    of sovereignty at the founding and remains\n\n11    today.\n\n12              As the -- and the Constitution\n\n13    preserves this aspect of state sovereignty\n\n14    unless there\u0027s compelling evidence that the\n\n15    states surrendered it when they ratified a\n\n16    particular constitutional provision.\n\n17              And my friend has failed to identify\n\n18    any historical evidence that anyone at the\n\n19    founding remotely contemplated that the\n\n20    intellectual property clause would allow for\n\n21    damages lawsuits against states.

suggestion\n\n14    that perhaps Congress could have justified what\n\n15    it did in this act by saying that we predict\n\n16    that a high percentage of copyright\n\n17    infringements are
