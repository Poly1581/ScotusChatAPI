Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe question in this case is whether\n\nmembers of the Financial Oversight Board are\n\nofficers of the United States who must be\n\nselected in the manner that the Appointments\n\nClause prescribes or whether they are instead\n\nterritorial officers who do not have to be\n\nselected in that manner.\n\nThe Constitution\u0027s text,

think you can resolve it based on\n\neffects. I mean, if you think about it, the\n\neffects we\u0027re talking about here are not the\n\nBoard\u0027s actions.
