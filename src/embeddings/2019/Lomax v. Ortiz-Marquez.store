JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear\n\nargument this morning in Case 18-8369, Lomax\n\nversus Ortiz-Marquez.\n\nMr. Burgess.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN T. BURGESS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. BURGESS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nWithout-prejudice dismissals for\n\nfailure to state a claim are not strikes under\n\nSection 1915(g) for three reasons.\n\nFirst, the statute uses a familiar\n\nlegal phrase with a well-established meaning in\n\nthe context relevant here. When courts review\n\njudicial orders to determine their impact on a\n\nfuture action, evaluating preclusion, for\n\nexample, they conclusively presume that the\n\nphrase \"dismissed for failure to state a claim\"\n\nmeans dismissed with prejudice.\n\nIn 1915(g), Congress used the same\n\nphrase in the same basic context. There\u0027s every\n\nreason to think Congress expected courts to\n\napply the phrase\u0027s settled meaning rather than\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nto convert ordinary without-prejudice dismissals\n\ninto sanctions that restrict future suits.\n\nSecond, the structure of the PLRA\n\nfurther supports that interpretation. Read\n\ntogether, the three dismissal categories\n\nidentified in 1915(g) target actions that are\n\nfacially meritless or otherwise abusive.\n\nWithout-prejudice dismissals for\n\nfailure to state a claim are different.

Sure.\n\nI think we have\n\ntwo responses about Rule 15.\n\nOne is the answer\n\nI gave to the Chief Justice earlier, that to the\n\nextent their argument is don\u0027t worry about\n\ndismissals without prejudice because often the\n\njudges are going to have multiple opportunities\n\nto work with the litigant and he -- he will have\n\na full opportunity to make sure he can state his\n\nclaim. It\u0027s not obvious that that is a better\n\nsystem or more consistent with the PLRA to avoid\n\ncourt congestion.\n\nThe other answer is that it\u0027s not\n\nactually clear the extent to which Rule 15\n\noperates in the PLRA context. Most courts of\n\nappeals have held that it does.

BURGESS: It -- it would mitigate\n\nthe unfairness with respect to just pure\n\npleading deficiencies.

I\u0027d like to\n\nmake a few quick points.\n\nFirst, Mr. Olson a number of times in\n\nhis presentation referred to 1915(g) referring\n\nto -- dealing with actions that were dismissed\n\nas non-meritorious on their face. They make the\n\nsame point in their brief.\n\nBut it is very odd to refer to a\n\ndismissal without prejudice that may be based on\n\npurely a procedural defect as suggesting the\n\nclaim is non-meritorious on its face.\n\nAnd I suggest the reason they need to\n\ncharacterize it that way is precisely along the\n\nlines that the Chief Justice alluded to. The\n\nother phrases in 1915(g) are referring to\n\nactions that are clearly abusive, malicious, or\n\nfrivolous.\n\nSo it does not fit with the structure\n\nof the statute to think that actions that are\n\nbeing dismissed without prejudice and that might\n\nbe on a purely procedural ground should receive\n\na sanction under 1915(g).\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n57\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nI\u0027d like -- also like to address the\n\nUnited States\u0027 argument about the literal text","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"51","file_name":"Lomax v.
