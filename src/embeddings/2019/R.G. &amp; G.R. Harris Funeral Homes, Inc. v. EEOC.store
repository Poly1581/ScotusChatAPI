But the Sixth Circuit imposed a new\n\nrestriction, and its holding destroys all\n\nsex-specific policies and even BFOQs while\n\nundermining the protections that Title VII\n\nprovides.\n\nIf you accept at face value Stephens\u0027\n\nconcession that sex means biological males and\n\nfemales, then the funeral home wins. So my\n\nfriend, Mr. Cole, redefines sex to include\n\ntransgender status in two respects.\n\nFirst, my friend\u0027s but-for test would\n\nmean that a women\u0027s overnight shelter must hire\n\na man who identifies as a woman to serve as a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\ncounsellor to women who have been raped,\n\ntrafficked, and abused and also share restroom,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"25","file_name":"R.G. \u0026amp; G.R.

He agrees\n\nthat they\u0027re different traits. And there\u0027s a\n\nreason why when Congress wants to prohibit\n\ndiscrimination based on the traits of sexual\n\norientation and gender identity, it lists them\n\nseparately. It doesn\u0027t define sex as including\n\nthese traits. It\u0027s because Congress has\n\nrecognized there are different traits.
