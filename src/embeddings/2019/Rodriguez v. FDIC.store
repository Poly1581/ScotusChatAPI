REICH\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. REICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThe question presented in this case is\n\nwhat body of law courts should apply to\n\ndetermine ownership of consolidated tax refunds.\n\nIn our view, the answer to that question is\n\nstraightforward.\n\nCourts should apply state law.  That\u0027s\n\nthe body of law that virtually always governs\n\nproperty rights disputes in our federal system,\n\nand, here, the political branches have not\n\ndisplaced that traditional area of state power\n\neither by statute or by federal regulation.\n\nThe FDIC takes a different approach,\n\nalthough exactly what that approach is has\n\nchanged somewhat over the course of this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nlitigation. In the lower courts, the FDIC\n\nadvocated a rule of federal common law known as\n\nthe Bob Richards rule, which holds that\n\nownership of a tax refund presumptively resides\n\nwith the subsidiary whose losses gave rise to\n\nthat refund. That\u0027s the rule the FDIC has\n\nadvocated for decades, and that\u0027s the rule the\n\nTenth Circuit applied below.\n\nBut, in this Court, the government has\n\nabandoned any defense of the Bob Richards rule,\n\nand as our opening brief explains, that rule\n\nfails every test this Court has established for\n\nthe creation of federal common law and\n\ncontravenes the tax laws themselves.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Rodriguez v.

HUSTON: Well, Your Honor, I would\n\n-- I think the Court should make clear that\n\nparties are entitled to rely on the statement\n\nthat their federal regulator has given them\n\nabout how they\u0027re supposed to handle contracts\n\nexactly like this one.\n\nAnd what the federal banking\n\nregulators have instructed is write your\n\ncontract to make clear that you are entering an\n\nagency relationship. And, again, parties who\n\nhave made these contracts have relied on that\n\ninstruction.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"50","file_name":"Rodriguez v.
