made free from any\n\ndiscrimination based on age. Both parties agree\n\nthat that language tracks the text and meaning\n\nof Title VII\u0027s identical federal sector\n\nprovision covering race, sex, and religion.\n\nTogether the two provisions bar\n\ndiscrimination not only in the ultimate outcome\n\nof a personnel decision but also in the process\n\nof making that decision.

I\u0027d like to point out\n\ntwo specific provisions in that, I think, that\n\nare relevant.\n\nThe first one actually isn\u0027t in our\n\nbriefs, so I\u0027m going to take a minute here to\n\ndescribe it because it\u0027s a provision of the CSRA\n\nthat specifically cross-references,\n\nincorporates, and describes Section 633a in the\n\ntext of the statute. And what you\u0027ll see in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n37\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthat provision is that it uses language to\n\ndescribe 633a that is parallel to the language\n\nthat you find in the private sector provisions.\n\nSo I think it underscores that these are just\n\ndifferent ways of seeing the same thing.\n\nAnd I\u0027m referring to 5 U.S.C.\n\n2302(b)(1)(B), and here\u0027s what it says: \"Any\n\nemployee who has authority to take, direct\n\nothers to take, recommend or approve any\n\npersonnel action, shall not, with respect to\n\nsuch authority, discriminate for or against any\n\nemployee or applicant for employment on the\n\nbasis of age, as prohibited under 633a.\"\n\nSo it doesn\u0027t have any of the language","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"33","file_name":"Babb v.

Let me start with the text.\n\nI think it\u0027s very notable that when\n\nthe Solicitor General stood up here, he began in\n\none of the first sentence -- few sentences of\n\nhis presentation by misquoting the text. He\n\nsaid this statute covers \"personnel actions\n\nbased on age.\" He made exactly the mistake that\n\nwe pointed out -- I pointed out in my initial\n\npresentation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"58","file_name":"Babb v.
