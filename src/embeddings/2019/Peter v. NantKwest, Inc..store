Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nAn unsuccessful patent applicant may\n\nseek judicial review through either a direct\n\nappeal to the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C.\n\n141 or a district court suit under Section 145.\n\nSection 145 states that an applicant who files\n\nsuit under that provision must pay all the\n\nexpenses of the proceeding.\n\nThe question presented here is whether\n\nthose expenses include money that the PTO spends\n\nto employ lawyers and paralegals who assist with\n\nthe agency\u0027s defense of the suit.\n\nFor three principal reasons, the\n\nanswer to that question is yes.  First, the term\n\n\"expenses\" unambiguously encompasses costs --\n\nencompasses money paid to employees or other\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\npersonnel to accomplish an -- a particular task.\n\nAnd unlike the term \"costs,\" which has a\n\nsimilarly broad common meaning, this Court has\n\nnot construed the term \"expenses\" as a legal\n\nterm of art with a more limited scope.\n\nSecond, requiring patent applicants\n\nwho file suit under Section 145 to pay personnel\n\nexpenses of the PTO is consistent with the\n\noverall statutory scheme.  Congress has directed\n\nthe PTO to charge fees that are sufficient to\n\ncover its aggregate operating costs, including\n\npersonnel expenses.\n\nAnd the PTO has developed fee\n\nschedules that, in a rough and ready way,\n\nrequire applicants who cause the agency to incur","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Peter v.

As far as I can tell, if you go\n\nback to the 1830s when this was enacted, the\n\npatent litigants paid the costs, including the\n\nattorneys\u0027 fees of the Patent Office, didn\u0027t\n\nthey?\n\nSo you could say, well, this was just,\n\nwhere there are special costs here, this group\n\nshould pay it, not everybody.  That made sense.\n\nBut then in the 1860s, the government\n\ndecides to pay for all these expenses. Now it\n\ndoesn\u0027t make much sense any more to have this\n\ngroup pay.\n\nThen in 1990 it goes back to the first\n\nsystem.

OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. CHU: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThere are three important\n\nconsiderations.  First, the American Rule is a\n\nbedrock principle, and this Court has recognized\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\nand applied that rule for two centuries.\n\nSecond, the government is arguing for\n\na radical departure from the American Rule.  It\n\nis arguing that when a private party sues the\n\ngovernment for its improper action, then that\n\nprivate party must pay for the government\u0027s\n\nattorneys, even if the government and its\n\nattorneys are flatly wrong.\n\nThird, and this responds to some of\n\nthe questions from the justices that were put to\n\nthe government, today there are 3,274 federal\n\nstatutory provisions that use the word\n\n\"expenses\" without any reference to attorneys\u0027\n\nfees or counsel fees.\n\nSome of those provisions are\n\nopen-ended, as is the case here. The government\n\ncan point to not a one of those other provisions\n\nto say that the word \"expenses\" includes\n\nattorneys\u0027 fees, save for the two exceptions,\n\nradical exceptions, it is arguing here.\n\nAnd I would invite questions from the\n\nCourt.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"24","file_name":"Peter v.

First in 1839, what did expenses mean?\n\nThe Bouvier Legal Dictionary define \"expensae\n\nlitis,\" which literally means expenses of\n\nlitigation.  And it actually defined those\n\nexpenses to be the costs that could be awarded\n\nto the prevailing party.\n\nTo the same effect are two other legal\n\ndefinitions from legal dictionaries, both before\n\nand after 1839.  And, in fact, one of those was\n\nthe first Black\u0027s Law Dictionary, which was in\n\n1891.\n\nNow, the second part of the answer is\n\ntoday.
