GANT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nWhile this case is about the FDCPA, it\n\nis also fundamentally about the relationship\n\nbetween this Court and Congress. That\n\nrelationship has long been governed in part by\n\ntwo important presumptions relevant here:\n\nfirst, that Congress legislates against the\n\nbackdrop of the common law and, second, that\n\nCongress legislates aware of this Court\u0027s\n\ndecisions.\n\nWhen Congress enacted the FDCPA in\n\n1977, this Court had long ago adopted a common\n\nlaw rule eventually known as the discovery rule\n\napplicable to cases of fraud and concealment.\n\nCiting to and quoting the Bailey\n\ndecision of this Court from 1875, in Holmberg in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1946, this Court stated that it had long ago\n\nadopted as its own the old chancery rule, that\n\nwhere a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and\n\nremains in ignorance of it without any false or\n\nwant of diligence or care on his part, the bar\n\nof the statute does not begin to run until the\n\nfraud is discovered, though there will be no\n\nspecial circumstance or efforts on the part of\n\nthe party committing the fraud to conceal it\n\nfrom the knowledge of the other party.\n\nThe Court then continued in Holmberg","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Rotkiske v.

And\n\nit\u0027s -- under that view, equitable tolling would\n\nbe best understood as not applicable to this\n\nsituation.\n\nNow this Court, I respectfully submit,\n\nhas sometimes used the label of \"equitable\n\ntolling\" to describe circumstances that I think\n\nare best understood as the Bailey/Holmberg\n\ndiscovery rule, and that has caused confusion\n\nhere and -- and in courts below. And I think it\n\ndid cause confusion in the Third Circuit.\n\nAnd the Third Circuit appeared to\n\noperate under the view, at the time this case\n\nwas decided, that self-concealing conduct did\n\nnot qualify, that there had to be some separate\n\nact, apart from the elements of the offense, in\n\naddition that was concealing.\n\nAn example that I\u0027m familiar with from\n\nmy own practice is in antitrust cases, where\n\nalthough they use the label of fraudulent\n\nconcealment, which I think is best understood\n\nseparately as a close cousin of the discovery\n\nrule, in those circumstances, you have a\n\nviolation alleged of, say, Section 1 of the\n\nSherman Act, a conspiracy.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd most cases, when there\u0027s a statute\n\nof limitations argument that the conduct went\n\nback more than the four years provided in the\n\nstatute, there\u0027s an argument about whether the\n\nconspiracy was concealed.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"8","file_name":"Rotkiske v.

there\u0027s no question that this\n\nCourt, although, when Bailey and Holmberg were\n\ndecided, didn\u0027t use the label discovery rule.\n\nIn more recent cases, like Merck and Gabelli,\n\nhas clearly identified a discovery rule which I\n\nthink under the best reading is separate from\n\nequitable tolling.\n\nThe second point is that there\u0027s an\n\nargument advanced in the briefs and today by\n\nboth counsel for the Respondent of the United\n\nStates that the issue is whether a statute is\n\nall or nothing. Either a -- a common law\n\ndiscovery rule applies to every claim under the\n\nstatute or to none at all.\n\nThat -- that view is unsupported and\n\ncontradicted by Bailey, Exploration, and\n\nHolmberg itself. Bailey was a bankruptcy court\n\n-- a bankruptcy act case. Exploration dealt\n\nwith a statute concerning land patents. And\n\nHolmberg concerned the Federal Farm Loan Act.\n\nThose were not cases -- the\n\nHolmberg/Bailey rule applied to a subset of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\ncases under the statute where the doctrine\n\notherwise applied.
