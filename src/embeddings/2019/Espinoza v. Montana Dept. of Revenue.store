ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. KOMER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. KOMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThis case asks whether the Federal\n\nConstitution allows the wholesale exclusion of\n\nreligious schools from scholarship programs. It\n\ndoes not.\n\nYet, Montana\u0027s Blaine Amendment\n\nrequires that exclusion. As a result, the\n\nBlaine Amendment discriminates against religious\n\nconduct, beliefs, and status in violation of the\n\nfree-exercise clause under Trinity Lutheran.\n\nThe Montana Supreme Court disagreed. That court\n\nheld that barring religious schools from the\n\nprogram did not violate the Federal\n\nConstitution. This Court should reverse that\n\njudgment.\n\nEven Respondents now concede that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nexcluding religious schools from the program is\n\nunconstitutional, but they argue that the court\n\navoided this discrimination by invalidating the\n\nentire program. This is wrong. The only reason\n\nthe court invalidated the program was because it\n\nincluded religious schools.\n\nAnd the court\u0027s remedy did not cure\n\nits discriminatory judgment, nor should the\n\nremedy shield the judgment from review.\n\nPetitioners brought this lawsuit","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Espinoza v.

because of the no-aid clause just in and\n\nof itself is a violation of the free exercise\n\nright of Petitioners.\n\nAnd, you know, the first half of the\n\nargument involved a number of questions about\n\nhow Petitioners are really harmed if the program\n\nas a whole is struck down.\n\nAnd I think I heard two sets of\n\narguments from the other side, from Petitioners,\n\nboth of which I would like to address. One\n\nargument is the sort of broader argument that\n\njust, the no-aid clause is just constitutionally\n\ndefective, like, by its very nature, because it\n\nis discriminatory, is not capable of being\n\napplied, and, therefore, the court should just\n\nremand and tell the court you just can\u0027t apply\n\nthis illegal rule.\n\nAnd the second argument I heard is\n\nthis somewhat narrower argument that as applied,\n\nthe problem here is that the court excluded\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nreligious schools from a general program as in\n\nTrinity Lutheran.\n\nSo if I could just address those --\n\nthose two theories of the case by Petitioners.\n\nSo I think the first argument really is\n\ntantamount to an argument that the no-aid clause\n\nis facially unconstitutional, because like every\n\nsingle time you applied the no-aid clause, the\n\nrule it recites is that religious schools don\u0027t\n\nget money because --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"31","file_name":"Espinoza v.
