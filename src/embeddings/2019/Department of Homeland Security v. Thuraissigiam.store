Such aliens are clearly inadmissible\n\nand have no right to be in this country.\n\nCongress reasonably concluded that a\n\nfull-blown removal hearing was not necessary to\n\nmake that determination.  Congress was also\n\nconcerned, however, for -- about the possibility\n\nfor delay and abuse of the asylum system if\n\nevery time such a clearly inadmissible alien\n\nsought asylum.

GELERNT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe statute here eliminates any\n\nmeaningful role for the courts, even to ensure\n\nthat the statutes and regulations were followed.\n\nDuring the 60-year finality period, Congress\n\nalso tried to exclude the courts, leaving only\n\nthat review that was \"required\" by the\n\nConstitution.\n\nThis Court, nonetheless, continued to\n\nreview legal claims in habeas.  It did so while\n\nexpressly rejecting the government\u0027s argument\n\nthat deportation was not the type of restraint","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"24","file_name":"Department of Homeland Security v.
