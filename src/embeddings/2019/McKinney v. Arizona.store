The path in question 1 argues that the\n\nArizona Supreme Court reopened McKinney\u0027s\n\nsentencing proceeding.  The Ninth Circuit had\n\nearlier granted a conditional writ of habeas\n\ncorpus and gave the State the option of either\n\nimposing a life sentence or seeking the death\n\npenalty again.\n\nThe State chose the latter, which\n\nrequired brand new state action in the form of\n\nnew sentencing.

But McKinney is not seeking to use\n\nRing retroactively as a sword to challenge his\n\nearlier proceedings.  Rather, he\u0027s saying that\n\nwhen the State conducts a new proceeding, that\n\nsentencing must comply with current law.\n\nOtherwise, the implications would be\n\nfrightening.  For example, a state could run a\n\nre-sentencing today in 2019 with a pre-Batson\n\njury, with race-based jury strikes.

Decisions like\n\nCaldwell say that that\u0027s a decision for the\n\nsentencer at the trial court where they can see\n\nthe defendant, confront the witnesses. And in\n\ncases like Arizona, there\u0027s a double circuit\n\nbreaker function served by the scheme because\n\nthey have to win both no death sentence -- they\n\nhave to win a death sentence both at the trial\n\ncourt and at the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nAnd what they\u0027re seeking to do here is\n\nfuse that into one thing.  Just as long as it\n\ncan be fixed on appeal, that\u0027s enough.

KATYAL: Justice Kavanaugh, I\n\nthink in many of the Eddings cases you\u0027ve done\n\nexactly that.  In cases in which there\u0027s a doubt\n\nas to whether or not the jury consider -- or the\n\ntrial court considered mitigating evidence,\n\nyou\u0027ve sent it back to the trial court for a\n\nresentencing and, indeed, for a jury\n\ndetermination.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"16","file_name":"McKinney v.

Effectively,\n\nQP 1 resolves the resolution of this case no\n\nmatter which way it goes. If there\u0027s\n\nretroactive application of Ring and Hurst and\n\nall current law applies, Arizona does not\n\ncontend that we have Ring-compliant aggravators\n\nhere, and this would be a case that we would\n\ntake back to the trial court.\n\nTo the extent that there is no\n\nretroactive application, Clemons is the\n\ngoverning law, and what Arizona did fits\n\nentirely within Clemons.  All of the cases\n\ninvolving trial court remands under Eddings from\n\nthis Court the Petitioner has cited predate\n\nClemons.  Caldwell predates Clemons.

The first one I would point\n\nout is to the extent that the Ninth Circuit\n\nbelieved that a new direct proceeding had to be\n\nengaged in, and the state instead engaged in a\n\nmore narrow -- which I will get to -- and\n\ncollateral proceeding, the answer wouldn\u0027t be\n\nthat that proceeding has now become direct for\n\npurposes of retroactivity.\n\nThe answer would be, just as occurred\n\nin the Styers case, for Petitioner to return to\n\nthe habeas court and say the conditional habeas\n\nwrit was not complied with.  You asked them to\n\ndo X, and they only did Y, which is inadequate.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t change the nature of the proceeding\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"36","file_name":"McKinney v.
