the question in this case boils\n\ndown to whether the government has put forward a\n\nsufficient case for holding that the words\n\n\"inadmissible\" and \"removable\" in the stop-time\n\nrule mean

it\u0027s\n\nimportant to recognize that the stop-time rule\n\nis applied only in the context of removal\n\nproceedings after the immigration judge has just\n\ndecided whether an alien is inadmissible or\n\nremovable.  So there\u0027s like two steps.\n\nAt step one, the immigration judge\n\ndecides whether an offense renders the alien\n\ninadmissible or removable.

And we\n\nwalk through in our brief that the arguments\n\ngiven in this Jurado case are clearly wrong.  So\n\nthis Court\u0027s cases hold that even if a statute\u0027s\n\nambiguous, you don\u0027t defer to an agency decision\n\nthat\u0027s clearly wrong, which I think is true for\n\nthis Jurado case.
