15 million Americans became victims of\n\nidentity theft. One-third of those had their\n\npersonal information misused in an employment or\n\ntax-related fraud setting.\n\nMany of those victims were left to\n\nuntangle reputations, eligibilities, and other\n\nfinances. That is why Kansas, like every other\n\nstate, makes identity theft a crime.

The conflict fatal to the\n\nArizona employment statute is not present here,\n\nbecause Kansas prohibits the theft of personal\n\ninformation by anybody, not work by unauthorized\n\naliens.

There is the exact same sort of\n\ncomprehensive and systematic system of\n\nimmigration, civil and criminal penalties.\n\nAnd only the federal government can\n\nexercise many of the forms of discretion that\n\nare baked into those enforcement mechanisms. So\n\njust to offer one example, it is a deportable\n\noffense to use false information in order to\n\nhave fraud on the federal employment\n\nverification system.\n\nHowever, there\u0027s a discretionary\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n56\n\nOfficial\n\nexception to that.  If an individual enters the\n\nUnited States as a lawful permanent resident and\n\nthen is working solely to support his or her own\n\nimmediate family, the federal immigration\n\nauthorities can waive deportation in those\n\ncircumstances.\n\nOnly the federal government can\n\nbalance that policy as an immigration matter.\n\nWhen the states prosecute, the only remedy is\n\nthe state criminal offense and not the graduated","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"49","file_name":"Kansas v.
