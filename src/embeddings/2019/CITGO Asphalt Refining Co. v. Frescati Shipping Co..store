It is not a\n\nprevailing characteristic of the port.  It\u0027s\n\nsomething from outside the port that comes in\n\nand causes an abnormal event.\n\nAnd it\u0027s not the accident itself that\n\nhas to be abnormal.

GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nI thought I would come at this from\n\nthe perspective that Justice Alito asked about.\n\nWhat if we regard the text as in equipoise?  It\n\nsays safe, and that could mean different things\n\nin different contexts. And I\u0027d ask the Court to\n\njust look at what the position of the parties\n\nwas at the time they entered into this\n\nagreement.\n\nSo, at the time that they did this, it\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\nwasn\u0027t just you had to interpret safe port.\n\nThere were two different kinds of forms, and\n\nthey were basically evenly divided.  This was\n\nall done by an industry that they just choose\n\nforms off the shelf, and there are a bunch that\n\nsay safe port and there are a bunch that say the\n\ncharterer will exercise due diligence in\n\nselecting a safe port. And so that\u0027s a pretty\n\nmeaningful choice.\n\nThen you say, okay, with respect to\n\nthe ones that say safe port, what was the\n\nunderstanding of the industry at the time?  Now\n\nevery one of those forms said that any dispute\n\nwill be resolved by arbitration in either New\n\nYork or London.  There were none for Houston.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"44","file_name":"CITGO Asphalt Refining Co. v.
