DREEBEN: So, presumably, not\n\nbecause the statute actually says that the\n\ngovernment can get a warrant requiring\n\ndisclosure. The act that -- that occurs in the\n\ncase is an act on the provider. And the\n\nfundamental distinction between a search and a\n\nsubpoena-type instrument is that in a search\n\nthe government does go right in and grab the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\ninformation.\n\nIn a subpoena context, the instrument\n\noperates on a person and it places an\n\nobligation on that person to make disclosure.\n\nOnce it gets to the government, once the\n\ngovernment has the account in hand, it executes\n\nthe warrant aspect of the order, which is a\n\nprobable-cause-based order, allowing the\n\ngovernment to search the account.\n\nSo it\u0027s essentially analogous to if\n\nthe government knew that an individual had a\n\nlaptop computer and it wanted to obtain that\n\ncomputer and search it, it could serve a\n\nsubpoena on the individual, requiring the\n\nproduction of the laptop.\n\nOnce the government gets the laptop\n\ninto its custody, it needs a search warrant to\n\nget in and look at the information. And here a\n\nsingle order achieves both functions under a\n\nstatute whose structure and language makes\n\nclear that it places disclosure obligations on\n\na provider and it then authorizes the\n\ngovernment to conduct the search.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Dreeben -­","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"3","file_name":"United States v.

If Congress takes a look at this,\n\nrealizing that much time and -- and innovation\n\nhas occurred since 1986, it can write a statute\n\nthat takes account of various interests.

Well, I think this\n\nCourt\u0027s case law provides a test that says that\n\nif the activity that\u0027s within the focus of the\n\nstatute occurs in the United States, the fact\n\nthat there may be antecedent or other conduct\n\nabroad doesn\u0027t detract from a domestic\n\napplication.\n\nAnd I have an example that I think\n\nwill help illustrate that point. Suppose that\n\na defendant in federal court were convicted and\n\nordered to pay a fine and the defendant said, I\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11\n\nOfficial\n\ncan\u0027t do that with my domestic assets. They\u0027re\n\nall located abroad.\n\nI am fairly confident that the courts\n\nwould say the obligation falls on you. How you\n\nraise the money is your concern. It\u0027s not an\n\nextraterritorial application of the statute to\n\nsay bring the money home and pay the fine.\n\nAnd that\u0027s the same that we\u0027re asking\n\nto happen with the warrant. In fact, the text\n\nof the statute says nothing about\n\nextraterritorial conduct.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Dreeben, I\n\ndon\u0027t know that you fairly answered Justice\n\nGinsburg\u0027s question.\n\nThis is a 1986 statute.

I\n\nmean, there\u0027s an American citizen who\u0027s being\n\ninvestigated for crimes committed in the United\n\nStates. The government shows probable cause\n\nthat there is evidence of this crime in e-mails\n\nthat are in the possession of an American\n\nInternet service provider. And there they have\n\nan urgent need for the information.\n\nBut the provider has chosen to store\n\nthe data overseas and, in fact, in some\n\ninstances, has actually broken it up into\n\nshards so that it\u0027s stored not just in one\n\nforeign country but in a number of foreign\n\ncountries.\n\nNow what -- what happens in that\n\nsituation? There is no way in which the\n\ninformation can be obtained except by pursuing\n\nMLATs against multiple countries, a process\n\nthat could -- that will take many months, maybe\n\nyears?

DREEBEN: I have four quick\n\npoints, two technical and two substantive.\n\nThe technical point first is, Justice\n\nBreyer, you asked what the authority of the\n\ndistrict court is. The authority of the\n\ndistrict court, in this case for a magistrate\n\njudge, comes from, first, 2703, which entitles\n\na court of competent jurisdiction to issue the\n\nrelevant warrant in this case.\n\nThis is on page 6A of the government\u0027s\n\nappendix to its brief. There is then a\n\ndefinition of a court of competent jurisdiction\n\non page 12A of the appendix to the government\u0027s\n\nbrief, which defines it to include any\n\nmagistrate judge that has jurisdiction over the\n\noffense being investigated, as well as several\n\nother bases.\n\nThis was a Patriot Act amendment\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n63\n\nOfficial\n\ndesigned to expand the authority of courts to\n\nissue orders.\n\nThe second technical question is the\n\none asked by Justice Kennedy on whether\n\nMicrosoft could voluntarily disclose this\n\ninformation to the government.
