The distinction in\n\nHartman, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg,\n\ncomes and rests entirely on the fact that there\n\nwas absolute prosecutorial immunity for the\n\nactor who actually imposed the injury there.\n\nAnd I see three major distinctions between\n\nHartman and what\u0027s going on in this case.\n\nThe first of those is that, in\n\nHartman, there was absolute prosecutorial\n\nimmunity. And what that meant is you could not\n\nsue the prosecutor; you had to sue somebody\n\nupstream. But the reason why there\u0027s absolute\n\nprosecutorial immunity, as this Court explained\n\nin the decisions it cited in Hartman, in Reno,\n\nand in Wayte, is because the Court wants to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\navoid inquiry into prosecutorial\n\ndecision-making, and that\u0027s so because\n\nprosecutors are both independent and\n\ndeliberative.\n\nAbsolutely none of those factors is\n\npresent in this case. You needn\u0027t look at\n\nanything a prosecutor has done. The decisions\n\nhere were not made by independent actors. They\n\nwere made by a police officer and by a city\n\ncouncil member whose level of animus on the\n\nrecord shows that this was not an arrest about\n\nanything that occurred in the court -- in the\n\ncouncil chamber that day, and there was no -­\n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So your -- your -­\n\nyour beginning -- I -- I couldn\u0027t quite -­","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"3","file_name":"Lozman v.

It just does not\n\nlook like the typical cases for which you\n\ndesigned the constitutional tort rule. And\n\nthat\u0027s what Hartman tells us.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -­\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Wall, we allow\n\npeople to sue under 1983 for discriminatory\n\narrests under the equal protection clause and\n\nwithout showing anything about whether probable\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n53\n\nOfficial\n\ncause exists or not.\n\nWhat has been the experience with\n\nrespect to those cases? And why is this\n\narea -- why should the rule be any different\n\nthan that one?\n\nMR. WALL: So I think what we\u0027d say is\n\ndifferent for a couple of reasons but one\n\nsimilarity, and this was one of the legal\n\npoints I wanted to make.\n\nThose cases are about race. Race, the\n\nCourt has said, is so rarely a proper\n\nconsideration for officers that the Court does\n\ntreat them differently.\n\nSpeech is the kind of thing that\n\nofficers often can and must in these situations\n\ntake account of. And even there, even though\n\nit\u0027s more subjective than in virtually every\n\nother context, even there you\u0027ve got the\n\nobjective screen of Armstrong. So you\u0027ve still\n\ngot to prove that similarly situated people\n\nwere treated differently.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"47","file_name":"Lozman v.

WALL: So I -- Justice Gorsuch, I\n\nthink a before-trial rule would be perfectly\n\nfine, again, as long -- because I think it\n\nreflects the realities of policing, which is\n\nthat police aren\u0027t lawyers. They arrest based\n\non conduct.\n\nAnd all the same reasons the Court\n\napplied the Devenpeck rule are exactly why the\n\ncommon law, I think on the best reading, had\n\nthe Devenpeck rule too. And it wasn\u0027t like the\n\ncommon law didn\u0027t know about speech. The\n\nrestatement recognized it. You may be pulled\n\nover for speeding, even though that you think\n\nit\u0027s because you\u0027ve complained about the\n\ndepartment.\n\nThe common law took all of these\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial\n\nthings into account too.

KARLAN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS. KARLAN: Thank you. I\u0027d just like\n\nto begin with the common law and ask this Court\n\nto read its own decision in Dinsman, which is\n\nthe only decision by this Court talking about\n\nprobable cause and false arrest that antedates\n\nthe passage of Section 1983.\n\nAnd here\u0027s what the Court says on page\n\n402: \"Probable cause or not is of no further\n\nimportance than as evidence to be weighed by\n\nthe jury in connection with all the other\n\nevidence.\" That\u0027s the rule we\u0027re asking for.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n63\n\nOfficial\n\nWe\u0027re asking for the common law rule here.\n\nAnd if you look at Prosser on Torts,\n\nhe says, people keep getting mistaken between\n\nmalicious prosecution, which has always had a\n\nno probable cause requirement, and false\n\nimprisonment, of which false arrest is a\n\nsubset, which has never had that requirement at\n\ncommon law as part of the Plaintiff\u0027s\n\ncase-in-chief.\n\nThe second point I\u0027d like to make is a\n\npoint that goes back to the Devenpeck issue,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"56","file_name":"Lozman v.
