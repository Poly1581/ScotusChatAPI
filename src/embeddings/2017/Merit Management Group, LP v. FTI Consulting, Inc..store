Because I\n\nthink one point my -- my friend and I agree on\n\nis that when Congress was passing the\n\npredecessor to 546(e) back in the day, there\n\nwas already substantial protection for the\n\nintermediaries under the recovery provision,\n\n550, if they were truly conduits and weren\u0027t\n\nthe beneficial owners.\n\nAnd so I think what Congress was\n\ntrying to do with 546(e) was to provide an\n\nalternative, more bright-line way for the\n\nfinancial intermediaries to get out of the case\n\nearly at the motion to dismiss stage.\n\nAnd the problem with this looking for\n\nthe beneficial ownership is it\u0027s really the\n\nsame inquiry, and it could be fact-specific in\n\na particular case, that Congress was trying to\n\nsupplement with this bright-line rule.\n\nAnd we think our rule gives a nice\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"40","file_name":"Merit Management Group, LP v.
