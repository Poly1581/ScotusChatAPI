Rather, they\u0027re entitled to\n\none of a range of lawful sentences.\n\nAnd the sentencing commission has\n\nestablished a framework in which there is, for\n\nany given defendant with a given criminal\n\nhistory and a given offense conduct, there is\n\nactually a range of reasonable sentences within\n\nthat lawful one.\n\nAnd so, when you\u0027re talking about an\n\nerror that may have created reasonable\n\nprobability of moving within that range, but\n\nthe sentence that was imposed still falls\n\nwithin the right range.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. But if you\n\nwill read, as I hope you would someday, the\n\nintroduction to the initial version of the\n\nguidelines, which happens still to be there,\n\nyou will see that the purpose of the Commission\n\nis first to create a set of guidelines and\n\nthen, through the procedures I\u0027m talking about,\n\nto see what judges actually do in administering\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n38\n\nOfficial\n\nthe guidelines so that those can be improved\n\nand changed over time.\n\nNow, if we are looking at not what the\n\njudge did under the guideline but what the\n\njudge thinks he did under the guideline, but he\n\ngot the guideline all wrong, then, all right,\n\nwe can\u0027t do it, we can\u0027t carry that out.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"32","file_name":"Rosales-Mireles v.
