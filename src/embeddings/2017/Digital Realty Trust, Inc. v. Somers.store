argument on the other\n\nside as to why our interpretation is somehow\n\nabsurd or as to why this is one of those\n\nexceptional circumstances where the Court\n\nshould not pay heed to the unambiguous language\n\nis that there are relatively few cases that\n\nwould be covered by the third clause.\n\nBut I don\u0027t think that there\u0027s really\n\nany basis for that conclusion here. As the\n\ngovernment recognizes in its brief, around\n\n80 percent of individuals who report to the SEC\n\nalso report internally. And so contrary to the\n\nreasoning of really the leading case on the\n\nother side, the Second Circuit\u0027s decision in\n\nBerman, we know that there certainly is a\n\ncategory of employees who report in both ways.\n\nSo then the question becomes whether,\n\nin fact, there are very few cases in which an\n\nindividual is able to get to the step of\n\nreporting to the SEC. The argument on the\n\nother side is that when an employee reports\n\ninternally, retaliation will come so quickly\n\nthat they will not be able also to report to\n\nthe SEC.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So can you please\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n8\n\nOfficial\n\ntell me, under your reading, what we make of","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"5","file_name":"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v.

Kagan\u0027s\n\npoint, it is -- actually, it is exactly true\n\nthat Petitioner\u0027s reading does create a serious\n\nanomaly. If anyone reports to the SEC at any\n\ntime, it could be half a decade or a decade\n\nearlier, on a completely unrelated issue,\n\nthey\u0027re a whistleblower for life.

And then the second they walk out\n\nof that meeting they report to the SEC. They\n\neven use the right fax number and they use the\n\nright form.

And the\n\nCourt said if you apply the statutory\n\ndefinition to that preexisting injury and\n\nrequire that injury to be on the job, that\n\nwould be anomalous, because it would unfairly\n\nassign liability to the employer, and it would\n\ndeter the statutory purpose of keeping\n\nemployers from retaliating against disabled\n\nemployees.\n\nSo I think that decision is analogous\n\nhere.

thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nThe first, with regard to these cases\n\nconcerning statutory definitions, I think if\n\nyou look at the cases cited by Respondent and\n\nthe government, most of those

And to be sure,\n\nmany of those cases are pre-1986 cases.\n\nThey do not use the term \"absurdity,\"\n\nbut they sound in absurdity. And the perfect\n\nexample of that is Mr. Michel\u0027s favorite case,\n\nLawson versus Suwannee Fruit. That was a case\n\nin which if the statutory definition of\n\ndisability were given effect, an employer would\n\nbe liable for the entirety of an employee\u0027s\n\ndisability, even if the previous partial\n\ndisability occurred when the employee was not\n\non the job.\n\nAnd the Court said that that would\n\nlead to obvious incongruities in the language\n\nand destroy the very purpose of the statute.\n\nSo, again, that\u0027s absurdity by any other name.\n\nAnd to the extent that Respondent and\n\nthe government seem to suggest that absurdity","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"54","file_name":"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v.
