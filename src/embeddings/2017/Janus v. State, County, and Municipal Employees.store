MESSENGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nAbood should be overruled because it\n\nfailed to apply heightened First Amendment\n\nscrutiny to a compulsory fee for speech to\n\ninfluence governmental policies. Abood\u0027s\n\nfailure places it at odds with Harris, with\n\nKnox, and a slew of other speech and\n\nassociation precedents.\n\nNow Respondents attempt to justify\n\nAbood\u0027s results with rationales found nowhere\n\nin that decision, which undercuts any stare\n\ndecisis value in retaining Abood.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask,\n\nMr. Messenger, if you are right about agency\n\nfees, what about three things: One is student\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"2","file_name":"Janus v.

What about the private sector,\n\nagency fees compelled by state law in the\n\nprivate sector?\n\nMR. MESSENGER: Yes, Your Honor. With\n\nrespect to the first two instances, the student\n\nassociation or student fees and the bar\n\nassociation fees, those cases are\n\ndistinguishable for reasons stated in Harris.\n\nThey\u0027re justified by different interests.\n\nThe state bar associations are\n\njustified by the state\u0027s compelling government\n\ninterest in regulating the practice of law\n\nbefore its courts. The student association\n\nfees are justified by the government\u0027s or what\n\n-- a university\u0027s compelling interest in\n\nsetting up a viewpoint-neutral forum for\n\nspeech.\n\nAnd then, with respect to the private\n\nsector cases, they hinge on a question of state\n\naction. So, in this case, only public sector\n\nunion fees are being challenged.

And when the Court\n\nunanimously upheld the idea of agency fees, it\n\nconsidered whether or not these issues would\n\nconstrain the constitutional prerogatives of\n\ngovernment to act under democratic impulses to\n\ncome up with a system that would fit the local\n\nculture, history, private sector background of\n\nwhat state governments were having to do to\n\nrecruit and attract the most willing and able\n\npeople to discharge the public services that\n\npublic employees are required to perform.\n\nSo, when this Court addressed in\n\nLehnert the question of how do you draw the\n\nline between those fees that are deemed to be\n\nideological and those that are deemed to be\n\npart of a statutorily mandated process, the\n\nCourt cleaved, and the question of whether or\n\nnot the statute mandated, as it does here,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n53\n\nOfficial\n\nexclusive representation and the union is\n\nrequired to represent the minority members,\n\nwhat Justice Scalia said was it is fair to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"44","file_name":"Janus v.
