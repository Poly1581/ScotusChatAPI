Now\n\nhow does a court justify allowing somebody to\n\nfile a claim after the statute of limitations\n\nhas run?\n\nAnd the theory, they say, is that\n\nthere was this old doctrine of equitable\n\ntolling, and when Congress enacted the statute\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nof limitations, it did so with the\n\nunderstanding that it would be subject to the\n\ndoctrine of equitable tolling.\n\nSo, in order to allow the -- the case\n\n-- the claim to be filed after the statute of\n\nlimitations has run, it has to fit within the\n\ndoctrine of equitable tolling. And equitable\n\ntolling requires diligence and extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"27","file_name":"China Agritech, Inc. v.

Tolling is made up by courts.\n\nCourts decide if there is tolling, how long the\n\ntolling will be.\n\nThey\u0027re not -- tolling questions are\n\nnot resolved by the federal rules. Equitable\n\ntolling is court-made law, not rule-made law.\n\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, it\n\nis correct that Shady Grove did not address\n\ntolling. We distilled the principle from Shady\n\nGrove, however, that if a plaintiff has a\n\ntimely claim, which we assert has been conceded\n\nhere for individual claims, then the Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure apply automatically and all of\n\nthe rules apply.\n\nHe\u0027s acknowledged, I think today, that\n\nRule 20 and Rule 24 apply, so that intervention\n\nand joinder can occur, and the question is,\n\nwhat is the principle of equity that says Rule\n\n23 doesn\u0027t apply?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"32","file_name":"China Agritech, Inc. v.

Professor Benjamin\n\nKaplan, who was the reporter, had a very long\n\narticle, which this Court has cited, I think,\n\nnine times, in the Harvard Law Review in 1967.\n\nAnd what he explained was that the\n\nreason for this change, in part, was to address\n\nthe situation of the small claim of the small\n\nperson. Those were his words, not mine.\n\nBut the idea behind bringing a\n\nrepresentative action was the idea that if you\n\nhad what would be a small value claim, you had\n\nthe ability to aggregate those claims by the\n\nfiling of your class action.
