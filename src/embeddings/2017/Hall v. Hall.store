There\u0027s only\n\nthree cases we have been able to find in the\n\nSixth Circuit, two of which are unreported,\n\nthat disagree with what every other circuit\n\nthat we have been able to find that\u0027s ruled on\n\nthis has found.\n\nSo I think all we\u0027re saying to you is\n\nleave the rules where they are. To the extent\n\nyou\u0027re concerned about any, you know, problems\n\nwith the rules, any problems with\n\nconsolidation, I think the national rules\n\ncommittee is the place to be.\n\nIf there are no further questions.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nMr. Simpson, four minutes.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"57","file_name":"Hall v.

I think it\u0027s\n\nimportant to understand that all the circuits\n\ndisagree about even what is consolidation for\n\nall purposes.\n\nThe Bogosian case from the Third\n\nCircuit says a case consolidated for pretrial\n\nand trial purposes is for all purposes.\n\nThat\u0027s what happened in our case. It\n\nwas consolidated for pretrial and trial. And\n\nso, under the Third Circuit definition, it is\n\nall purposes.\n\nOther circuits have a completely\n\ndifferent definition and they talk about, in\n\nthe unitary consolidation type of case, there\u0027s\n\none docket, there\u0027s one judgment entered, not\n\ntwo. They call that all-purpose consolidation.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n65\n\nOfficial\n\nSo that\u0027s one of the problems we have\n\nhere.
