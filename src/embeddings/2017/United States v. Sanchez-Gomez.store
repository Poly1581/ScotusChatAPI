CAHN: In the Central District of\n\nCalifornia, there was a policy of using leg\n\nshackles only in the initial appearances only,\n\nand that was the Howard case, which was the\n\nbegin -- the first litigation ever concerning\n\nshackling that established the right to\n\ncollateral-order jurisdiction in the circuit on\n\n-- over these matters.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: If -- if there is no\n\nrule, there\u0027s no blanket rule, but an\n\nindividual district judge orders that a\n\ndetainee be shackled, do you think that could\n\nbe contested via the collateral-order doctrine?\n\nMR. CAHN: Well, I think the only\n\nthing before this Court is a complete denial of\n\nan individual determination on the basis of\n\nviolence or risk of escape. And so that is\n\nclearly a due process violation and subject to\n\nthe collateral-order doctrine.\n\nThe Court did say in Stack that\n\nthere\u0027s a distinction between the discretionary\n\ncalls that a judge makes in setting the amount\n\nof bond versus the refusal to reduce an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\nexcessive bond.
