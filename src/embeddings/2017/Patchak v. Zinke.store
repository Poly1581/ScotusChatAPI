Part\n\nof what\u0027s offensive here to the\n\nseparation-of-powers principles is that\n\nCongress is directing the outcome in a case.\n\nIt could be a set of cases.\n\nAnd I submit, by the way, look -­\n\nlooking to Bank Markazi, if there had been\n\n1,000 cases just like Patchak\u0027s, I think the\n\noutcome would be the same. So the fact that it\n\nwas one case is, I think, probative of\n\nassessing whether or not the Congress is\n\nactually deciding a case, rather than actually\n\nmaking the law to be applied by the courts.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"8","file_name":"Patchak v.

And the\n\nmajority disagreed and said this had to do with\n\nAPA waiver of immunity.\n\nI look at statutory history and this\n\nnew act, the Reaffirmation Act, was in the\n\ncontext of that dispute in that case. And what\n\nCongress did was settle the question, which I\n\nbelieve it\u0027s entitled to do and is not\n\nunconstitutional, it ratified the acts of the\n\nSecretary\u0027s taking of this land, and by that\n\nact, implicated the Quiet Title Act.\n\nAnd so, if it did that, I see this -­\n\nand I don\u0027t understand why it\u0027s not, that\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity that the Court did\n\nnot recognize in Patchak I.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"15","file_name":"Patchak v.

I think that\u0027s a quintessential\n\nseparation-of-powers question and a very, very\n\nserious one.\n\nBut I think there is something\n\nfundamentally different about suits involving\n\nthe government because sovereign immunity -- or\n\nany suit against the government is a matter\n\nonly of largesse and -- and the government\u0027s\n\nvoluntary choice.\n\nWe have repeatedly through the\n\ncenturies said the government can at any moment\n\ntake away its sovereign immunity. It can take\n\naway that niceness of giving you the immunity.\n\nSo I see the potential of less of a\n\nproblem with separation of powers if -- if the\n\ngovernment has withdrawn sovereign immunity\n\nthan it directing the outcome between private\n\nparties.

O\u0027CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, I\n\nthink this Court\u0027s decision in Block versus\n\nNorth Dakota goes a long way to answering that\n\nquestion. In Block, the state was suing -­\n\nbringing an officer suit because it was outside\n\nof the statute of limitations in the Quiet\n\nTitle Act. What the Court said was you can\u0027t\n\njust use an officer suit to get around the\n\nQuiet Title Act; now that we have Congress\u0027s\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity in the Quiet Title\n\nAct, you have to comply with those statutory\n\nprovisions. The same should be true of the\n\nAPA.\n\nSo if -- if Petitioner could -- could\n\njust bring an officer suit against Secretary\n\nZinke for prospective injunctive relief, that\n\nwould vitiate the final agency action\n\nrequirement of the APA, the statute of\n\nlimitations of the APA. Congress has given us\n\nits waiver of sovereign immunity in the APA,\n\nand when it enacts a statute like this, it has\n\nrevoked it.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It -­\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me\n\nwhat other actions in your judgment, besides\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\nthis one, could be or would be filed relating","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"42","file_name":"Patchak v.
