Congress targeted a specific\n\ndomestic act, the supply of components from the\n\nUnited States, with a particular intent, that\n\nthe components be combined abroad in a way\n\nthat, if it happened in the United States,\n\nwould constitute infringement.\n\nCongress provided a cause of action\n\nfor the domestic infringement and provided a\n\ndamages remedy that guaranteed the victim of\n\nthe infringement damages adequate to compensate\n\nfor the infringement.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nThe plain text of the Patent Act,\n\ntherefore, gives the victim of Section 271(f)\n\ninfringement an entitlement to adequate\n\ndamages, including lost profits.

Yeah, we absolutely do.\n\nWe\u0027re asking the rule -- affirmatively to adopt\n\nthis rule as a matter of Section 284, the\n\ngeneral damages provision that applies all\n\nthroughout the Patent Act. It applies\n\nbasically everywhere in American law and should\n\napply basically everywhere in the Patent Act as\n\nwell, and not just in the rare cases that come\n\nup under 271(f).\n\nI think one piece of that is that\n\nreally the point of (f) is to treat the supply\n\nof components for assembly abroad the same way\n\nas just making it here and then exporting it.\n\nBut that\u0027s an (a) case, and we think the rule\n\nof damages should be the same in both of them.\n\nAnd then I think in terms of our -­\n\nour theory, I think our -- our -- our principal\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\nsubmission is that when -- once you get to\n\ncompensatory damages, right, you have a\n\nplaintiff that is standing in front of the\n\ncourt and has already proven its case under\n\nU.S. law. It\u0027s proven that it\u0027s been wronged\n\nby the defendant. Right?

SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe presumption against\n\nextraterritoriality applies with particular\n\nforce to the Patent Act. And as the government\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nrecognized at least in its brief, the\n\npresumption applies independently to remedial\n\nprovisions as well as substantive ones because\n\nremedial provisions can create a similar risk\n\nof conflict with foreign law.\n\nNow, in our view, this case involves\n\nthe extraterritorial application of the\n\nremedial provision in the Patent Act, Section\n\n284, which by its terms has no extraterritorial\n\nreach. And while the act of infringement here,\n\nall of the parties now agree, was concededly\n\ndomestic, our submission is that the damages\n\nhere were, in fact, foreign. And, indeed,\n\nPetitioner repeatedly describes those damages\n\nas foreign.\n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose there\n\nwere a different business model and what the\n\nPetitioner did was to sell the device to\n\nothers, rather than to conduct the operation\n\nitself. And it\u0027s about ready to sell to X, a\n\nforeign company, and then ION sells the same\n\ndevice and takes the sale away.\n\nWould the Petitioner be entitled to\n\nthe lost profits from that sale?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"30","file_name":"WesternGeco LLC v.

And assume that\n\nNorway had coterminous patent laws to the\n\nUnited States. In this case, Norway would have\n\nthe ability to impose liability for direct\n\ninfringement on our customers, the ones who\n\nengaged in not just the combination but the\n\ndownstream use, and Norway would be able to go\n\nafter us under its equivalents to Section","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"47","file_name":"WesternGeco LLC v.

And I think that the\n\nproblem that the other side has, which was\n\nillustrated by Justice Gorsuch\u0027s question, is\n\nthat it can\u0027t point to anything that overcomes\n\nthe presumption.\n\nSure, Congress was thinking about the\n\npossibility of eventual foreign combinations\n\nwhen it enacted Section 271(f), but what it\n\ndidn\u0027t do was to attempt to regulate abroad.\n\nAnd this Court in Morrison and RJR has\n\nmade clear that it is not sufficient to\n\novercome the presumption simply that Congress\n\nmight have contemplated the possibility of\n\ndownstream foreign activity. Congress has to\n\ngive a clear and unmistakable indication of its\n\ndesire to have extraterritorial reach.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t have to necessarily do so\n\nin the language of the statute, though this\n\nCourt made clear in RJR Nabisco that it would\n\nbe a rare case where the presumption is\n\novercome in the absence of explicit statutory\n\nlanguage.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\u0027m sorry, did you\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\nsay earlier that if this sensor was\n\nmanufactured and sold from the United States to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"53","file_name":"WesternGeco LLC v.

CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nI\u0027d just like to clarify two details\n\nand make a couple of points.\n\nOne detail, my friend mistakenly\n\nreferred to this case being brought in the\n\nEastern District of Texas. It was, in fact,\n\nbrought in the Southern District of Texas,\n\nwhere both of these companies are located.\n\nIt may be a pedantic point, but the\n\nEastern District of Texas has a certain\n\nimplication to it that I wanted to clarify.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"56","file_name":"WesternGeco LLC v.
