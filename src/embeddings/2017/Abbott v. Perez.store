KELLER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS\n\nMR.\n\nKELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Texas legislature did not have a\n\nracially discriminatory purpose when it adopted\n\nthe entire court-ordered congressional remedial\n\nplan and virtually all of the remedial state\n\nhouse plan.\n\nThis Court told the district court to\n\norder districts that do not violate the\n\nConstitution or the VRA, and on remand in 2012,\n\nthe district court itself said it obeyed this\n\nCourt\u0027s remand and it fixed all plausible legal\n\ndefects under even the low Section 5 standard.\n\nAnd, indeed, today, with nine groups of\n\nplaintiffs here, we cannot draw a single\n\nadditional performing majority/minority\n\ndistrict, even though plaintiffs have tried for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nyears under both plans.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General Keller, I\n\nknow you want to get to the merits, but I don\u0027t\n\nwant to leave the jurisdiction question. And\n\nthis last point raises it for me in stark\n\nrelief, which is your -- you just said you\n\ncan\u0027t draw this map. The court below said you\n\ncan.\n\nBy not waiting for the remedy in this\n\ncase, we are not in a position to be fully\n\ninformed on that question.

true, but I think it\u0027s\n\n-- it\u0027s also true in pretty much all of these\n\ndistricting cases. In other words, in all of\n\nthese districting cases, once there\u0027s a\n\nliability finding, there\u0027s a finding that a\n\nparticular district is -- is drawn or more than\n\none district is drawn in a way that violates\n\nthe Constitution, the upshot of that is that\n\nyou\u0027re not going to be allowed to use those\n\ndistrict lines.\n\nBut still there\u0027s a remedial process\n\nthat takes place, where people argue about what\n\nthe proper remedy is, and only at the end of\n\nthat process, customarily, or at least it\n\nhappened this way here, is there an injunction\n\nput in place saying don\u0027t use this map, instead\n\nuse that map.\n\nAnd what I\u0027m concerned about is that\n\nif you\u0027re right, we\u0027re going to be hearing all\n\nof these districting cases not after the\n\nremedial stage but, instead, straight away\n\nafter the liability stage.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"9","file_name":"Abbott v.

This was not actually a\n\npreliminary injunction posture. Preliminary\n\ninjunctions had been granted in 2011.\n\nThe only reason that a lower standard\n\nwas being used here is because there were\n\ncollateral Section 5 proceedings, because this\n\nwas the unique posture where Section 5\n\npreclearance proceedings were ongoing. And,\n\nhere, the procedure in the district court, we\n\nhad discovery. There were dispositive motions.\n\nWe had two weeks of trial. There was\n\nan appeal to this Court with its Perry\n\ndecision. There was extensive briefing both\n\nbefore and after this Court\u0027s decision in\n\nPerry. There was the Section 5 briefing before\n\nthe district of D.C. There were two more days\n\nof argument on remand.\n\nAnd then, at that point, the district\n\ncourt in 2012 issued tens of pages of written\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"16","file_name":"Abbott v.

And third is\n\nprocess problems with respect to 2013 that\n\ncould give rise to an inference of\n\ndiscriminatory intent.\n\nI want to start with that 2011 bucket\n\nbecause it provides several pieces of relevant\n\ninformation under the Arlington Heights\n\nframework.\n\nFirst, the effect of a redistricting\n\nplan is, under Arlington Heights, an important\n\nplace to start, and the district court made\n\nextensive findings about the discriminatory\n\neffect that the 2011 House plan would have.\n\nAnd, as Mr. Hicks mentioned, the\n\nlegislature knew in 2013 that the intended\n\neffect had, in fact, manifested. The -- the\n\n2011 process and facts also provide historical\n\nevidence of discrimination, not historical\n\nevidence 10 years ago, 15 years ago.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"54","file_name":"Abbott v.

And take Congressional District 35,\n\nfor instance.\n\nThere, we had the best of reasons\n\npossible to believe that that had to be a\n\nmajority/minority district because that\u0027s\n\nprecisely what the district court imposed in\n\n2012, saying that that was a valid Section 2\n\ndistrict. And here we are now seven years\n\nlater, three trials, and two appeals to this\n\nCourt.\n\nWe would ask this Court to find that\n\nthe challenged districts are valid and reverse.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.
