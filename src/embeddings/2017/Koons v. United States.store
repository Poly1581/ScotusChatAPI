BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR.\n\nFISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn contrast to the case you just\n\nheard, the \"based upon\" question in this case\n\nturns on the -- how the substantial assistance\n\nprovision, codified at 18 U.S.C. Section\n\n3553(e), works. And, specifically, the key is\n\nwhether the government is correct when it says\n\nthat a judge imposing a sentence in this\n\nsituation shall disregard or entirely set aside\n\nthe guideline range calculated according to the\n\ndefendant\u0027s criminal history and offense level.\n\nAnd the answer to this question lies\n\ndirectly in the plain text of the statute. And\n\nthat text says the opposite of what the\n\ngovernment claims. And I\u0027m turning now to page\n\n3a, which is in the government\u0027s brief, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nappendix, and that\u0027s where the statute appears.\n\nAnd I just want to read to you the\n\noperative language of Section 3553(e). It\n\nsays: \"Such sentence shall be imposed in\n\naccordance with the guidelines and policy\n\nstatements issued by the Sentencing Commission\n\npursuant to section 994.\"\n\nSo, in other words, that text directs\n\nthe court straight to the guidelines, not away\n\nfrom the guidelines. And it says nothing about\n\ntethering a sentence to the mandatory minimum\n\nor somehow setting the guidelines aside.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"2","file_name":"Koons v.

So,\n\nfirst of all, remember, sometimes the guideline\n\nrange is going to be above the minimum, and\n\nsometimes it\u0027s going to be below, and sometimes\n\nit\u0027s going to straddle the minimum. So what\n\nSection 3553(e) does is says when the judge\n\ngrants a substantial assistance motion, the\n\njudge should then sentence that defendant like\n\nanyone else, which is go to the guideline\n\nrange.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"4","file_name":"Koons v.

But, yes, the court is directed to\n\njust sentence that defendant according to the\n\nguideline range, just as he would any other\n\ndefendant.\n\nAnd that makes perfect sense, because,\n\nagain, what Congress has done, remember, is set\n\nup a default regime of guided discretion under\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial\n\nthe guidelines as set by guideline ranges\n\naccording to offense level and criminal history\n\ncategories.

Remember, in\n\nMelendez, the Court talks about two different\n\ntypes of substantial assistance departures.\n\nOne is from the guideline range under 5K.

When Congress enacted\n\n3553(e) -- that was in 1986 -- there were no\n\nguidelines -- final guidelines that had been\n\npromulgated at that point.\n\nThe Commission had a great deal of\n\ndiscretion in how it might have decided to\n\nimplement 994(n), and it might have sprinkled\n\nsubstantial assistance reductions and ways of\n\ndoing that for particular types of crimes all\n\nover the guidelines.

something.\n\nWhat if the -- because they give you\n\nfive factors to consider.

One is\n\njust -- just as a practical matter, you would\n\nbe requiring the government to appeal even\n\nsentences it thought it was substantively fine\n\nwith and could live with, just to preserve down\n\nthe road some procedural objection to\n\n3582(c)(2) relief.\n\nAnd I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a great use\n\nof the courts of appeals\u0027 time or, frankly, the\n\n-- the government\u0027s own resources. But there\n\nare two statutory reasons why I don\u0027t think\n\nthat that approach is the right one.\n\nOne is the one I was discussing with\n\nJustice Sotomayor earlier, which is that I\n\ndon\u0027t think a sentence can be said to be based\n\non; that is, the legal foundation of -- the\n\nguidelines aren\u0027t the legal foundation of the\n\nsentence if they\u0027re not even the guidelines\n\nthat the -- the court was required to apply.\n\nSo, again, 3582(c)(2) -­\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don\u0027t quite\n\nunderstand that just as a matter of language,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"39","file_name":"Koons v.

FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, here, I\n\nthink \"based on a sentencing range\" actually\n\nhas a very specific meaning. As we point out\n\nin the first section of our brief and as\n\nPetitioners never really respond to in their\n\nreply brief, \"sentencing range\" is a term\n\nthat\u0027s only used in three different places in\n\nthe statute.\n\nAnd the -- I think the relevant places\n\nhere are, one, we see it in 3582(c)(2). We\n\nalso see it in Section 3553(a)(4) as the thing\n\nthat the guideline -- the number that the\n\nguidelines give back to you or the range of\n\nnumbers in most cases that the guidelines give\n\nback to you under 3553(a)(4).\n\nAnd I think \"based on the sentencing\n\nrange\" means that the number that 3553(a)(4)\n\ngave back to the district judge, when he\n\ncomputed the guidelines, was actually the\n\nnumber -- it should actually be that number.\n\nAnd where there was an error there, I don\u0027t\n\nthink 3582(c)(2) should be applied to give the\n\ndefendant further relief.\n\nAnd the reason for that is the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"40","file_name":"Koons v.

And so\n\nthat\u0027s what\u0027s driven them off the rails, is the\n\nexistence of (f).\n\nOur position, to start with as a\n\nstatutory matter, is (e) has to mean what it\n\nmeant for the first eight years before (f) was\n\never enacted; (f) can\u0027t have changed what (e)\n\nmeans.\n\nBut if you do want to compare them -­\n\nso we think you shouldn\u0027t compare them, but if\n\nyou do want to compare them, the operative\n\nlanguage in (f) is almost identical to the\n\noperative language in (e).
