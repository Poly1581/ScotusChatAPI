And the -- the Court\u0027s\n\ndecisions in this area have treated those -­\n\nthese two types of courts differently.\n\nAnd so, for example, Ex parte\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n37\n\nOfficial\n\nVallandigham or the Gordon versus United States\n\ncase, which we cite in our brief, are about\n\nmilitary courts and about the initial\n\nincarnation of the Court of Claims.\n\nAnd this Court denied jurisdiction and\n\nsaid that it could not directly review either\n\nof those courts.\n\nThat contrasts with the Court\u0027s\n\napproach to United States versus Coe from a\n\nterritorial court. And so there -- there must\n\nbe a line that can be drawn between territorial\n\ncourts and these other types of adjudicatory\n\nbodies that are within the executive branch.\n\nAnd I submit that the line that I have\n\nproposed is the easiest and best line that\n\nexplains all the cases, as well as allows the\n\n-- the court to say that all bodies that are\n\nwithin the executive branch cannot be subject\n\nto this Court\u0027s direct review.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"31","file_name":"Dalmazzi v.
