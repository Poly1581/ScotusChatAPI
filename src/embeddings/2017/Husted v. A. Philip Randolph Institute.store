For sending the notice.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Senate report\n\nthat supported the NVRA explicitly says that\n\nwhat they wanted to avoid was a mailing that is\n\nunresponded to being a cause for removing\n\nsomeone.\n\nSo if that was its purpose, why\n\nwouldn\u0027t it make sense that the only reason\n\nthat you can change -- send the notice is if\n\nyou have some reasonable basis to

You have a right not to\n\nvote.\n\nMR. MURPHY: So there\u0027s a -- there\u0027s a\n\ncouple points there. The first was what if\n\npeople do not respond to the notice.\n\nI agree that there is a Senate report\n\nsuggesting that they were concerned that people\n\nwould be removed merely for failing to respond,\n\nbut Congress did not put an objective evidence\n\nelement into the (d) procedure in response to\n\nthat concern.\n\nThey put in the safe harbor, what -­\n\nwhat they called the fail-safe voting on the\n\nback end. So if an individual doesn\u0027t respond,\n\nthey still have two federal elections in which\n\nthey can show up to vote.

there\u0027s nothing in this statute\n\nthat bars that.\n\nI think it reflects the\n\nbalance that Congress was trying to strike in\n\nthe NVRA between, on the one hand, dramatically\n\nincreasing the number of voters on the voter\n\nrolls but, on the other, giving states the\n\nflexibility they need to manage the issues that\n\narise when you have overinflated voter rolls.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it the position\n\nof the United States -- I thought it was, but\n\nyou correct me if I\u0027m wrong -- I thought that\n\n-- that the United States was taking the\n\nposition, consistently, that non-voting was not\n\na reliable indicator of residence change.\n\nGENERAL FRANCISCO: Your Honor, that\u0027s\n\npartly correct. Our prior position was based\n\non an understanding of the statute that read\n\ninto it a reliable evidence requirement, and we\n\nsaid that non-voting was not that kind of\n\nreliable evidence.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nOur current position is that when you\n\nlook at the statute, there\u0027s simply no way to\n\nread into it a reliable evidence requirement\n\nthat\u0027s found nowhere in the text and that\n\nCongress, in fact, rejected.

SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nI think it\u0027s important to recognize\n\nthat the Supplemental Process violates Section\n\n8 of the NVRA in two distinct ways. Of course,\n\nit violates the failure-to-vote clause, as\n\nwe\u0027ve been discussing, but it also violates\n\n8(a) because 8(a) sets out an exclusive list of\n\nfour bases that can be used for purging people\n\nfrom the rolls, and bars states from doing it\n\nunder any other circumstances.\n\nAnd the Supplemental Process, the way\n\nit is designed, it assures that many, indeed\n\nprobably most of the people who are purged,\n\nhave not moved, let alone moved to a different\n\ncounty or state, which is the only moves that\n\ncan justify a purge under the plain terms of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial\n\nthe NVRA.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"33","file_name":"Husted v.
