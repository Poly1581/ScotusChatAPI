There are approximately\n\n150 ALJs who fit that definition, which is not\n\nSocial Security ALJs, by the way, in the\n\nfederal government, in 25 agencies.\n\nSome of those may well have already\n\nbeen appointed.

And the\n\nExchange Act, Section 78d-1(a), explicitly\n\nadopts Section 556 of the APA for the judges.\n\nAnd I think it\u0027s important in the APA,\n\nCongress said that a formal adjudication, an\n\non-the-record adjudication under the APA, can\n\nbe done by three people only: The agency, a\n\nmember of the agency, or an ALJ.

And you propose\n\na test as to when we can get rid of the ALJs\n\non, I think it\u0027s Point 17 of your reply brief,\n\nthat seems to me does not guarantee them the\n\nindependence that the APA hoped for.\n\nSo how do I decide this case? If I\u0027m\n\ngoing to decide the PCAOB application first, I\n\nwould say, as I dissented, no, and at that\n\npoint, it doesn\u0027t matter very much and I can go\n\ninto the totally contradictory mess of what our\n\nprecedent is on this, I think.\n\nBut if the answer is yes, then I think\n\nI have to look for new approaches as to who is\n\na civil servant and who is an officer of the\n\nUnited States, in which Congress might play a\n\ngreat role.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"14","file_name":"Lucia v.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nThree brief points, if I may:\n\nFirst, every official who satisfied my\n\nfriend Mr. Metlitsky\u0027s test would be a\n\nprincipal officer of the United States.\n\nIf you can bind the government or\n\nprivate parties in your own name with no\n\nsupervision, that\u0027s a principal officer. This\n\nCourt rejected that as a test for inferior\n\nofficers in Edmond, which involved judges who\n\ncould never make final decisions unless their\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n65\n\nOfficial\n\nsuperiors allowed it.\n\nAnd the Weiss case, which involved\n\ntrial judges in the military whose opinions\n\nwere never final, which my friend never\n\nmentions and never cites in his briefs, because\n\nhe -- they cannot meet the finality test.\n\nIn any event, SEC ALJs do meet the\n\nfinality test. 78d-1 gives the Commission a\n\ndiscretionary right of review, which means it\n\nhas the discretion not to review, which means\n\nthey\u0027re statutorily authorized to enter final\n\ndecisions of the Commission.\n\nThe finality order, Your Honor, in a\n\ndiscretionary review scenario, it\u0027s like a cert\n\ndenied order from this Court. It says that the\n\nCommission is not reviewing, but the actual\n\ndecision that stands in his own name, by the\n\nway, Petition Appendix 237A, is Cameron\n\nElliot\u0027s signature on the decision he issued in","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"57","file_name":"Lucia v.
