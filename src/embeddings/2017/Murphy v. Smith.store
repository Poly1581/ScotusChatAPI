But the\n\n\"not to exceed\" language would be a strange\n\nthing for Congress to put in if it really meant\n\nthe plaintiff pays 25 percent, and, if the\n\njudgment is larger, the defendant pays the\n\nrest.\n\nMR. LEGNER: Well, Your Honor, the\n\nreason they use \"not to exceed\" is that there\n\nare cases where the plaintiff won\u0027t pay\n\n25 percent; for instance, where the fee award\n\nis equal to 17 percent of the judgment.\n\nSo, in that circumstance, the -- the\n\nfee award will be fulfilled, satisfied, with\n\nless than 25 percent of the judgment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"30","file_name":"Murphy v.
