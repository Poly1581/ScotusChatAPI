First,\n\nthe standard for assessing vagueness in the\n\nimmigration context is not the one that\u0027s\n\napplicable in criminal cases.\n\nImmigration removal is not a\n\npunishment for past conduct.

ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nLet me begin -- begin with Justice\n\nGorsuch\u0027s central point. Justice Gorsuch is\n\nright. This is not a job that Congress can\n\nappropriately delegate to the courts and to\n\nenforcement officials on the ground.\n\nCongress has written a statute that\n\nmakes it impossible for ordinary citizens or\n\nfor law enforcement or for immigration\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nofficials to figure out what the law is, and\n\nCongress has delegated that function to them.\n\nIt has done it with two features that\n\nthis Court described as dooming the ACCA\n\nresidual clause.\n\nFirst, the piece that most concerned\n\nthe Court, the Court said was most important,\n\nhypothesizing this ordinary case of a crime\n\nand, second, then estimating the risk\n\nassociated with that hypothesized version and\n\nwhether that meets some vague standard.\n\nThe government warned the Court in\n\nJohnson that section 16(b) was \"equally\n\nsusceptible to challenge.\" The government was\n\nright then, and the differences in statutory\n\nlanguage that the government has since\n\ndiscovered do not change the outcome.\n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, since","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"27","file_name":"Sessions v.
