ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L.\n\nFISHER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR.\n\nFISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis Court made clear in Kiobel that\n\nthe ATS should be construed first and foremost\n\naccording to the ordinary rules of statutory\n\nconstruction.\n\nAnd applying those tools here yields a\n\nstraightforward result. The traditional\n\npresumption that corporations can be held\n\nliable in civil actions for torts controls\n\nhere.\n\nNow, the bank\u0027s principal response is\n\nto say that the ATS sometimes can create\n\nformulations issues when cases are brought\n\nagainst corporations.

And you have to -- yeah.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: -- looking back to\n\n1789, as Sosa indicates we should, beyond\n\nextraterritoriality, did it also anticipate\n\nthat there\u0027s an American defendant in the case?\n\nProfessor Bellia and Clark argue that\n\nthat\u0027s exactly what was in mind, was some\n\naction by an American citizen that might be\n\ntagged to the United States itself and be cause\n\nfor just war by a foreign power, and that that\n\nwas the purpose of the ATS.\n\nSo what do you say about that? And\n\nthen relatedly, if international law was not\n\npart of the federal law itself in 1789, and I\n\nthink there is an argument that that\u0027s what the\n\nCongress understood too, then don\u0027t you need an\n\nAmerican defendant in order to have diversity\n\njurisdiction?\n\nMR.

And\n\nit sounds like the relation is the same as the\n\ninternational norm to the individual who struck\n\nthe French ambassador in the street.\n\nAnd then, similarly, the U.N.

what is your response?\n\nMR.\n\nCLEMENT: Well, I have multiple\n\nresponses, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, starting\n\nwith the concern in 1789 was that some\n\nindividual might strike the French ambassador.\n\nThere wasn\u0027t a concern that some\n\nartificial juridical entity would rise up and\n\nstrike the ambassador and then the question\n\nwould arise -­\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, really, but why\n\nwould it have mattered? Suppose that there was\n\na corporation that had a beef about the\n\nambassador and sent one of its employees to go\n\nstrike the ambassador and sent a judgment-proof\n\nemployee to go strike the ambassador.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why would France have\n\ncared?\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think France\n\nwould care that there would be some entity -­\n\nsome individual, probably the actual\n\ntort-feasor, which in that case would be the\n\nindividual who could be held responsible.\n\nAnd, of course, Congress had a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n46\n\nOfficial\n\nprovision for the judgment-proof tort-feasor,\n\nwhich they also in the Crimes Act of 1790 made\n\nit a criminal act.
