And\n\nwe think that Congress was doing something\n\ndeliberate when it used money in the RRTA but\n\ndidn\u0027t include parallel language in FICA.\n\nAnd at the time that the RRTA was\n\nenacted, railroad workers -- and it\u0027s discussed\n\nin the history and the hearings leading up to\n\nthe enactment of the RRTA -- they received a\n\nvariety of benefits that were sort of hard to\n\nvalue, couldn\u0027t readily be assigned a monetary\n\nvalue. And these included things like the\n\nright to have certain safety gear on the job\n\nand an unlimited but non-transferable sort of\n\nlifetime use of the rail\u0027s travel benefit.\n\nSo these are things that would have\n\nbeen hard to value, and we think the use of\n\nmoney carves those out of the RRTA, whereas\n\nthey weren\u0027t carved out with FICA.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you\n\nwould agree, wouldn\u0027t you, that not every form\n\nof stock qualifies under your definition?\n\nJustice Kennedy mentioned non-publicly","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"31","file_name":"Wisconsin Central Ltd. v.

as remuneration in money, which, of\n\ncourse, begs the question as to, well, what\u0027s\n\nmoney?\n\nAnd our point is that when Congress\n\nputs the word \"money\" in a tax statute, it\n\nunambiguously excludes stock. There\u0027s no\n\nquestion about that in the current code and the\n\ncode as it existed back in the Great\n\nDepression.\n\nThe second point is to the extent the\n\ngovernment argues that anything that can be\n\nvalued and sold for cash falls within this\n\ncapacious definition of money is wrong because\n\nI can think of many things that can be sold\n\nfaster for cash at a much lower transaction\n\ncost, for example, baseball tickets.\n\nIf I have two tickets to the Nationals\n\nand Rockies game, I can sell those and change\n\nthose into cash a lot faster than I could find\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\na broker and sell my shares of stock on a\n\nmarket.\n\nThe third point I would make, and I\n\nthink it\u0027s apropos since Tax Day is almost upon\n\nus, is the government, the IRS, requires that\n\nwe taxpayers pay our taxes in money.
