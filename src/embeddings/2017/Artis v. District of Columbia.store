Your Honor, it\u0027s true\n\nthat typically the state savings clause won\u0027t\n\nnecessarily be triggered, but there are\n\ncertainly many sets of facts in which it would\n\nbe triggered. First of all, a state could\n\nenact a tolling period that\u0027s even longer than\n\nthe federal tolling period. Louisiana, for\n\ninstance, actually restarts the clock.\n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But they couldn\u0027t\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nenact a shorter one?\n\nMR.

The Respondent\u0027s gives the states\n\nmaximum flexibility; states can have it any way\n\nthey want. But you don\u0027t give any protection\n\nto the states that don\u0027t want to have\n\nlong-delayed suits.\n\nMR.

And the effect of that is that\n\nit\u0027s true that under our position the state\n\ntolling -- the -- the savings clause will be\n\ntriggered less frequently under our view.

UNIKOWSKY: So let me answer that\n\nquestion. So the way I understand the phrase\n\n\"longer tolling period\" is that it would\n\nencompass a state statute that is the\n\narithmetic equivalent of a longer tolling\n\nperiod.\n\nSo the example in our reply brief we\n\ngive is as follows: Suppose you file a Texas\n\nsuit with five days left in the limitations\n\nperiod and Texas gives you a 60-day grace\n\nperiod. So the application of the 60-day grace\n\nperiod in that case is the arithmetic\n\nequivalent of a tolling period of the pendency\n\nof the federal suit plus 55 days because the\n\nfive more days will get you to 60.\n\nSo the way I interpret those words is\n\nthat that is a longer tolling period. Now,\n\nthat\u0027s debatable. You may disagree with me on\n\nthat, but our case certainly doesn\u0027t depend on\n\nthat.

Court in that opinion was\n\ndiscussing this old Civil War era statute which\n\nstopped the clock, and in the Court\u0027s opinion\n\nthe Court talked about that statute as tolling\n\nlimitations periods.\n\nSo, again, that\u0027s a pretty weak\n\ninference, too, but I just don\u0027t see anything\n\nin this opinion supporting the view that the\n\nCourt\u0027s decision was dependent on the fact that\n\nthe statute can only carry the grace period\n\ninterpretation.\n\nI think that -- I have been talking\n\nabout these, the Jinks case and the statutory\n\nhistory. I\u0027d like to focus a little bit on the\n\ntext because I actually think that the text is\n\nextremely clear that tolling means suspending.\n\nSo if I could just make two points\n\nabout the text. The first is that the statute\n\nsays that the period of limitations shall be\n\ntolled. Not the statute of limitations, not\n\nthe limitations bar, the period of limitations.\n\nSo Respondent\u0027s interpretation is that\n\nthe word tolled means removed.

We found\n\nsomething like one and a half such statutes.\n\nSo one statute we cite in our opening brief, 46\n\nU.S.C. 53911.

And\n\nI don\u0027t think there\u0027s much debate that in\n\ncontext those statutes have to stop the clock,\n\nbecause if a statute just says that while your\n\nadministrative claim is pending the period of\n\nlimitations is tolled, the only way that makes\n\nsense is if the clock stops.

I understand your\n\nargument would be a lot stronger if it said the\n\nstatute of limitations is tolled. But here it\n\nsays the period of limitation is tolled. And,\n\nto me, that means you\u0027re looking at the period\n\nand it\u0027s suspended, as opposed to just that the\n\nprovision specifying a period is tolled.\n\nMS. ALIKHAN: So I have two responses,\n\nMr. Chief Justice. The first is that in\n\nHeimeshoff this Court used interchangeably\n\nperiod of limitations and statute of\n\nlimitations. So we don\u0027t think there is\n\nanything significant about the use of period\n\nrather than statute here.

want to get back to just\n\nthe structure of the statute as a whole because\n\nI think that the provision of this 30-day\n\nperiod, because it is a rarity within the U.S.\n\nCode, suggests Congress was doing something\n\nother than stop-clock tolling.\n\nAnd I think combined with this\n\nself-conscious legislation that defers to state\n\ntolling periods, of which this Court was aware,\n\nof which Congress was aware, when they were\n\nenacting this statute.\n\nAnd so 1367(d) is a precise fit to the\n\nproblem created by 1367(c).

It says that the running of the -- of\n\nthe clock is suspended while this\n\nadministrative claim is pending and for 60\n\ndays. And so I think that just underscores\n\nthat tolling of a period of limitations means\n\none thing.
