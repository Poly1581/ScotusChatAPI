First, he did not use Patient\n\nL\u0027s name in relation to his healthcare fraud\n\noffense.

So the name is not essential to\n\ncommit the crime.\n\nBut I would add to that, even if the\n\nname were essential to commit the crime, we\n\nstill think that\u0027s too low a bar for \"in\n\nrelation to.\"  And, as we point out, one example\n\nis, if all you need is a but-for relationship to\n\nsatisfy the \"in relation to\" element, then every\n\nmail or wire fraud case that has a name on an\n\nenvelope or a name in the e-mail address or the\n\nphone number becomes identity theft.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn\u0027t that why --\n\nMR.

That answer\n\nviolates their own rule.\n\nTheir rule is you have to have\n\nspecific authorization to the exact thing you\n\ndid in the manner you did it. So you would not\n\nask whether somebody has authorization to send\n\nan unsolicited letter.  You\u0027d ask whether\n\nsomebody has authorization to send a fraudulent\n\nletter, and the answer to that would be no, just\n\nlike here.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  But why isn\u0027t that\n\nright?

Well, let me say two\n\nthings, Justice Kagan.\n\nFirst of all, with due\n\nrespect to the dissent in Yates, I\u0027m not looking\n\nto use the title as -- as -- as aggressively as\n\nthere. Really, there, the word \"records\" did\n\nlimit the language quite directly.\n\nHere, I\u0027m just saying it gives you a\n\nlens through which to understand the words, and\n\nI think that is well in the Court\u0027s mainstream\n\nof cases, majority or dissents.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, when\n\nyou look at the word \"theft,\" I\u0027ve gone through\n\nburglary statute -- not burglary statute -- a\n\nvariety of different state statutes, and theft\n\nis always defined as transfers, possessions, or\n\nuse.\n\nSo it\u0027s not as if the title is not in\n\nthe very words of the statute.  Most theft\n\nstatutes are using transfer, possession, or\n\nusing of someone else\u0027s property, correct?\n\nMR.

FISHER: Well, I think, if the\n\nexact same bill had been submitted to Medicaid\n\nwithout Patient L\u0027s name on it, it likely would\n\nhave still been healthcare fraud.  It would have\n\nviolated Section 1347 because it covers\n\nartifices and schemes that attempt to defraud\n\nthe government.  So, even if the bill had not\n\nbeen paid, it still would have been healthcare\n\nfraud.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito?\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose we think that\n\n\"without lawful authority\" can plausibly be read\n\nin a number of different ways.

SURI\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. SURI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nI\u0027d like to start with the\n\nhypothetical that Justice Jackson was discussing\n\nwith Mr. Fisher about the waiter who uses a\n\ncustomer\u0027s credit card to bill for something\n\nthat the customer didn\u0027t order.  Let\u0027s say the\n\ncustomer ordered steak, and the waiter uses the\n\ncredit card to ring up a bottle of wine as well.\n\nAnd I think the discussion earlier\n\ntoday established that the waiter was acting\n\nwithout lawful authority.  He had the authority\n\nto use the credit card number to bill only for\n\nthe food that was ordered.  He didn\u0027t have the\n\nauthority to use it for other things, whether it\n\nbe wine or Amazon.com products or paying down\n\nhis mortgage.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\nhttps://Amazon.com\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"58","file_name":"Dubin v.

SURI: Yes, Justice Alito.  I\n\nthink that the presence of the term \"possess\"\n\nstrongly supports our interpretation, and the\n\nreason is that it would be quite odd for this\n\nstatute to prohibit the passive possession of\n\nanother person\u0027s name, to prohibit a\n\nparticularly egregious type of use, namely, use\n\nfor the purpose of impersonation, but to cover\n\nnothing in between the active uses that fall\n\nshort of impersonation.  There\u0027s no reason to\n\nthink Congress would have included that\n\ndiscontinuity in the statute.\n\nIn addition, I think Justice Barrett\n\nraised the question that \"transfer and possess\"\n\ncould be read to refer to circumstances in which\n\nthe information is stolen.  And I agree with\n\nthat.\n\nBut \"use\" has to be doing some\n\nindependent work.  If you\u0027ve stolen the\n\ninformation, you\u0027ve already possessed it without\n\nlawful authority.

let me turn to the scope and the\n\nconsequences of this very broad position that\n\nthe government has endorsed, and I think the\n\ngovernment stood here and said yes, every\n\nmischarge by a waiter, a cashier, et cetera,\n\nconstitutes -- that -- that violates the mail or\n\nwire fraud statute would fall within our\n\nunderstanding.  That\u0027s an incredibly broad\n\nsweep.\n\nI heard some resistance about the\n\nhealthcare fraud statute.

We point out that\n\nthe examples the government gave would require\n\nthe use of somebody\u0027s name.  So, again, I heard\n\ntoday the notion of applying for Medicare\n\nbenefits and then lying or Medicaid benefits and\n\nlying about your age or your smoking.\n\nBut, to do that application, you have\n\nto list your doctor, your employer, a contact at\n\nyour employer.  You\u0027re putting names all over\n\nthat form.
