CLEMENT: Sure.  So, if you start\n\nwith the -- the typical case, where the agency\n\nbuilds an administrative record that informs\n\ntheir position on a particular transaction, all\n\nof the claims here are sort of cross-cutting or\n\nmay be even logically anterior to any of that\n\nprocess.\n\nOne of the due process claims goes to\n\nthe clearance process by which a transaction\n\ngoes before the FTC rather than the Justice\n\nDepartment, and that claim obviously doesn\u0027t\n\nreally focus on FTC agency action, but it\n\nfocuses on executive branch action that\u0027s beyond\n\nthe FTC.\n\nAnd then, as to the more structural\n\nclaims, I mean, those are beyond the competence\n\nof the agency for two reasons.  One, no agency\n\nhas the authority to declare itself\n\nunconstitutional.

CLEMENT: So, Justice Kagan, I\u0027m\n\nreally arguing to win this case on the Thunder\n\nBasin factors.  That seems to be the\n\nstraightforward way to win the case.\n\nIf -- if I can just say a moment about\n\nthe broader arguments, I think, if you look at\n\nthe statutes, if the Court were drawing on a\n\nclean slate, I would probably say the right way\n\nto decide these cases is, of course, there\u0027s\n\njurisdiction, and there\u0027s a whole host of\n\nnon-jurisdictional doctrines, like ripeness and\n\nexhaustion, that would probably get you to\n\nalmost the exact same result as the Thunder\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n9\n\nOfficial\n\nBasin factors.\n\nSo, if I were a law professor, I might\n\nquibble that these factors that the Court has\n\ncome up with for jurisdiction really should go\n\nto non-jurisdictional factors and these cases\n\nshould be resolved on B-6 rather than B-1, but\n\nI\u0027m not a law professor.  I\u0027m here to represent\n\na client. And I think our client wins well\n\nunder the Thunder Basin factors. So we\u0027re happy\n\nto win on -- on those factors.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, almost\n\nany administrative process could be called","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"6","file_name":"Axon Enterprise, Inc. v.

STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIt is a longstanding principle of\n\nadministrative law that courts will not\n\nintervene in an ongoing agency proceeding until\n\nthat proceeding culminates in a rule or order\n\nthat imposes sanctions or determines legal\n\nrights or obligations.\n\nConsistent with that principle, the\n\nFTC Act review provisions governing\n\nadjudications authorize court of appeals review\n\nonly of the final Commission orders that\n\nterminate the proceedings.  The APA confirms\n\nthat this review mechanism is excluse --\n\nexclusive and further confirms that antecedent\n\nsteps taken during the adjudications are subject\n\nto review on the review of the final agency\n\naction.  Those provisions, taken together, make\n\nclear that district courts have no authority to\n\nentertain constitutional challenges to the\n\nCommission\u0027s conduct of agency adjudications.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"41","file_name":"Axon Enterprise, Inc. v.

STEWART: I mean, I -- I think the\n\nfirst factor under the text of the APA is the\n\nmost important factor because it says \"you use\n\nthe special statutory review procedure unless\n\nit\u0027s inadequate.\"\n\nI -- another category of cases that I\n\nhaven\u0027t mentioned in which the collateral factor\n\ncould be relevant is suppose that at the same\n\ntime Axon had a pending adjudication the\n\nCommission issued a rule, a regulation that\n\ncaused Axon separate harm.\n\nThere is a separate provision of the\n\nFTC Act that authorizes court of appeals review\n\nof regulations, and that sort of dispute would\n\nclearly be collateral to the adjudication.  It\n\nwould be a step -- a legal dispute between --\n\nwith between the regulated party and the same\n\nagency.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"73","file_name":"Axon Enterprise, Inc. v.

And, I mean,\n\nMathews versus Eldridge dealt with a very\n\nspecific fact pattern:  In -- individuals who\n\nhad been receiving Social Security disability\n\nbenefits were informed that they were -- that\n\nthe relevant agency considered them no longer to\n\nbe disabled, and, therefore, their benefits\n\nwould be terminated.\n\nAnd the specific complaint in Mathews\n\nversus Eldridge was \"my benefits were terminated\n\nbefore I received a hearing.\"  They were still\n\nentitled to a hearing down the road, and they\n\ncould get retroactive benefits if their benefits\n\nwere terminated, and then, at the end of the\n\nday, they were found to be entitled.  But there\n\nwould be an interruption of the stream of\n\nbenefits.\n\nAnd the Court said \"that\u0027s\n\nsufficiently collateral to the overall\n\nproceedings that you don\u0027t have to use the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n84\n\nOfficial\n\nreview mechanism that you would use after your\n\nbenefits claim was finally resolved.\"\n\nBut I think that case really has a\n\nclose resemblance to the collaterals -- I mean\n\nthe temporary cease-and-desist order that I","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"75","file_name":"Axon Enterprise, Inc. v.

on page 36 of his brief, Mr.\n\nClement points out that Axon\u0027s beef is not that\n\nit must pay an invalid fine or should not lose a\n\njob on an unconstitutional basis, like the\n\nclaims in Thunder Basin and Elgin, that the\n\nHeritage Reporting

facts.\n\nNow Justice Sotomayor pointed out\n\nearlier that even a -- a structural challenge to\n\nthe agency is a means of escaping from an\n\nultimate order.  It\u0027s -- it\u0027s a challenge that\n\nyou can make to get out from under it. But I\n\ntake Mr. Clement\u0027s point to be that, listen, the\n\nmost we get is a do-over. So this isn\u0027t just\n\nabout having to endure the expense and the\n\ninconvenience of proceedings before we can\n\nultimately challenge them and get relief.  It\u0027s\n\nthat the relief that we get in the end isn\u0027t an\n\nultimate out from liability, but it\u0027s simply\n\nsaying, if you want to come after us again, you\n\nhave to do it in a properly constituted agency.\n\nIs that an argument that you find\n\npersuasive on the meaningful review point?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"82","file_name":"Axon Enterprise, Inc. v.

Just a few\n\npoints in rebuttal.\n\nFirst of all, my friend on the other\n\nside is very focused on the APA and review of\n\nagency action, but, of course, here, we\u0027re not\n\nreally challenging agency action as such.\n\nWe are challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of statutes that insulate\n\nagency officials from presidential removal, and\n\nwe\u0027re challenging the assignment process, the\n\nclearance process that actually precedes any\n\nagency action by the FTC.\n\nMy friend loves the Standard Oil case,\n\nbut the Standard Oil case, of course, is a\n\nfinality case.  It\u0027s not, strictly speaking, a\n\njurisdictional case.  And it also illustrates\n\nhow different this case is from that.\n\nIn that case, what Standard Oil\u0027s beef\n\nwas about was about the initiation of a\n\ncomplaint.  They said we\u0027re so innocent from all\n\nof this you shouldn\u0027t have even initiated a\n\ncomplaint.\n\nWell, of course, that is unripe -- an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n94\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"84","file_name":"Axon Enterprise, Inc. v.
