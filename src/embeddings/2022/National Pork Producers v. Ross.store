States routinely enact that kind\n\nof law.  And, Justice Barrett, at least 24\n\nstates have done so to serve local moral\n\ninterests.  Sales restrictions often have\n\nupstream out-of-state effects, but they\u0027re\n\npermissible as long as the condition on in-state\n\nsales focuses on the actual process for\n\nproducing the goods sold in the regulating\n\nstate.\n\nIn this case, Prop 12\u0027s sow housing\n\nrestrictions are tied to the production process","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"83","file_name":"National Pork Producers v.

But we\u0027d also look at whether the market\n\nrecognizes things as distinct products based on\n\ntheir morality.  And the market here and\n\nregulators here distinguish inhumanely raised\n\ncrated-pork from humanely raised pork.\n\nCompanies look at it.
