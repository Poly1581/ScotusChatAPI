WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nJASTA permits any U.S. national\n\ninjured by reason of an act of international\n\nterrorism to recover treble damages from a\n\nperson who aids and abets by knowingly providing\n\nsubstantial assistance or who conspires with the\n\nperson who committed such an act of\n\ninternational terrorism.\n\nThe foundational points here are not\n\nin dispute.  First, the conceded and obvious act\n\nof international terrorism is the Reina attack,\n\nand the complaint includes no allegation that\n\nthe defendants provided substantial assistance,\n\nmuch less knowing substantial assistance, to\n\nthat attack or, for that matter, to any other\n\nattack.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nSecond, as the complaint concedes, the\n\ndefendants \"had no intent to aid ISIS\u0027s\n\nterrorist activities.\"  Quite to the contrary,\n\nthey maintained and regularly enforced policies\n\nprohibiting content that promotes terrorist\n\nactivity.\n\nThe plaintiff\u0027s claim that because\n\ndefendants were generally aware that among their\n\nbillions of users were ISIS adherents who\n\nviolated their policies and, therefore,\n\ndefendants should have done more to enforce\n\nthose policies does not constitute aiding and\n\nabetting an act of international terrorism under","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Twitter, Inc. v.

The word that appears\n\nover and over and over again is \"the act of\n\ninternational terrorism\" that injured the\n\nplaintiff.\n\nNumber two, Congress in its findings\n\nsaid that it intended to import the legal\n\nframework set forth in a section of Halberstam\n\nconveniently called \"Legal Framework.\"  Again,\n\nthere is nothing in the legal framework set out\n\nthere that talks about aiding and abetting or\n\nsubstantially assisting an enterprise.  In any\n\nevent, we don\u0027t in any way contest that the\n\ncourt, in applying the facts in Halberstam to\n\nthe legal framework, referred over and over\n\nagain to the substantial assistance that she was\n\nproviding to the enterprise.\n\nNow the word \"enterprise,\" if you look\n\nin the dictionary, has a variety of different\n\nmeanings, but the two first meanings are, number\n\none, it can refer to an entity that is typically\n\na \"unit of economic organization,\" or, quite\n\ndistinctly, it can refer to an undertaking,\n\nsystemic, purposeful activity.\n\nWhat Halberstam was using the term to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"17","file_name":"Twitter, Inc. v.
