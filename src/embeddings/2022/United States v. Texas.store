Federal courts should not\n\nnow be transformed into open forums for each and\n\nevery policy dispute between the states and the\n\nnational government.\n\nOn the merits, the INA does not create\n\nan unyielding mandate to apprehend and remove\n\nevery non-citizen described in provisions that\n\nuse the term \"shall.\"  This Court has repeatedly\n\nheld that the word \"shall\" does not displace\n\nbackground principles of enforcement discretion.\n\nAcross 25 years and five presidential\n\nadministrations, the agency has never\n\nimplemented the INA in the manner that\n\nRespondents suggest.  Given congressional\n\nfunding choices, it would be impossible for DHS\n\nto do so.\n\nAdopting Respondents\u0027 reading would\n\nnot lead to more immigration enforcement.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"United States v.

Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd I -- I take -- I know you have a response to\n\nthat, but we don\u0027t need to go into it now.\n\nBut -- but I think your position is,\n\ninstead of judicial review, Congress has to\n\nresort to shutting down the government or\n\nimpeachment or dramatic steps if it -- if some\n\nadministration comes in and says we\u0027re not going\n\nto enforce laws or at least not going to enforce\n\nthe laws to the degree that Congress by law has\n\nsaid the laws should be enforced, and -- and\n\nthat\u0027s forcing -- I mean, I understand your\n\nposition, but it\u0027s forcing Congress to take\n\ndramatic steps, I think.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I think that\n\nif those dramatic steps would be warranted, it\n\nwould be in the face of a dramatic abdication of\n\nstatutory responsibility by the executive.\n\nAnd there\u0027s a reason we don\u0027t see that\n\nthroughout our history because of those\n\npolitical checks that prevent the executive from\n\ntaking those kinds of actions.  And it would be\n\nlike saying, if the President decided to pardon\n\nevery federal criminal and release them all,\n\nobviously, no one could sue about that, but\n\nthere\u0027s a reason that doesn\u0027t happen.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"47","file_name":"United States v.

fundamentally\n\nmisunderstands the difference between a\n\ndeclaratory judgment and vacatur.  If the\n\ndistrict court here had entered a declaratory\n\njudgment, we would have still had the\n\nenforcement priorities and DHS would have been\n\nentitled to rely on those while it continued to\n\npursue its appeal rights. It\u0027s not a course of\n\nremedy.\n\nVacatur stands in an entirely\n\ndifferent posture because the district court\n\nvoided the Guidelines, and that prevented DHS\n\nofficials from being able to continue to rely on\n\nthose while the case was litigated, and that is\n\nprecisely contrary to the judgment that Congress\n\nmade in 1252(f)(1).\n\nOn the merits, make no mistake it is\n\nimpossible for DHS to comply with each and every\n\n\"shall\" in the INA if that is truly a judicially\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n148\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nenforceable duty.
