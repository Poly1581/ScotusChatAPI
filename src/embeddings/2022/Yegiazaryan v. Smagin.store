This makes sense.  Congress\n\nlegislated to address domestic concerns and to\n\nprotect U.S. persons, and this bright-line rule\n\nensures that U.S.-domiciled plaintiffs will have\n\na right to sue under RICO.

So thank\n\nyou.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, can I ask\n\nyou why you focus so much on the First\n\nRestatement when the Second Restatement was\n\nadopted before RICO was passed?\n\nMR. LEVY: Yeah.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  And the Second\n\nRestatement marked kind of a sea change in the\n\nway that we think about conflicts of laws, in\n\nparticular, a multifactor test that\u0027s more\n\nsimilar to the one proposed by your friend on\n\nthe other side.\n\nSo why should we care about the First\n\nRestatement?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"18","file_name":"Yegiazaryan v.
