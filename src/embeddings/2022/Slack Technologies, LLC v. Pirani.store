First, there\u0027s no\n\nreference in Section 12 to registration; second,\n\nSection 12 clearly covers some unregistered\n\nshares because it ropes in Section 3 securities;\n\nthird, Section 12 refers to sales not only by\n\nmeans of a prospectus but also by means of oral\n\ncommunication, which would suggest that we\u0027re\n\noutside the world of registration; and, fourth,\n\nSection 12 creates liabilities for sellers who\n\nhad absolutely nothing to do with the\n\nregistration statement, so the class of people\n\nwho -- who might be liable is very different and\n\nis not connected to the registration statement.\n\nAnd what that suggests to me is that","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"33","file_name":"Slack Technologies, LLC v.

One is I think a premise of your question\n\nis that registration statements identify\n\nspecifically identifiable shares, and that\u0027s not\n\nthe case.\n\nSo, if you look at the Slack\n\nregistration statement here and look at the\n\nshares of CEO Butterfield, they say he has 41\n\nmillion shares and he\u0027s registering 11 million\n\nof them.\n\nThere\u0027s no way you can tell from that\n\nregistration statement which are the 11 million\n\nand which are the 30 million that aren\u0027t\n\nregistered.  Yet they would have my client have\n\nto prove, even though we know for sure, even if\n\nhe paid $40 directly to Mr. Butterfield and got\n\na share, he could not tell whether that share\n\nwas registered under this registration statement\n\nor not, and that\u0027s because registration\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\nstatements pave the way for public offerings.\n\nThey do not register individual shares.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he\n\ncan\u0027t -- the reason he can\u0027t is because the\n\nstatute says \"such security.\"  I mean, that\u0027s","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"53","file_name":"Slack Technologies, LLC v.

Thank you.\n\nI appreciate\n\nthat.\n\nWe -- we strongly dispute the premise.\n\nThe body of law that they are describing does\n\nnot hold that plaintiffs have to show that every\n\nHeritage Reporting

that you\n\nsaid was misleading as opposed to issued under\n\nsome registration statement a few years earlier\n\nthat could have been entirely accurate.  None of\n\nthose cases decide the question presented here.\n\nSometimes they use language about\n\nregistered shares, but it doesn\u0027t matter.  It\n\ndidn\u0027t matter in that case because they weren\u0027t\n\ndrawing a distinction between registered shares\n\nand exempt shares that were issued as part of a\n\nregistered offering because it simply didn\u0027t\n\nmatter in that case.\n\nIf I could turn again to Section 12\n\nfor a moment, you know, I do think that the\n\nplain language of the statute just directly\n\nanswers the questions here.  This is not at all\n\nsurprising that Congress would say that if you\n\nuse a misleading prospectus to sell a security,\n\nit doesn\u0027t matter whether you\u0027re using it to\n\nsell a registered security or a -- an exempt\n\nsecurity.

that means, as everyone has\n\nunderstood for the past many decades, that in\n\nthe case of an IPO, once there are exempt shares\n\non the market, the plaintiff must trace in order\n\nto bring a Section 11 claim.  And as I said at\n\nthe beginning, Respondent does not cite a single\n\ncase to the contrary in the 90-year history of\n\nthe Act.  So the idea that somehow the norm is\n\nthat people can bring suits in those\n\ncircumstances is patently incorrect.\n\nThe SEC has -- counsel suggests that\n\nthe SEC\u0027s position is not clear and does not\n\naddress the question at issue here.  That\u0027s\n\nsimply incorrect.  Here\u0027s what the SEC told this\n\nCourt in the Herman \u0026 MacLean case:  A plaintiff\n\nmay seek relief under Section 11 only with\n\nrespect to securities covered by the\n\nregistration statement.\n\nThere\u0027s no doubt, and, in fact, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n80\n\nOfficial\n\nCourt -- the SEC actually went on to say, even\n\nthough there could be outstanding securities of\n\nthe same class, that there would still not be\n\nliability even if people had relied on the\n\nregistration statement with respect to those\n\nother shares.  So the SEC\u0027s position is\n\nperfectly clear.\n\nRespondent says that this was a public\n\noffering of the exempt shares.  That\u0027s simply\n\nnot true.
