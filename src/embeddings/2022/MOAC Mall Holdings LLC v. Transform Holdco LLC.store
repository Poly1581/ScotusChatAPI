HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nBecause of the harsh consequences of\n\ndesignating a procedural prerequisite\n\njurisdictional, this Court requires a clear\n\nindication from Congress before it will treat a\n\nlimit as such.\n\nNothing in the text, structure, or\n\ncontext of Section 363(m) suggests, much less\n\nclearly reflects, that Congress ex -- intended\n\nthe absence of a stay to deprive the appellate\n\ncourts of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the\n\ntext explicitly presupposes the exercise of\n\nappellate jurisdiction, including to reverse or\n\nmodify a sale order.  The provision merely\n\nlimits the remedial consequences of such a\n\nruling and then only if there was no stay.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nTransform\u0027s few appellate decisions\n\nconcerning an earlier rule of bankruptcy\n\nprocedure do not provide a clear indication of\n\ncon -- jurisdictional character.

There, the question involved a child\u0027s\n\ncustody.  The child had during litigation\n\nbecause there was no stay pending appeal been\n\nremoved to Scotland.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you, counsel.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\n\nFollowing up on Chafin, if I\u0027m remembering\n\ncorrectly, the Court went on a little bit about\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial\n\nhow narrow the issues that would be available in\n\nthe proceeding would be.\n\nMR.

A\n\nparty like Transform comes to the court, asks\n\nfor an order.  It\u0027s subject to the court\u0027s\n\npersonal jurisdiction because that was a term of\n\nthe APA, consent to the personal jurisdiction of\n\nthe bankruptcy court, that if the court undoes\n\nit, then Transform will have to honor that\n\norder.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"19","file_name":"MOAC Mall Holdings LLC v.

And I think that\n\nthere can be some concern because of the\n\nredressability prong under Article III, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\nArticle III analysis, that relief should play\n\ninto that.  We think that Steel Co. squarely\n\naddresses this at page 96, where the Court\n\nexplained that a statutory restriction on\n\nrelief, the question doesn\u0027t usually affect\n\njurisdiction because the question under the\n\nredressability analysis is not whether a party\n\nis entitled to the relief that it\u0027s seeking but,\n\nrather, whether, if they are able to obtain that\n\nrelief, it will truly redress their -- their\n\ninjury.

lease. Sears built the building, not\n\nMOAC. Decades later, in 2018, when Sears filed\n\nfor bankruptcy, the building that Sears built\n\nwith this ground lease became property of the\n\nbankruptcy estate of Sears\u0027 bankruptcy estate.\n\nSears moved for authority to sell by\n\nprivate contract this property to Transform.\n\nAfter the necessary approvals from the\n\nbankruptcy court were obtained, that sale\n\ntransaction closed on October 4, 2019, three\n\nyears ago, and it was a sale, as the district\n\ncourt determined.  It was a transfer of\n\nownership of property for a price.\n\nThere was additional consideration\n\nthat was paid for this specific asset, this\n\nbuilding and this lease, millions of dollars in\n\nadditional consideration that\u0027s elaborated on\n\npages 13 to 14 of the red brief.\n\nOkay.

must be some tangible remedy that\n\nthey must be able to get.\n\nThey cannot.\n\nWholly\n\napart from Section 363 --\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that\u0027s just\n\nassuming the conclusion.  I mean, that\u0027s exactly\n\nwhat we would be asking -- you know, we would be\n\nsaying there are a bunch of other issues in this\n\ncase, and one of them is whether there\u0027s any\n\npossibility of relief remaining, and, you guys,\n\nthe lower courts, go decide that.\n\nMR. BRUNSTAD:  But, Justice Kagan, in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\nthe Tempnology decision that Your Honor\n\nauthored, you -- at the very beginning of that\n\ndecision, Your Honor said, well, is there a\n\ncontractual breach remedy here?  And you thought\n\nthere was enough evidence that there was to then\n\nreach the question of whether Section 365 breach\n\nequals rescission.  And Your Honor said it\n\ndoesn\u0027t. Very similar here, similar to the one\n\nthat Your Honor rejected in that decision.\n\nBut the threshold question under case\n\nor controversy jurisprudence is, is there some\n\nsort of tangible relief, something they can get\n\nout of actually prevailing?  And, here, the\n\nanswer is no. The sole relief they want is to\n\ntake away the property.  And they also want a\n\nforfeiture.  They\u0027ve said so themselves.  It\n\njust simply goes back to them.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"45","file_name":"MOAC Mall Holdings LLC v.

They did not challenge that on\n\nappeal, so that isn\u0027t established.  Plus,\n\nthere\u0027s no basis for it.\n\nBut, to Your Honor\u0027s point, this is a\n\nuniquely worded statute for a reason.  It\n\ncodifies an historic practice, and the historic\n\npractice informs what this statute is. Congress\n\ncodified the rule, and the rule reflected a\n\nuniform body of case law that refused to even\n\nhear these appeals if there wasn\u0027t a stay where\n\nyou\u0027re challenging the validity of the sale.\n\nThat was what Congress intended to do.\n\nSo I think it\u0027s important to sort of\n\ntake a look at that.  I understand the clear\n\nstatement rule, but, again, I would qualify\n\nthat. That makes sense and is easily applied\n\nwhen you have a procedural requirement, is that\n\njurisdictional or not. Again, here, we have a\n\nuniquely worded statute with intended\n\njurisdictional consequences.

It said we hold, in an in rem\n\nforfeiture action, the court of appeals is not\n\ndivested of jurisdiction by the prevailing\n\nparty\u0027s transfer of the res out of the court.\n\nThis Court rejected precisely the rule they have\n\ncited. So perhaps they are suggesting there is\n\na bankruptcy-specific rule to the same effect.\n\nWe cite at page 18 of the reply brief\n\nseveral cases in the courts of appeals that\n\nconcern this issue, and they say that if the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n77\n\nOfficial\n\ntransferee is not a party to the proceeding,\n\nthen the court cannot order it back.
