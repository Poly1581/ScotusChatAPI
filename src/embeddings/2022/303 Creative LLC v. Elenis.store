WAGGONER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMS. WAGGONER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nLorie Smith blends art with technology\n\nto create custom messages using words and\n\ngraphics.  She serves all people, deciding what\n\nto create based on the message, not who requests\n\nit. But Colorado declares her speech a public\n\naccommodation and insists that she create and\n\nspeak messages that violate her conscience.\n\nThis Court rejects such\n\ngovernment-compelled speech.  In Hurley, the\n\nCourt considered a very similar issue, asking\n\ntwo questions:  Is there speech, and is the\n\nmessage affected?  That test is easily met here.\n\nColorado agrees Ms. Smith creates speech, and\n\nthe law undeniably affects her message.  She\u0027s\n\nnot asking this Court to create new law but to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\napply its precedent.\n\nColorado first says this case is about\n\na sale.  It\u0027s not just about a sale.  The state\n\nforces Ms. Smith to create speech, not simply\n\nsell it.\n\nNext, Colorado says it can compel\n\nspeech on the same topic.

They do\n\nit in sepia tone and they are customizing each\n\none. This is not off a rack.

creating.  I\n\nmean, you\u0027re on your strongest ground when\n\nyou\u0027re talking about her sitting down and\n\ndesigning and coming up with the graphics to\n\ncustomize them for the couple.  So let me just\n\nclarify exactly what your position is on things\n\nthat are already created in the past.\n\nWhat if it is plug-and-play?  I don\u0027t\n\nknow that much about website design, so I don\u0027t\n\nknow how it could be plug-and-play.

She -- she does the\n\nprogramming, the coding.  She has stock\n\npictures.  And she sells that as a product, and\n\nthe customers, you know, Mike and Henry or, you\n\nknow, Lilly and Luke, fill it in themselves.  Is\n\nthat protected?\n\nMS. WAGGONER:  It is not protected in\n\nthe same way that if you sold a Bible\n\ncommentary, you wouldn\u0027t be able to decide\n\nwhether the Bible commentary will be burned or\n\nit will be used in a church service.  The stream\n\nof commerce, it\u0027s been put in the stream of\n\ncommerce at that point.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"44","file_name":"303 Creative LLC v.

I understand that.\n\nWhat I\u0027m interested in is, when you\n\nare talking about public accommodations laws\n\ndirectly or indirectly regulating speech, is\n\nthere a tradition of that?

They all\n\nare laws of general applicability that apply to\n\nall those operating a trade to the public.  They\n\ndon\u0027t say except those engaged in expressive\n\nconduct.\n\nAnd, with that framework, we do not\n\nsee a history of cases where people raise their\n\nhand and say it shouldn\u0027t apply to me because\n\nI\u0027m speaking.  And so I think the public\n\naccommodations brief on our side in this case\n\nsets that out quite nicely.  But -- but there is\n\nno case from 150 years ago that comes out either\n\nway with this exact issue.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"57","file_name":"303 Creative LLC v.

FLETCHER:  So I guess here is the\n\nway I\u0027d answer the question, is -- is the way\n\nthat Hurley did.  We read Hurley to ask is the\n\ncompulsion, is the burden on speech, is it truly\n\nincidental to the content-neutral regulation of\n\nconduct.\n\nAnd what Hurley started with on pages\n\n572 to 573 is being emphatic in saying this\n\nparade is not excluding people because they are\n\ngay and lesbian.  It is excluding them solely\n\nbecause of the message that they want to send.\n\nAnd so the Court said applying the public\n\naccommodations law to them is not incidental,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n116\n\nOfficial\n\nit\u0027s not serving the content-neutral regulation\n\nof conduct because they\u0027re not discriminating on\n\nthe basis of status.\n\nInstead, the law in Hurley, the Court\n\nsaid, was equivalent to a law saying that the\n\nparade had to include any message that any\n\nprotected group wanted to offer. That is not an\n\nincidental burden on speech. That is a direct\n\nburden on speech.\n\nAnd the reason why we view this case\n\nas being like FAIR and not like Hurley is\n\nbecause Colorado is not asking Ms. Smith to say\n\nmessages or to speak messages that she would not","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"107","file_name":"303 Creative LLC v.

And\n\nthen you say those hypotheticals, unlike this\n\ncase, involve direct burdens on speech because\n\nthey contemplate speakers being forced to create\n\nand convey ideological messages they would not\n\ncreate for anyone.\n\nAnd I think the other side would say\n\nthat\u0027s exactly this case too to take that third\n\ncategory.  These are writers, in essence, being\n\nasked to write speeches that violate their most\n\ndeeply held convictions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"134","file_name":"303 Creative LLC v.

But, in FAIR itself,\n\nFAIR was about a duty to give access to empty\n\nrooms. The logistical e-mails that were to send\n\ndirections to how go to those rooms was a duty\n\nthat was required to facilitate legal conduct.\n\nThis case is speech that\u0027s only\n\nincidental to speech.
