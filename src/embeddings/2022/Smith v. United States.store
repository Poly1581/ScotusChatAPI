So the\n\nCoke treatise, Arundel\u0027s Case, all of those\n\nthings are totally consistent with our rule,\n\nwhich is the rule you were just describing\n\nearlier.

Is that\n\nsupposed to respond to the possibility of bad\n\nfaith? What -- what\u0027s appropriate?  What are\n\nextraordinary circumstances?\n\nMR. JOSHI: Yeah, I -- I think that\u0027s\n\nright. The question presented in this case is\n\nwhether the Constitution compels a forbidding of\n\nretrial.  Our answer is no.  But we don\u0027t think\n\nthe Constitution forbids that either.  Congress,\n\nfor example, could pass a statute and say the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\ngovernment gets one shot and that\u0027s it. That\n\nwould be perfectly constitutional.\n\nAnd we think that if there is actually\n\nan allegation of bad faith conduct on the part\n\nof the government, like any litigant engaging in\n\nbad faith conduct, courts have inherent powers\n\nto discipline the litigants, and if a court\n\nthinks that the government is walking in and\n\nserially retrying someone just for the purpose\n\nof harassing them in bad faith, it can issue a\n\npreclusive order like that.\n\nAnd we think that there\u0027s nothing in\n\nthe Constitution that forbids it.  There may be\n\nsome other statutory law or something, but\n\nnothing in the Constitution forbids it, and\n\nthat\u0027s what we were trying to say.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"54","file_name":"Smith v.

It\u0027s the rule that was\n\nannounced in Ball.  But it\u0027s strange that\n\nPetitioner relies on Ball, because Ball actually\n\ninvolved three defendants.  One was acquitted\n\ninitially.  The other two were convicted.  It\n\ncomes up to this Court in 1891, when appeal is\n\nallowed finally, and this Court says venue was\n\nbad. It wasn\u0027t adequately alleged.  Reverses\n\nthe convictions.\n\nIt goes back down.  Venue is now\n\nadequately alleged, proved to be in the same\n\nvenue, so not quite the issue here.
