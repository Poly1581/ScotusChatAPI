SNYDER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. SNYDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nOn two prior occasions when the Quiet\n\nTitle Act\u0027s 12-year time bar was squarely at\n\nissue, this Court held that the time bar imposed\n\na jurisdictional limit on the Court\u0027s power to\n\nadjudicate the merits of property claims against\n\nthe United States.\n\nThose decisions were clearly correct\n\nunder then-governing law, and, indeed, this\n\nCourt later cited them as controlling authority\n\nfor the settled principle that conditions on a\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity should be treated\n\nas jurisdictional.\n\nPetitioners now ask this Court to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n29\n\nOfficial\n\ndisregard its jurisdictional holdings in Block\n\nand Mottaz, arguing that this Court\u0027s\n\nintervening decisions have made it harder to\n\nshow that a restriction is jurisdictional and\n\nthat under the new test the time bar here should\n\nbe treated as just a claim-processing rule.\n\nFor three reasons, the Court should\n\nreject that invitation. First, Block and Mottaz\n\nreflected this Court\u0027s considered and binding\n\njudgment that the time bar was jurisdictional\n\nand therefore merits stare decisis respect.  In\n\nboth cases, the Court cited earlier decisions","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"25","file_name":"Wilkins v.

cases, the Court cited earlier decisions\n\nthat had recognized the strictly jurisdictional\n\nnature of comparable limits, and in both cases,\n\nthe jurisdictional determination had concrete\n\nsignificance for the litigation before the\n\nCourt. They were not mere drive-by\n\njurisdictional rulings.\n\nSecond, when Congress amended the\n\nQuiet Title Act in 1986, it ratified the\n\njurisdictional determinations of not only this\n\nCourt but also of the courts of appeals, which\n\nhad uniformly agreed that the time bar was\n\nstrictly jurisdictional.\n\nThird and finally, revisiting the time\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\nbar\u0027s jurisdictional status would cause\n\nunnecessary disruption.

SNYDER: So, because,\n\nrespectfully, this Court has looked to those\n\npolicy arguments in explaining why it\u0027s\n\nparticularly reluctant to treat provisions as\n\njurisdictional.  And so I think it\u0027s relevant\n\nhere that those policy arguments just apply with\n\nless force or cut in a different direction in\n\nthe Quiet Title Act context.\n\nThere are two things in particular\n\nthat I\u0027d point to.  The first is that in\n\nArbaugh, one of the reasons that this Court gave\n\nfor preferring non-jurisdictional to\n\njurisdictional readings was that that line can\n\naffect the decisionmaker that decides any\n\ndisputes of fact.\n\nBut, in the Quiet Title Act, whether\n\nthis is resolved at the 12(b)(1) stage or after\n\ntrial, it\u0027s going to be resolved by the exact\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\nsame decisionmaker.\n\nJustice Sotomayor, you were asking\n\nabout what difference this will make in the\n\ncase.
