 Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nOver 50 years ago, in Bruton versus\n\nUnited States, this Court held that the\n\nadmission of a nontestifying defendant\u0027s\n\nconfession that accuses another defendant in a\n\njoint trial violates the Confrontation Clause,\n\neven in the face of a limiting instruction, in\n\nlight of the uniquely prejudicial effect that\n\nsuch a confession has on the jury.\n\nThis Court has made clear that the\n\nBruton rule applies to a confession that has\n\nbeen redacted to avoid naming another defendant\n\nwhere the jury is likely to infer that the\n\nconfession implicated that defendant.\n\nThe question presented today is\n\nwhether the manner in which the redaction is\n\nHeritage

Petitioner\u0027s\n\nname, but, having done that, the prosecution\n\nused the confession functionally to identify\n\nPetitioner.\n\nThe prosecution\u0027s questioning of the\n\nagent who took the confession left little doubt\n\nthat the confessing defendant had named \"the\n\nother person.\"  Petitioner was the only\n\ndefendant who plausibly could have been \"the\n\nother person.\"\n\nThe

And it\u0027s not just in the context of\n\nBruton.\n\nIn Jackson versus Denno, this Court\n\ninvalidated a Texas rule under which the jury\n\nwas to consider the voluntariness of a\n\nconfession, and the Court concluded that the\n\nproblem with that rule is that a jury, once it\n\nconcluded that a confession was involuntary,\n\nwould not be able to put it out of its mind.\n\nAnd I would actually point all the way\n\nback to this Court\u0027s decision in Shepherd versus\n\nUnited States in which Justice Cardozo, writing\n\nfor the Court, said the same thing with regard\n\nto an instruction concerning a dying\n\ndeclaration, that that could not be admitted\n\neven with a limiting instruction solely as\n\nevidence of the dying declarant\u0027s state of mind.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Shanmugam, if we\n\nwere --\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  But that\u0027s\n\nprejudicial, right, but -- sorry, I\u0027ll just\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"20","file_name":"Samia v.

 This was a\n\ncircumstance --\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Before you go on, I\n\nthink that\u0027s really important and I just want to\n\nunderstand.  So you\u0027re saying we\u0027re in the world\n\nof exception because, at the beginning, with\n\nrespect to the Confrontation Clause, to the\n\nextent that a confession is being introduced,\n\nthe defendant has a constitutional right to\n\ncross-examine the person who made that\n\nconfession?\n\nMR. SHANMUGAM:  Mm-hmm.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  But, because the\n\ngovernment made the choice to try these people\n\ntogether, there isn\u0027t that right.  And the\n\nquestion is, can we use the confession under\n\nthose circumstances?  And this is an exception\n\nthat would allow for the use.\n\nMR.

The first is that\n\nif one were minded to think about this as an\n\noriginalist matter, I really do think that the\n\ngovernment is approaching this as essentially an\n\nexception to the underlying Confrontation Clause\n\nright, and it is therefore incumbent on the\n\ngovernment to point to some original evidence.\n\nThe limiting instructions were viewed as\n\nsufficient to cure what would otherwise be a\n\nConfrontation Clause problem.  And, obviously,\n\nthere is no such evidence.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"24","file_name":"Samia v.

One final\n\nquestion about Gray. Isn\u0027t it true that in Gray\n\nthe Court said \"the inferences at issue here\n\ninvolve statements that\" -- and I\u0027m putting in\n\nan ellipsis here -- \"a jury ordinarily could\n\nmake immediately even were the confession the\n\nvery first item introduced at trial\"?\n\nThat seems to be a pretty clear rule,\n\nand it wouldn\u0027t help you here.

brief from a lot of states, a real\n\ncross-section of states, saying this would be a\n\nhuge problem.  I mean, maybe in the federal\n\ncourts, some of the federal courts of appeals\n\nhave adjusted. But they\u0027re saying in the states\n\nthat this could be a real problem.\n\nMR.

You would expect them or the\n\nUnited States to point to some difficulty in\n\nadministration.\n\nBut, quite to the contrary, courts\n\nhave applied this approach, they have applied it\n\noverwhelmingly in the in limine context when\n\nthey are considering the issue of suppression\n\ntogether with the issue of severance.

is not a\n\nterribly clear test. I think that what the\n\ngovernment itself acknowledges is that there\n\nwill be circumstances in which certain types of\n\nidentification, the use of nicknames, the use of\n\n\"close\" physical descriptions, will be\n\nsufficient to come within the scope of the rule.\n\nAnd, further, that in making the\n\ndetermination about whether that\u0027s enough for an\n\nidentification, you have to look to evidence,\n\nbecause there can be cases where there are\n\ndisputes about whether a defendant goes under a\n\nparticular nickname.\n\nSo I think that there are going to be\n\nadministrability concerns regardless.  Our\n\nsubmission is simply that there\u0027s no evidence\n\nthat our predominant approach has caused those\n\nconcerns.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nJackson?\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  So can I just have\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"47","file_name":"Samia v.

The Bruton exception to that\n\nprinciple simply holds that when it comes to a\n\ndiscrete category of statements, testimonial\n\nconfessions by co-defendants that expressly name\n\nanother defendant or are otherwise facially\n\nincriminating, we will no longer presume that\n\nthe jury can obey that instruction.\n\nBut this Court has taken care to treat\n\nthe Bruton exception as narrow and it has\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\nrepeatedly declined to extend it.\n\nThe Court should decline Petitioner\u0027s\n\nrequest here too.  First, confessions that\n\nreplace a defendant\u0027s name with a\n\nnatural-sounding noun or pronoun do not give\n\nrise to an overwhelming probability of juror\n\ndisobedience.\n\nAs this Court already reasoned in\n\nRichardson and reaffirmed in Gray, confessions\n\nthat incriminate another defendant only\n\ninferentially through potential connections to\n\nother evidence at trial do not qualify for\n\nBruton\u0027s prophylactic treatment.\n\nIn fact, as has been discussed this\n\nmorning already, this Court already approved of\n\na confession like this in Gray, one that was\n\nmodified there to refer to \"other guys\" who also\n\ncommitted the crime alongside the confessing\n\ndefendant.\n\nAnd Petitioner\u0027s surrounding context\n\ntest gives rise to the same practical problems\n\nthat this Court already identified in Richardson","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"51","file_name":"Samia v.

I think keeping Bruton narrow is\n\nconsistent with this Court\u0027s cases.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Isn\u0027t it true that\n\nthere are two analytically pure, conceptually\n\npure ways in which the fundamental issue here\n\ncould be addressed?  One -- but they both have\n\ntheir practical problems.\n\nOne is to say, as was previously the\n\nrule, that if the jury is instructed to consider\n\nit only against the person who confessed, that\n\ncures the problem.\n\nThe other is to recognize that this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n89\n\nOfficial\n\nissue is never going to arise unless there is\n\nsome risk or some reason to fear that the\n\nconfession is going to be held by the jury\n\nagainst the nontestifying co-defendant because\n\nthey just can\u0027t put that out of their minds.\n\nIt\u0027s not realistic to expect them to do that.\n\nSo those are -- if you -- you take\n\neither of those positions, you\u0027ve got a --\n\nyou\u0027ve got a clear rationale.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"80","file_name":"Samia v.
