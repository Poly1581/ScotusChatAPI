The reasons for that\n\nclear statement rule -- notice and equality\n\namong independent nations -- apply with greater\n\nforce here.  It is outlandish to think that\n\nSection 3231 authorizes federal courts to\n\nconvict Spain.\n\nThe U.S. does not dispute that\n\ncriminal trials against sovereigns were\n\nunthinkable in 1789, would violate\n\ninternational law today, are unprecedented\n\nanywhere, and would risk retaliation.
