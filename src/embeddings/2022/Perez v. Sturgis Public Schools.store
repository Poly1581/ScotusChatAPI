MARTINEZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nFor 12 years, Sturgis neglected\n\nMiguel, denied him an education, and lied to\n\nhis parents about the progress he was allegedly\n\nmaking in school.  This shameful conduct\n\npermanently stunted Miguel\u0027s ability to\n\ncommunicate with the outside world.  It also\n\nviolated two federal statutes, the IDEA and the\n\nADA, giving different remedies to victims of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\nMiguel responded by doing everything\n\nthe IDEA wants him to do. He filed an IDEA\n\nagency claim.  He followed the IDEA settlement\n\nprocedures.

Exhaustion isn\u0027t\n\nrequired in cases like this one seeking only\n\nmoney damages, a remedy the IDEA does not\n\nauthorize.\n\nSecond, Miguel\u0027s settlement fully\n\nexhausted the IDEA procedures.

So I think the\n\nlegislative history in two places is helpful\n\nboth in illustrating Congress\u0027s intentions and\n\nalso in confirming the original public meaning\n\nof -- of the statutory text that was enacted.\n\nFor purposes of our first argument, I\n\nthink the most important thing is the House\n\nreport at page 7, and what it says there is\n\nthat -- it\u0027s interpreting the language that was\n\n-- ultimately became law, and it said that\n\nexhaustion is not required when -- and I\u0027m\n\nquoting -- \"the hearing officer lacks the\n\nHeritage Reporting

relief sought.\"\n\nSo that just confirms our textual\n\nargument that if you\u0027re seeking relief that\u0027s\n\nnot available, you -- you don\u0027t have to exhaust\n\nbecause there the hearing officer wouldn\u0027t\n\ngrant relief.\n\nI think the legislative history is\n\nalso helpful on our argument that -- that the\n\nbest way to think about a settlement is that it\n\n-- it -- it constitutes exhaustion or supports\n\na futility argument.  And there I would point\n\nyou to the Senate report, which says that --\n\nand, here, I\u0027m quoting again -- \"exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies would be excused where\n\nthey would not be required to be exhausted\n\nunder the [IDEA], such as when resort to those\n\nproceedings would be futile.\"","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"26","file_name":"Perez v.

Congress\n\ncarefully crafted those procedures, and it\n\nwanted parents and school districts to go\n\nthrough them because of the primacy of a FAPE.\n\nCongress\u0027s choice helps answer both\n\nquestions presented, plus the third that\n\nMr. Perez wants to add.\n\nOn the first question, Congress\u0027s\n\nchoice shows that the word \"relief\" in 1415(l)\n\nmeans redress for harm, not a specific remedy.\n\nWhen a plaintiff complains of a FAPE denial,\n\nrelief is available under the IDEA, and the\n\nplaintiff must exhaust.  Any other test would\n\nallow plaintiffs to circumvent the exhaustion\n\nrequirement Congress carefully crafted by using\n\nthe magic word \"damages\" and going straight to\n\ncourt.\n\nOn the futility question, Congress\u0027s\n\nchoice explains the unusually specific words\n\nthat Congress wrote.  A plaintiff must exhaust\n\nto the same extent as would be required had the\n\naction been brought under the IDEA.

That\u0027s not relief that\u0027s\n\navailable under the IDEA.\n\nMR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Kagan, I think\n\nthat \"redress\" can also bear a different\n\nmeaning, which is not just the specific remedy\n\nthat you\u0027re asking for but redress for a harm.\n\nIt\u0027s the -- it\u0027s the kind of situation where\n\nyou may not get what you ask for, but you get\n\nwhat you need.\n\nAnd if you bring a FAPE denial claim\n\nseeking damages to an IDEA hearing officer,\n\nyou\u0027re not going to get damages because the\n\nIDEA doesn\u0027t give you that, but you will get a\n\nFAPE, and that is redress for the harm of\n\ndenial of a FAPE.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"54","file_name":"Perez v.

In other\n\nwords, if this FAPE-related ADA claim or FAPE\n\ndenial ADA claim had been brought as an IDEA\n\nclaim, would there be a futility exception to\n\nthat IDEA claim?  And the answer to that\n\nquestion is no.\n\nThe relevant principle of exhaustion,\n\nexhaustion is excused as futile when the agency\n\ncan\u0027t grant you some relief that a court could\n\ngrant you. That\u0027s the circumstance in which it\n\nmakes sense to say we\u0027re going to excuse\n\nexhaustion, we\u0027re going to allow you to skip\n\nover the first-level decisionmaker and go\n\nstraight to a second-level decisionmaker who\n\ncan help you.\n\nThat principle doesn\u0027t apply either as\n\nto a damages request or in the settlement\n\ncontext for an IDEA claim. A damages request\n\ncan\u0027t excuse exhaustion as futile because\n\nneither a hearing officer nor a court can award\n\ndamages under the IDEA.  The problem is that\n\nthe IDEA doesn\u0027t authorize damages in the first\n\nplace, not that the hearing officer is somehow\n\nuniquely powerless to grant them.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"63","file_name":"Perez v.

Their answer is that if Sturgis had\n\nrefused to cave in, had refused to give Miguel\n\nmore than it had already negotiated, Miguel\n\nwould have had to reject the settlement, turn\n\ndown the immediate FAPE relief, and roll the\n\ndice in an IDEA proceeding that might risk not\n\nonly his recovery but also his attorneys\u0027 fees.\n\nNo way.  That\u0027s not what this statute is about.\n\nAnd I think what that answer shows is\n\nwhat Sturgis is really seeking here is a rule\n\nthat\u0027s going to nullify ADA rights and it\u0027s\n\ngoing to resurrect the regime of Smith versus\n\nRobinson that Congress expressly rejected.\n\nA couple of additional points.\n\nWith respect to the text, their\n\ninterpretation of \"relief\" means that if I go\n\nand I file an ADA claim and a complaint and it","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"87","file_name":"Perez v.
