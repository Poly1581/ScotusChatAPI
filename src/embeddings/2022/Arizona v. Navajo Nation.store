 Can I go back to\n\nJustice Kagan\u0027s question?  Because,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that the treaty doesn\u0027t\n\nhave the express terminology that you were just\n\nexploring with Justice Barrett, you\u0027ve also said\n\nhere and in previous litigation and your\n\npractices indicate that the Winters right that\n\nbelongs to the Navajo is being held in trust by\n\nthe United States.\n\nSo, to the extent that Winters looks\n\nat the treaty and treaties like this and says\n\nthere is a water right, the United States\n\nconcedes that it has a trust relationship with\n\nrespect to those water rights.\n\nSo what I don\u0027t understand is why we\n\ndon\u0027t have a simple breach of fiduciary duty\n\nkind of scenario where anyone who has a trustee\n\ncontrolling their interests can come to court\n\nand say the trustee is not doing what it\u0027s\n\nsupposed to do in terms of those interests.

The\n\nfederal government made federal reserved right\n\nclaims to 20 -- for 25 reservations. Five of\n\nthose claims went to the Lower Colorado River.\n\nTwenty of those claims were to the Little\n\nColorado River and other tributaries of the\n\nLower Colorado River system.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"49","file_name":"Arizona v.

DVORETZKY:  Justice Kagan, I think\n\nthe government\u0027s conduct both in Arizona versus\n\nCalifornia and in other cases belies the notion\n\nthat the treaty just gives the -- gives the\n\ntribe a stick and a bundle to do with as it\n\nwishes.\n\nThe government itself, its own\n\nconduct, shows that it believes it has\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n77\n\nOfficial\n\naffirmative duties.  In Arizona versus\n\nCalifornia, the United States said that it spoke\n\nfor the Nation.\n\nMore recently, in a January 20 -- 2022\n\nintervention motion in New Mexico litigation,\n\nthe government said again, \"The United States is\n\nthe legal owner of all water rights recognized\n\nfor the Navajo Nation, holding these rights in\n\ntrust for the Navajo Nation.\"\n\nSo the United States is controlling\n\nthese Winters rights and, in certain instances,\n\nlike Arizona versus California, blocking the\n\nNation from asserting those rights for itself.\n\nSo the United -- this is not a\n\nsituation where the United States simply gave\n\nthe Nation a stick and said, here you go, use","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"68","file_name":"Arizona v.

Just a few quick points.\n\nFirst, about the Winters decision, we\n\nread that decision as having basically two\n\nparts. One part of it is about the scope of the\n\nreservation that\u0027s granted to the Indians.  That\n\nscope of reservation includes water.\n\nMy friend described it as access to\n\nwater. Justice Kagan, you asked, that seems\n\ndifferent from how we\u0027re describing it. It is,\n\nand we\u0027re correct for two reasons.\n\nLook at -- look at the nature of the\n\nright with respect to the land that\u0027s reserved\n\nunder -- under that reservation. There are no\n\nensure access to land, build roads, build\n\nbridges as to the land.  There\u0027s no such duty as\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n120\n\nOfficial\n\nwith respect to the minerals.  No such duties\n\nwith respect to the timber.  So, if you compare\n\nthe water to those other things that also come\n\nwith the same bundle of sticks, we\u0027re right\n\nabout what the right is being -- what -- what\n\nright is being conveyed.\n\nAlso, compare the Winters doctrine not\n\njust in the Indian context but to every other\n\ncontext it applies:  not just to Indian\n\nreservations but to national monuments, national\n\nparks, national refuge areas.\n\nIn all of those other instances, this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"109","file_name":"Arizona v.
