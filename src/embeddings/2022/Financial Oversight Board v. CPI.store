CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear argument\n\n4 today in Case 22-96, Financial Oversight and Management\n\n5 Board for Puerto Rico versus Centro de Periodismo\n\n6 Investigativo.\n\n7

It held that way before\n\n12 Puerto Rico\u0027s constitutional assembly in the 1950s, and,\n\n13 since then, it has said that Puerto Rico has a degree of\n\n14 sovereignty -- excuse me, autonomy comparable to a\n\n15 state.\n\n16 CPI\u0027s theory that Puerto Rico has immunity\n\n17 only in its own courts would mean that Puerto Rico or\n\n18 its governor or other officials could be sued under\n\n19 Puerto Rico\u0027s own law in federal court.

That immunity derives from the\n\n4 nature of Puerto Rico\u0027s government, and it extends to\n\n5 the sovereign\u0027s own court and to federal court. Just as\n\n6 with federal, state, and tribal immunity, any waiver or\n\n7 abrogation of Puerto Rico\u0027s sovereign immunity requires\n\n8 a clear statement.\n\n9 Section 106(a) of PROMESA does not include\n\n10 that statement.

You know, depending\n\n15 on what the basis for sovereign immunity is in this\n\n16 case, could it possibly lead to a different clear\n\n17 statement rule?\n\n18 MS.

I think it is just kind\n\n21 of this necessary corollary to the existence of\n\n22 self-government in the first instance. That\u0027s the way\n\n23 that the Court has described it. In -- in Bay Mills,\n\n24 for example, the Court said once, you know, when we have\n\n25 self-government that exists, we\u0027re -- we\u0027re particularly\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n26\n\nOfficial\n\n1 hesitant to conclude that Congress is acting to\n\n2 undermine that self-government.

There have been some courts -- there\u0027s a\n\n16 Ninth Circuit opinion, I believe, that holds that, with\n\n17 respect to the Northern Mariana Islands, there are\n\n18 provisions within the compact with Congress or the\n\n19 covenant with Congress in that case that -- that waive\n\n20 sovereign immunity in particular instances.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH M.\n\nHARRIS\n\n10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\n11 MS.\n\nHARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n12 please the Court:\n\n13 Congress did not need to surmount a clear\n\n14 statement rule to subject the Board to suit for\n\n15 violating Puerto Rico\u0027s constitution.\n\n16 This Court has required some historical or\n\n17 constitutional basis for clear statement rules.\n\n18 Puerto Rico is a territory, so the clear statement rule\n\n19 for abrogating state sovereign immunity is out.\n\n20 But, unlike for states and tribes, this\n\n21 Court has never imposed clear statement rules before\n\n22 Congress can curtail territorial autonomy, nor has this\n\n23 Court ever imposed clear statement rules for waivers or\n\n24 abrogations of territorial

that are clearly\n\n4 taking effect against the Board, how can you have that\n\n5 if there is not abrogation for constitutional\n\n6 violations? And I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to say\n\n7 that that happens without some sort of abrogation\n\n8 happening in PROMESA even under a clear statement rule.\n\n9 The other side has pointed to the Title 3\n\n10 bankruptcy proceedings, and that is simply incorrect.\n\n11 That cannot be the answer to how there is abrogation for\n\n12 constitutional violations for two reasons.\n\n13 First of all, if Congress wanted to refer to\n\n14 Title 3 as the basis for these orders against\n\n15 constitutional violations, it presumably would have done\n\n16 what it did in Section 2126(a), which is to actually\n\n17 refer expressly to the carve-out for Title 3, which has\n\n18 its own very reticulated judicial review scheme of its\n\n19 own.\n\n20 And second of all, there is no abrogation\n\n21 for the type of claims that the Board is pointing to\n\n22 here that would get you to an abrogation under Title 3\n\n23 for orders remedying constitutional violations.\n\n24 Let me explain why.

It would not help to DIG this case for the\n\n6 simple reason that there\u0027s a First Circuit ruling on the\n\n7 books right now which says that 2126 abrogates all kinds\n\n8 of actions, every possible action against the Board,\n\n9 both under federal law and under territorial law.\n\n10 That\u0027s an enormous decision.\n\n11 It\u0027s very counterintuitive to think Congress\n\n12 would have wanted that, that even situations where the\n\n13 Board or a -- or a governmental entity in Puerto Rico\n\n14 may have had immunity on its own if it were part of the\n\n15 territory, now when it\u0027s a suit against the Board in\n\n16 federal court, the Board has a target on its back.  Any\n\n17 single -- any type of action can be brought.\n\n18 That -- that simply doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\n19 That ruling would still be there unless the Court\n\n20 decides that that was incorrect because the\n\n21 interpretation of 2126(a) is not correct.\n\n22 I also have not heard from the other side\n\n23 really any defense of the actual reasons that the First\n\n24 Circuit gave here.
