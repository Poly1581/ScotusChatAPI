ARGUMENT OF CAMERON T. NORRIS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. NORRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nGrutter assumed that universities\n\ncould use race in a narrowly tailored way if\n\nthey just did it like Harvard.  But this Court\n\nnever had any evidence about Harvard.

Absolutely.\n\nSo, in terms\n\nof the original meaning of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, the best source on this I\u0027ve ever\n\nread is the United States\u0027 brief on reargument\n\nin Brown.  It painstakingly details the\n\nlegislative history and how the framers of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment saw it as a ban on all\n\nracial classifications.\n\nAlso, the -- everyone knows that the\n\nimpetus for the Fourteenth Amendment was to\n\nconstitutionalize the Civil Rights Act of 1866.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 is a series of bans\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n6\n\nOfficial\n\non racial discrimination.  It\u0027s a series of\n\ncolor-blind measures and requirements.\n\nAnd then the -- one of the earliest\n\ncases this Court had before it went off the\n\nrails in Plessy was a case called Strauder,\n\nwhere the Court immediately recognized that the\n\npurpose of this amendment was to eliminate\n\nracial classifications, no matter whether they\n\nbenefited whites or blacks, because racial\n\nclassifications themselves impose harms.\n\nThat\u0027s the affirmative evidence.  Now\n\nI know that the -- the -- the evidence -- the\n\npushback is the post-ratification history, but\n\nthe post-ratification of the history of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment is not the best evidence\n\nbecause we know there was massive resistance to\n\nthe original meaning of the text of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\nBut it also doesn\u0027t prove anything.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"4","file_name":"Students for Fair Admissions v.

GORSUCH:  Okay.\n\nAnd on -- but\n\n-- but what do we -- what is a court, a lower\n\ncourt, all right, faced with, you know,\n\ndiversity and very hard standards to apply,\n\nsupposed to do when a university\u0027s admissions\n\ndata with respect to race looks more or less\n\nidentical every single year?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think, at that\n\npoint, the district court needs to probe whether\n\nimpermissible racial balancing is happening.\n\nThe Court has made clear that that is not\n\nappropriate, that the relevant compelling\n\ninterest here is not in trying to achieve a\n\nprecise percentage of particular racial or\n\nethnic groups in the class year over year.  And\n\nso, if that kind of evidence existed, then I\n\nthink it would be incumbent on the university to\n\n-- to establish that it is not actually engaging\n\nin racial balancing.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think, in this\n\ncase, wasn\u0027t it clear there were variations\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n110\n\nOfficial\n\namong the groups?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, that\u0027s exactly\n\nright, Justice Sotomayor. And what the district\n\ncourt said with respect to the Harvard facts is\n\nthat there were greater fluctuations with\n\nrespect to the number of students in each group\n\nwho were admitted year over year than there were\n\nfluctuations in the applicant pool of\n\nindividuals of those particular races.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"97","file_name":"Students for Fair Admissions v.

and horrible history of racial\n\ndiscrimination, and, surely, that functions here\n\nto prevent racial classifications or to prevent\n\nrace consciousness of the kind that Harvard and\n\nUNC are using.\n\nAnd I just thought I\u0027d give you an\n\nopportunity to discuss what you think of that\n\nargument.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that\n\nargument is wrong in just about every respect.\n\nThere is a world of difference between the\n\nsituation this Court confronted in Brown, the\n\nseparate but equal doctrine that was designed to\n\nexclude African Americans based on

the U.S. Government below said\n\nthis manifest steadiness speaks for itself.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, let me just\n\nsay that the district court made a factual\n\nfinding of no racial balancing.  But, if you\n\nthink the district court was wrong about that\n\nand this is clearly erroneous, then that is\n\nclearly impermissible and -- and the Court\n\nshould send it back.\n\nThat would provide a basis to reverse\n\non clear error, and we are not here to suggest\n\nthat racial balancing is okay under this Court\u0027s\n\nprecedents.  Grutter doesn\u0027t countenance it and\n\nthe Court could make that clear.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nKavanaugh?\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I appreciate your\n\nstatement about Brown.

The Court made clear in the four\n\nparagraphs that we\u0027ve been discussing that the\n\nCourt expected that universities would no longer\n\nbe able to justify race-conscious admissions\n\npolicies over time, but that was because the\n\nCourt expected that, due to the rate of change\n\nin society, they would be able to achieve the\n\nbenefits of student body diversity without\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n117\n\nOfficial\n\ntaking race into account.\n\nAnd so I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s tenable\n\nto read the majority opinion in that case as\n\nhaving determined that there was a -- a 25-year\n\nclock that would be inflexible.

NORRIS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nNORRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  Just a few points.\n\nFirst, I think what\u0027s lost in the\n\nUnited States\u0027 argument and Harvard\u0027s argument\n\nand in Grutter itself is that racial\n\nclassifications themselves have harms.  They\n\nstigmatize their intended beneficiaries, they\n\nincrease racial consciousness, which delays the\n\nday in which we can move to true racial\n\nneutrality, and they cause resentment by\n\ntreating people differently based on something\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n118\n\nOfficial\n\nthey can\u0027t change that\u0027s cosmetic and that\u0027s\n\nirrelevant to their ability to get educational\n\nopportunities.\n\nThe Court said that in Adarand.  It\n\nsaid it in Shaw.  It said it in Croson.  Harvard\n\ndoesn\u0027t challenge any of those precedents.\n\nSecondly, race-neutral alternatives.\n\nThere were a few pleas for a remand that I heard\n\nfrom my friends, but it\u0027s hard to take those\n\nseriously when Harvard thumbed its nose at\n\nGrutter for 14 years to not consider\n\nrace-neutral alternatives one time until three\n\nyears after we filed a lawsuit against it.\n\nI understand Mr. Waxman to say he\u0027ll\n\nno longer defend his legacy preferences, but now\n\nwhat -- what -- what\u0027s at stake in terms of\n\nrace-neutral alternatives are a decline, a","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"104","file_name":"Students for Fair Admissions v.
