LAMKEN:  Yes.  And I think the\n\nfirst and most critical thing about the roadmap\n\nis these two new antibodies that didn\u0027t exist\n\nbefore our invention, one that sits a little bit\n\non the left of that -- of the PCSK9, one on the\n\n-- little bit on -- on the right of PCSK9.\n\nAnd what those do is they allow you to\n\nfind everything that will bind to the sweet spot\n\nin PCSK9 because they cover it completely.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"36","file_name":"Amgen Inc. v.

If you claim a lot and\n\nenable a little, the public is short-changed and\n\nthe patent is invalid.  The Federal Circuit has\n\nlong enforced that basic principle by requiring\n\nthe patentee to enable the full scope of the\n\npatent without undue experimentation.\n\nAmgen does not take issue with that\n\ntest, with the Wands factors, I think, or the\n\nvast bulk of the Federal Circuit\u0027s enablement\n\nprecedent.  But the full scope test, which they\n\ndon\u0027t take issue with at least as I understand\n\nit, dooms their claims here, as well illustrated\n\nby the chart on page 15 of the red brief.\n\nAmgen claims antibodies that -- that\n\nbind on 16 residues in the epitope, but their --\n\ntheir specification does not enable skilled\n\nartisans to reliably produce them when they bind\n\nat 10 or more.
