of the case.\n\nAnd, as I understand it, the\n\nmemorandum really talks about two things.  It\n\ntalks about forbearance and it talks about sort\n\nof economics/COVID conditions, forbearance as a\n\nkind of separate thing that people who have been\n\ngranted forbearance for long periods of time are\n\nmore likely to go into default or become\n\ndelinquent in their payments.\n\nAnd I guess I wonder, is that about\n\nCOVID, or is that just about something that\n\nhappens when you excuse loan payments for a long\n\nperiod of time and how it is that that gets to\n\nbe converted into an emergency COVID rationale?\n\nAnd then, on the economic\n\nconsiderations, and I think it was Justice\n\nBarrett who talked about this a little, it\n\nseems, you know, a real mixture of COVID and\n\nnon-COVID-related things.\n\nAnd, of course, this is how the\n\neconomy works, that COVID interacts with other\n\nfeatures of the economy to produce certain\n\neconomic conditions, but, again, I\u0027m wondering\n\nwhether, you know, there was more of an\n\nobligation on the part of the Secretary to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\nisolate how COVID was affecting these borrowers?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"17","file_name":"Dept. of Education v.

this is a pandemic-related program.\n\nIt\n\nspecifically focuses on the national emergency\n\ncircumstances that have had profound financial\n\neffects on student-loan borrowers.
