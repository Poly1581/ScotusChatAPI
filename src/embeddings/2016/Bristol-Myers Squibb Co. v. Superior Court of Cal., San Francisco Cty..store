There are 575 out-of-State plaintiffs\n\nfrom 33 States. So the California court\u0027s going to have\n\nto first figure that out.\n\nSecond, it\u0027s then going to have to apply\n\nCalifornia procedure to all of these cases, which is\n\nmarkedly different than the procedure in the places in\n\nwhich Bristol-Myers sold the drugs as to which caused\n\nthe underlying injury.\n\nSo, for example, California has different\n\nrules about summary judgment. It\u0027s really hard to get\n\nsummary judgment, very easy to go to trial. It\u0027s\n\nalso -- they don\u0027t have a Daubert rule, so they have\n\nvery lenient permissive testimony with respect to\n\nexperts. That isn\u0027t something Bristol-Myers bought into\n\nwhen they sold, for example, a drug in Ohio to an Ohio\n\nplaintiff.\n\nThen you get to the trial. And this is, I\n\nthink, the most important part, because their reply --\n\nbecause their brief points it out as, oh, this is\n\nefficient and it\u0027s coordinating all of these actions.\n\nTake a look at Joint Appendix page 74, which is their\n\njury trial demand.

I mean,\n\nindividual -- a lot of individual California claims can\n\nbe joined, and then we can have an argument about what\n\nshould probably be joined and what can go off\n\nindividually. But -- but that\u0027s a different question\n\nthan the question in this case, which is, why is it\n\nunfair to glom on Texas claims and New York claims to\n\nthe California claims, once we already have a mass\n\naction which will have multiple injury trials?\n\nMR. KATYAL: So -- and the reasons are both\n\nprocedure and substance. So procedurally, you\u0027ll be\n\nplaying by different rules than what the defendant has\n\naccepted, and this Court\u0027s always said, one of the goals\n\nin specific jurisdiction litigation is to make sure and\n\ntee up to businesses, particularly small businesses,\n\nlike the Plack brief points out, look, if you are enter\n\na jurisdiction, here\u0027s what you\u0027re going to face. And\n\nBristol-Myers doesn\u0027t disagree. When they sold the\n\n180 million pills in California, they opened themselves\n\nup to the jurisdiction for those pills.

GOLDSTEIN: The backdoor. Yes, exactly.\n\nSo important things about why that can\u0027t be right. I do\n\nthink the driving concern in cases like Daimler and\n\nGoodyear about general jurisdiction is that you can hail\n\nsomebody into the forum and sue them about absolutely\n\nanything. And this is a world of difference because\n\nthis is being -- this suit is being brought on behalf --\n\non the basis of their conduct in the State with respect\n\nto this drug.\n\nAnd the second is, I do think the Court\n\nrecognized in Daimler quite explicitly that the\n\nretrenchment of general jurisdiction, how these cases\n\nhad always been brought -- and so there\u0027s no argument\n\nthat we\u0027ve -- we\u0027re disrupting the legal system -- the\n\nretrenchment of general jurisdiction was going to induce\n\nan examination of the Court\u0027s specific personal\n\njurisdiction to fill in the gaps.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- this is answer\n\nthis in a sense -- all right. This is -- because you\n\njust started to with Justice Ginsburg, no general\n\njurisdiction. Why am I here, says defendant.

So if it\u0027s -- what\n\nwould happen, Justice Breyer is saying, is you would\n\nhave a lawsuit, a class action that would be removed to\n\nFederal court, specific jurisdiction would exist under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 4K there. Then it would\n\nbe transferred for pretrial purposes to the MDL forum\n\nand then returned for purposes of trial.\n\nAnd so his point, I think, would be that it\n\nwould be okay in Federal court in the -- in the MDL\n\nsystem.\n\nMy answer back is that there are still lots\n\nof other objections about it being inconvenient, it\u0027s\n\nnot where he\u0027s at, there\u0027d be choice of law issues that\n\ndoes really -- a lot of the fairness concerns that\n\nMr. Katyal is talking about do arise in MDL, do arise in\n\nthe New Jersey example he gives of specific personal\n\njurisdiction.

KATYAL: So, Justice Sotomayor, my\n\ntheory is exactly what this Court said in Rush, which is\n\nwhy his argument in McKesson doesn\u0027t work.\n\nIt\u0027s, quote, plainly unconstitutional to\n\nexert jurisdiction over one defendant based on the\n\nactivities of another. The requirements of\n\nInternational Shoe must be met as to each.\n\nSo McKesson doesn\u0027t answer -- help him, nor\n\ndoes it move the ball. You still have to show that the\n\nunderlying conduct by the defendant did something.\n\nSo, here when he talks about $918 million,\n\nwe have no problem saying we\u0027re liable for the sales\n\nover there. The question was -- what Justice Breyer was\n\nasking is, what about Mr. Smith? You know, I\u0027m selling\n\nto Mr. Smith in Ohio, and, yes, I\u0027m also separately\n\nselling $918 million in California, but you can\u0027t add\n\nthose two things up together and confer personal\n\njurisdiction. This Court has never done that, which is\n\nwhy his rule is a novel one.\n\nSo as Justice Kennedy said, I think that one\n\nof the goals here, here in this jurisprudence, has been\n\nto stay State A has an interest in combining State B\u0027s\n\nadjudicatory authority.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"63","file_name":"Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.
