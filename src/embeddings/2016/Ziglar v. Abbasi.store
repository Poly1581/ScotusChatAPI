Abbasi.\n\n5 Mr. Gershengorn.\n\n6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN\n\n7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n8 IN NOS. 15-1358 AND 15-1359\n\n9 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\n10 may it please the Court:\n\n11 This case marks the return of Iqbal as\n\n12 Plaintiffs seek to hold essentially the same defendants\n\n13 liable for the same actions arising in the same\n\n14 extraordinary circumstances in the wake of the\n\n15 September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n16 All of the judges below concluded that\n\n17 Plaintiffs\u0027 core theory is squarely foreclosed by Iqbal.\n\n18 But the Second Circuit majority then formulated its own\n\n19 list merger theory of liability, premising liability on\n\n20 the alleged decision of Attorney General Ashcroft to\n\n21 merge the New York list of detainees, which had not been\n\n22 fully vetted, with the INS list, thereby continuing the\n\n23 hold-until-cleared policy for detainees on both lists.\n\n24 Bivens\u0027 liability does not attach here for\n\n25 at least three reasons.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"2","file_name":"Ziglar v.

Subject to Final Review\n\n1 First, the Bivens remedy should not be\n\n2 extended to national security and immigration policy\n\n3 decisions by senior officials in the wake of the\n\n4 September 11 attacks. If the damages remedy is to be\n\n5 imposed, it\u0027s for Congress, not this Court, to do so.\n\n6 Second, the list merger theory suffers from\n\n7 the same pleading deficiencies that this Court\n\n8 identified in Iqbal itself. Among other things, there\n\n9 is an obvious alternative and noninvidious explanation\n\n10 of the list merger decision. Given the uncertainty\n\n11 about the status of detainees on the New York list, the\n\n12 list merger was undertaken to avoid the inadvertent or\n\n13 premature release of a dangerous terrorist.\n\n14 And third, the defendants here violated no\n\n15 clearly established right. It would not have been clear\n\n16 to every reasonable defendant that merging the lists in\n\n17 the wake of the 9/11 attacks would be unconstitutional\n\n18 rather than risking premature release of a detainee on\n\n19 the New York list.\n\n20 I think the easiest way for this Court to\n\n21 resolve this case is through the Iqbal pleading theory.\n\n22 But given this Court\u0027s admonition that the existence of\n\n23 the Bivens remedy is an antecedent question that the\n\n24 Court should address first, let me start there.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"3","file_name":"Ziglar v.

In general, the government\u0027s response\n\n11 to those petitions being filed was to move the detainee\n\n12 up to the front of the list, to clear him so that he\n\n13 could be removed from the country and from the\n\n14 restrictive conditions of confinement before a court\n\n15 could have the opportunity to rule on the legality of\n\n16 the detention.
