KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 The United States Constitution does not\n\n12 confer U.S. citizenship on anyone born outside the\n\n13 United States. Rather, pursuant to its plenary\n\n14 authority under Article I of the Constitution, it is for\n\n15 Congress to determine which categories of such persons\n\n16 should be granted U.S. citizenship by statute.\n\n17 In doing so, Congress has always required\n\n18 that the persons involved have a demonstrated and\n\n19 sufficient connection to the United States, either in\n\n20 themselves or through their parents, to warrant the\n\n21 conferral of citizenship, because citizenship carries\n\n22 with it attendant duties and rights on the part of the\n\n23 individual, and important duties of protection and\n\n24 obligation on the part of the United States government.\n\n25 This case concerns the framework under the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Lynch v.

When the father legitimates, what -- what the\n\n18 statute does is treat the couple as if they were\n\n19 married.
