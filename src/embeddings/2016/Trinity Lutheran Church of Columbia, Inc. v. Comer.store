CORTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nThe State of Missouri has excluded The\n\nLearning Center from a recycling program that provides a\n\nsafer playground for children solely because the\n\npreschool is operated by a church rather than a secular\n\nnot-for-profit.\n\nThe State has made several important\n\nconcessions in this case. Number one, that the policy\n\nin this case is not facially neutral, and number two,\n\nthat based on their religious character, churches are\n\nnot eligible for the benefit here.\n\nThis admitted discrimination against\n\nreligion violates this Court\u0027s Free Exercise Principles.\n\nFirst, as stated in McDaniel and Smith, the Free\n\nExercise Clause prevents the government from imposing\n\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious views or\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v.

Or are you\n\nsaying that it\u0027s -- that absent in Establishment Clause\n\nproblem, that status can never be the base -- religious\n\nstatus can never be the basis for a governmental action\n\nor governmental ordinance, governmental statute?\n\nMR. CORTMAN: I -- I\u0027m not sure if it can\n\nbe. I can\u0027t think of a specific example. And the\n\nreason I say that is, the question is, is why would\n\nsomeone\u0027s religious status matter in the first place to\n\nreceiving a government benefit? And that\u0027s another --\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On that -- on that\n\nquestion, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson\n\ncase back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms\n\nwhat the Framers didn\u0027t want was tax money imposed to\n\npay for building or maintaining churches or church\n\nproperty. And doesn\u0027t that fit this case? And if so,\n\nis Everson passé?\n\nMR.

And the reason for that is if you look at the\n\nplay in joints, the first conclusion was there was no\n\nFree Exercise violation there. Here, there clearly is.\n\nIf you look at the Court\u0027s case law under Sherbert and\n\nMcDaniel and McCauley and Smith, this is clearly\n\nsingling out a religious organization with no\n\njustification to do so.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nJust three points in rebuttal.\n\nFirst of all, as to the endorsement problem,\n\nI think the neutral government criteria here take care\n\nof the endorsement problem. So when you have this\n\ncompetitive grant that you have to fill out this -- this\n\npretty complicated application, 16 neutral criteria,\n\nthere is no endorsement of religion. I think the free\n\nspeech cases give a good analogue to that.\n\nNumber 2, as far as the selective or\n\nuniversal government benefit program, I don\u0027t think that\n\nis really the test here. And the reason, as Your Honors\n\nmention, if this was open to all schools, and it was\n\nuniversal, they still would be prohibited from giving a\n\ngrant to a religious organization. So whether it\u0027s a\n\nnarrow class of all non-for-profits, or a broader class\n\nof all schools, they would still not be able to fund\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nbased on their constitution.\n\nAnd lastly, as we talk about entanglement,\n\nthis is not an entanglement issue. Entanglement\n\ngenerally is an ongoing, intrusive surveillance. It\u0027s\n\nnot a one-time grant where you have to show a receipt\n\nfor the expense to receive the reimbursement.\n\nIf there are no other questions, I yield my\n\ntime.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"59","file_name":"Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v.
