The Merit\n\nSystems Protection Board.\n\nMr. Landau.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. LANDAU: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nThe parties here agree that a Federal\n\nemployee has a mixed case when he alleges that he was\n\naffected by an appealable civil service action and\n\ndiscrimination. The parties dispute whether the case\n\nceases to be a mixed case if and when the Board decides\n\nthat the employee hasn\u0027t proven that he was affected by\n\nan appealable civil service action. The answer to that\n\nquestion is no.\n\nWhenever the Board rejects an employee\u0027s\n\nallegations that he was affected by an appealable civil\n\nservice action, the Board is making a substantive\n\ndecision on the merits of the employee\u0027s civil service\n\nclaim. That point has nothing to do with the Board\u0027s\n\njurisdiction and, therefore, nothing to do with whether\n\nthe employee has brought a mixed case reviewable in\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Perry v.

Our rule turns on the\n\nlanguage that this Court focused on in Kloeckner, which\n\nsays you have a mixed case if you\u0027ve been subject to the\n\nsort of action which you can appeal to the Board.\n\nThat\u0027s all we mean by \"jurisdictional.\"\n\nAnd the second point, I take your point that\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n35\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nmany of the employees who proceed through this process\n\nare pro se, and that\u0027s why the process takes steps to\n\nprotect their rights.\n\nAt the end of every Board decision is an\n\nadvisory about appeal rights.

Circuit\u0027s opinion. It explains that the board\u0027s\n\ngeneral view, which has been upheld by the Federal\n\nCircuit, is that a voluntarily-accepted action is not an\n\nadverse action that\u0027s subject to the Board\u0027s\n\njurisdiction.\n\nSo here, take the resignation. Petitioner\n\nfacially resigned or retired his employment. The board\n\nonly has jurisdiction over removal. And so the board\n\nhas said, ordinarily, obviously, we wouldn\u0027t have\n\njurisdiction over retirement, but if you can show that\n\nyou were coerced into retiring, we\u0027ll treat that like a\n\nconstructive removal, within our authority to hear;\n\nwe\u0027ll treat that like an appealable action.\n\nAnd I think the -- the rule that\u0027s at issue\n\nhere -- and I just want to point out, even if you don\u0027t\n\nagree with me on this, that\u0027s not really the question\n\npresented in this case. The case comes to the Court on\n\nthe premise that this was decided on appealability\n\ngrounds.\n\nAnd even if you disagree that this\n\nparticular ground is, in fact, an appealability ground,\n\nlots of them are.
