Based on that provision,\n\nthe PTO denied Respondent\u0027s application to register The\n\nSlants as a service mark for his band. The PTO\u0027s ruling\n\ndid not limit Respondent\u0027s ability to use the mark in\n\ncommerce, or otherwise to engage in expression or debate\n\non any subject he wishes.\n\nBecause Section 52(a)\u0027s disparagement\n\nprovision places a reasonable limit on access to a\n\ngovernment program rather than a restriction on speech,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Lee v.

the\n\nnoncommercial aspects of the trademark, but it seems to\n\nme that that\u0027s an awfully blurry line. A lot of these\n\ntrademarks promote the commercial aspect, in fact, by\n\ndisparaging other groups. So they figure that it\u0027s a\n\nway to promote sales. How do you tell the difference\n\nbetween the commercial aspect of the trademark and the\n\nnoncommercial aspect?\n\nMR. CONNELL: The commercial aspect is that\n\npart of the mark that simply identifies the source of\n\nthe good or service in question. In the case of The\n\nSlants, there\u0027s another component, that being the\n\nnoncommercial, which communicates the political and\n\nsocial message of Asian pride.\n\nThis is akin to Justice Breyer before\n\ntalking about the in -- inherit advertisement that can\n\ntake place. Bands don\u0027t exist without names, and -- and\n\npeople associate the music with the band name and the\n\nband name with the music that they perform.\n\nSo that -- that is where the noncommercial\n\naspect of -- of the speech comes in.

STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nLet make three quick points.\n\nMr. Connell has said that the government --\n\nthat the government registration program regulates only\n\nthe expressive and not the commercial aspect of the\n\nmark, and I think that\u0027s getting it exactly backwards.\n\nThe -- Mr. Tam wants to do two things with the mark The\n\nSlants. He wants to use the mark himself in relation to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"48","file_name":"Lee v.

It may limit the remedies that are\n\navailable for infringement, but -- but that\u0027s entirely\n\nregulating the commercial aspects of the conduct.\n\nThe second thing is Mr. Connell\u0027s position\n\nclearly is that the test for constitutionality of a\n\nregistration condition is, could the government ban this\n\nspeech altogether? And putting that in place would\n\neviscerate the trademark registration program. Most\n\nobviously, as -- as Justice Kagan has pointed out, there\n\nare a lot of other content-based registration criteria.\n\nAnd in addition, I\u0027d point out one of the\n\nprerequisites to registration is that you be using the\n\nmark in commerce. If this were truly a suppression of\n\nspeech, we\u0027d ask by what authority could the government\n\nmake the right to speech contingent on providing goods\n\nand services in commerce.\n\nFinally, Justice Kagan, you mentioned\n\ncommercial speech.
