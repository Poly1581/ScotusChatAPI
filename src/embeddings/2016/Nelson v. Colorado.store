BANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 When a judgment is reversed, a person who\n\n11 has paid money pursuant to the judgment is entitled to\n\n12 get the money back. That\u0027s common sense, and that has,\n\n13 unsurprisingly, been normal practice for centuries.\n\n14 As far as we can tell, Colorado is the first\n\n15 State ever to adopt a rule to the contrary. In Colorado\n\n16 now, when a judgment of conviction is reversed, the\n\n17 State keeps the defendant\u0027s money unless the defendant\n\n18 files a separate civil action and can prove, by clear\n\n19 and convincing evidence, that she\u0027s actually innocent.\n\n20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the basis of -­\n\n21 of the right?

City of Joliet case this Court\n\n5 encountered. There would be a claim for compensation\n\n6 due to a wrongful defect in the due process in the\n\n7 procedures that led to that deprivation.\n\n8 But the question here, there was no wrongful\n\n9 conduct that occurred, there was an error that occurred.\n\n10 And the way that this Court\u0027s precedents have treated\n\n11 that is not as a return for property but as a claim for\n\n12 compensation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"47","file_name":"Nelson v.
