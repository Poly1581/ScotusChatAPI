One, there\n\nwas direct evidence that they moved 70 -- or 50,000 --\n\n15,000 people are all black.

Now, you may\n\ndisagree with me on this, but I think the -- what makes\n\na Shaw claim a Shaw claim is not that somebody is kept\n\nin a perfectly formed district in a community of\n\ninterest based on race. It\u0027s the particular injury in a\n\nShaw claim is that people from different parts of the\n\nState who would share nothing in common except the color\n\nof their skin are grouped together in the same district.\n\nThat\u0027s what makes a Shaw claim different from other\n\nkinds of claims.\n\nAnd I completely agree with the Solicitor\n\nGeneral\u0027s office that in thinking about this question,\n\nyou should be thinking about Shaw claims and thinking\n\nabout them separately from vote dilution claims.\n\nAnd I think there\u0027s a real problem in this\n\narea of the law is what\u0027s happened is that Shaw, which\n\nstarted as a doctrine for outlying districts in outlying\n\nclaims, has become the weapon of choice in redistricting\n\nlitigation, and people see Shaw violations everywhere.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n43\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"44","file_name":"Bethune-Hill v.
