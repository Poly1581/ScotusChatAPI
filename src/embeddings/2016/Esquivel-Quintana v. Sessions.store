I -- I will concede that. But the --\n\nthe immigration defense brief at page 13 posits a theory\n\nas to why Congress may not have included a\n\ncross-reference here where it did other places, and it\n\nhas to do with the jurisdictional nature of the element\n\nin the Federal crime.\n\nBut even if you set that aside, what you\n\nhave is one canon, and you have other canons and another\n\ncanon that\u0027s very strong through the Court\u0027s cases.

This is the case where\n\nSection 2243 and the State multi-jurisdictional survey\n\nplus the Model Penal Code leads you to the exact same\n\nplace. So it\u0027s enough in this case to say, at least\n\nwhere those two things line up, it is certainly the case\n\nthat Congress would not have been intending to sweep in","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"7","file_name":"Esquivel-Quintana v.

It\n\nhas been amended a number of times, both before and\n\nafter the amendment that added the aggravated felony of\n\nsexual abuse of a minor.\n\nAnd the courts did not do what it did in a\n\nnumber of other provisions, which is to include a cross\n\nreference.

do I understand the situation\n\ncorrectly?\n\nIn mid 1990s, Congress passed a law in\n\nimmigration statute, which is this 1101(a)(43), which\n\nlists about 30 or 40 crimes. And it says if the person\n\nhas committed one of those, goodbye, and the Attorney\n\nGeneral can\u0027t stop it; is that right?\n\nMR.

KEDEM: That\u0027s correct.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. When they stuck in\n\nthose words in this long list of crimes, some of which\n\nhave cross references and some of which, like in that\n\nvery section, murder, rape, deceit, et cetera, do not.\n\nAt the time they did that, in 1996 -- I think it was\n\n\u002796, or maybe \u002795 -- there was on the books a Federal\n\nstatute which had been passed in 1986. And that Federal\n\nstatute, by some amazing coincidence, which was a\n\ncriminal law, is entitled sexual abuse of a minor. And\n\nthen it has a definition.\n\nSo why not?

All of those States\n\nhave laws dealing with 16 year olds, or -- or 15 year\n\nold ages of consent, or slightly younger. So you\u0027re\n\nstill going to get the people that Congress most wanted\n\nthe law to apply to.\n\nAnd just take an example like Georgia. It\n\nhas a law making it a crime for anyone to have sex with\n\nsomebody who\u0027s under 16, with no age differential at\n\nall. Even if you wanted to pick up the age differential\n\nin Section 2243, it still wouldn\u0027t be a problem in that\n\nstate because Georgia has a second law making it a\n\nfelony as opposed to a misdemeanor when there\u0027s a\n\nfour-year age differential. So you find this time and\n\nagain in the State laws that you don\u0027t have a serious\n\nproblem with consequences.\n\nNext, the Solicitor General talked about\n\nSection 2243 if you were to adopt that definition, in\n\nleaving out things like familial abuse or abuse of\n\nauthority and the like.\n\nNow we agree, or at least our position is\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n57\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"57","file_name":"Esquivel-Quintana v.

So the\n\nfamilial abuse, like my friend here is describing, would\n\nbe picked up in a separate subsection of the INA.

At the end of the\n\nday, it\u0027s Congress\u0027s choice whether to have a statute\n\napply in both settings. And I think it\u0027s reasonable to\n\nconclude that if Congress has a statute applying in both\n\nsettings, it wants it, first of all, to mean the same\n\nthing, and second of all, it doesn\u0027t intend the agency\n\nto have power over that particular provision.\n\nIf the Court has any questions about our\n\napproach or about what I\u0027ve said, I\u0027m happy to answer\n\nthem, otherwise I\u0027ll submit the case.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n\nCase is submitted.\n\n(Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the\n\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOOffffiicciiaall -- SSuubbjjeecctt ttoo FFiinnaall RReevviieeww\n\n60\n\nA acted 55:23 19:6,14 38:25 amendment 47:8 49:23","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"60","file_name":"Esquivel-Quintana v.
