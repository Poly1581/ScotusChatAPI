But I think in this circumstance,\n\neveryone recognized that there was a threat facing these\n\nofficers who are going about doing their police business\n\nin good faith, and they see a person pointing what\n\nappeared to be a gun at them. And what the Ninth\n\nCircuit said is: We\u0027re going to second-guess everything\n\nelse that you did that day, and even though this use of\n\nforce was reasonable under Graham, we\u0027re going to hold\n\nyou liable for it.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it -- it --\n\nI just want to put the discussion so far this morning in\n\nthe right framework.

in the Section 1983 context, it has said as a\n\ngeneral matter it would start with tort law principles,\n\nand I think those would include proximate causation and\n\nsuperseding-cause principles.\n\nBut we have a problem in this case in what\n\nthe Ninth Circuit found was the proximate cause of the\n\ninjuries in this case was the failure to knock and\n\nannounce. But the fail -- failure to knock and announce\n\nwas not a violation of clearly established law. The\n\nofficers have qualified immunity for that.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So that seems fair enough.\n\nBut then the question might become, whether here or on\n\nremand, whether an unauthorized entry, where there was a\n\nclearly established violation, whether one could say\n\nthat that was the proximate cause of the shooting.\n\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. And I think there\u0027s two\n\nanswers to that question, one about this case and\n\nsecond, more generally.\n\nAbout this case, the analysis by the Ninth\n\nCircuit was that it was the knock-and-announce and not\n\nthe warrant, and if I could just illustrate this. In\n\nthis case, you had officers that did not have a warrant\n\nand did not knock and announce.

gun.\n\nAnd I would agree with the comments that\n\nwere made earlier that this isn\u0027t about telling police\n\nofficers they can\u0027t take actions to protect themselves.\n\nWe know that they will. The question in the end is who\n\nbears the brunt of the officers\u0027 unreasonable conduct?\n\nBecause there\u0027s no allegation here that the Mendezes did\n\nanything wrong.\n\nIf somebody comes into your house and you\n\nmove a gun, you have a Second Amendment right to do\n\nthat. If you\u0027re in the privacy of your own home, the\n\nFourth Amendment tells you that you can do anything you\n\nwant as long as it\u0027s not illegal. And moving a gun\n\ncertainly isn\u0027t illegal.\n\nSo in the end, what happened here was\n\nprompted by the officers, not by the Mendezes. The only\n\nexception to that, of course, is the superseding cause\n\ndoctrine. And we believe that this Court can resolve\n\nthis entire case based on the superseding cause doctrine\n\nand the fact that the proximate cause doctrine, we\n\nsubmit, was not properly --\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let\u0027s go to that","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"51","file_name":"County of Los Angeles v.
