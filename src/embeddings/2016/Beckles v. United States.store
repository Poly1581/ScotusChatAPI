your argument be the same then?\n\n7 MR.\n\nDREEBEN: Well, we -- we made a version\n\n8 of that argument in Peugh and this Court rejected it,\n\n9 and I think empirical evidence is not suggesting that\n\n10 sentencing courts are drifting radically away from the\n\n11 Guidelines, and one of the reasons for that is there\u0027s a\n\n12 feedback loop in place where the Commission examines the\n\n13 Guidelines in practice, takes note when district judges\n\n14 are varying or departing from them, and incorporates\n\n15 those refinements into the Guidelines.\n\n16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe not\n\n17 radically departing, but steadily increasing their\n\n18 departures, isn\u0027t that right?\n\n19 MR. DREEBEN: I don\u0027t think so,\n\n20 Mr. Chief Justice. I looked at the statistics this\n\n21 weekend, and there is a trend line that hovers around\n\n22 the 80 percent level for within-range sentences, plus\n\n23 the government-sponsored departures, which are\n\n24 incorporated into the Guidelines and recognized as not\n\n25 being non-guideline sentence because the government is\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n31\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 seeking them within the framework of the Guidelines.\n\n2 So the Guidelines are continuing to have an\n\n3 influential role in Federal sentencing, as they are\n\n4 intended to do precisely because the Commission is\n\n5 looking at the same 3553(a) factors that the district\n\n6 court judge does.

the purpose of that would\n\n5 be to get better guidelines.\n\n6 MR.\n\nDREEBEN: So, Justice Breyer, I agree\n\n7 with the impulse of that question to the extent that\n\n8 we\u0027re talking about the enumerated offenses in the\n\n9 commentary. I think that those, whether they are viewed\n\n10 as construing the language of the residual clause or\n\n11 providing an independent specification of what is a\n\n12 crime of violence, they satisfy due process vagueness\n\n13 concerns.\n\n14 Where I part company with that description\n\n15 of how the constitutional analysis is affected is that\n\n16 the Commission selected the residual clause language to\n\n17 mirror the ACCA residual clause.\n\n18 JUSTICE BREYER: We know that because this\n\n19 is -- the words I read you are just one set of what I\n\n20 bet are hundreds of examples in these Guidelines if you\n\n21 go through and think it doesn\u0027t make too much sense.\n\n22 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think -- no, I\u0027d like\n\n23 to come back to whether the Guidelines are vague as a\n\n24 general matter, because I don\u0027t think they are. I spent\n\n25 a lot of time going through them this weekend, and I was\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n35\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 amazed at how specific they are and how they do mirror\n\n2 things that are customarily elements of offense.\n\n3 Serious bodily injury is a very customary element of the\n\n4 offense.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"33","file_name":"Beckles v.

DREEBEN: So, Justice Sotomayor, let me\n\n10 try to take the conceptual point and then the practical\n\n11 point. Conceptually, Montgomery interpreted Miller v.\n\n12 Alabama as basically requiring a finding to go to a life\n\n13 sentence, a finding of incorrigibility that prior law\n\n14 had not required. And if that finding was not made, the\n\n15 defendant is not eligible for a life sentence if he\u0027s a\n\n16 juvenile homicide defendant.\n\n17 So Montgomery, rather than looking at Miller\n\n18 and saying, well, is it likely or unlikely that youths\n\n19 will get a life sentence, it interpreted Miller as\n\n20 imposing an eligibility requirement. And that is why it\n\n21 satisfied habeas, not because there was some likelihood\n\n22 analysis.\n\n23 If likelihood was the test, the Court would\n\n24 not have had to go through the analysis that it did and\n\n25 focus on the incorrigibility aspect. And that\u0027s what\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n39\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 distinguishes Miller from a Guideline situation.\n\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But doesn\u0027t a judge\n\n3 still have to make a finding that there\u0027s a reason to\n\n4 give a defendant a higher sentence?

And that weight in part comes\n\n23 from Rita, which says that -- that an appellate court\n\n24 can presume a within-Guideline sentence is reasonable,\n\n25 because that reflects the judgment of both the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n50\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 Commission and the sentencing judge that the 3553(a)\n\n2 factors have been met.\n\n3 But that\u0027s actually not true with the career\n\n4 offender enhancement, and that\u0027s because the career\n\n5 offender enhancement exists at the command of Congress\n\n6 in 994(h). The Commission is not actually deploying its\n\n7 expertise when it made the career offender enhancement.\n\n8 It\u0027s doing something it was commanded to do, which is\n\n9 make sure that sentences get at or near the statutory\n\n10 maximum.\n\n11 So the rationale for the reasonableness\n\n12 presumption of Rita completely goes away with the career\n\n13 offender guideline, and that\u0027s why the career offender\n\n14 enhancement should not get that kind of weight and\n\n15 that\u0027s why it doesn\u0027t.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"49","file_name":"Beckles v.

And here, just like Montgomery,\n\n20 it will be the rare case where a court can impose the\n\n21 same sentence once the defender -- the defendant no\n\n22 longer qualifies as a career offender.
