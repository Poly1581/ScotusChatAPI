think it makes sense that Congress would\n\nhave wanted veterans to keep all their disability pay\n\nfor the obvious reason that it\u0027s the veteran who\u0027s\n\ndisabled. And the point of the disability pay is to\n\nsubstitute for income that the veteran can\u0027t earn\n\nbecause of his or her disability. That\u0027s how it\u0027s\n\ndefined. You get a disability rating if you have a\n\nreduced income potential. And so I think that this --\n\nit makes perfect sense.

And\n\nthat\u0027s a pretty harsh judgment that Congress made,\n\nessentially, to protect the public fisc, but that\u0027s what\n\nCongress did.\n\nSo I think that what the statute is doing is\n\nsaying if the veteran is forced to do that, then the\n\nveteran and the ex-spouse will both have their amounts\n\nreduced by an equal amount; in other words, what\u0027s\n\ndivisible is just going to be the residual share. So I\n\nthink that\u0027s what this statute is doing.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"13","file_name":"Howell v.

EISENSTEIN: I think that\u0027s a\n\nsignificant difference.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That\u0027s the only\n\ndifference. So in other words, if it says, no, you\n\ncannot give the wife more than 50 percent of the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npension, then what they could do is have the decree, and\n\nit says the wife gets 50 percent, gets -- sorry -- you\n\ncan\u0027t -- you cannot give them more than 50 percent --\n\nI\u0027m getting mixed up in my thing.\n\nIt says you can\u0027t give more than 50 percent,\n\nand then there\u0027s a statute says you can\u0027t give -- you\n\ncan\u0027t give 60 percent, but the judge says, here\u0027s what\n\nI\u0027ll do: I\u0027ll give you 50 percent from this, and I\u0027d\n\nlike to give you more than 60 percent so I\u0027m going to\n\ntake 10 percent from something else.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"41","file_name":"Howell v.

I actually agree that finality in divorce\n\ndecrees is very important.\n\nAnd we\u0027re not -- our\n\nposition is not trying to alter, sort of, ordinarily\n\napplicable rules of res judicata.\n\nBut the question in this case is finality as\n\nto what. And we have an answer from the Arizona Supreme\n\nCourt. The court interpreted the decree to say that\n\nwhat it did was it divided Petitioner\u0027s pension,\n\nwhatever it was. And that is a ruling that I think we\n\nhave to accept as this case reaches the Court; that\u0027s a\n\nstate law interpretation which binds this Court.\n\nAnd so what the court held, however, is that\n\nit was not going to enforce the decree as written. It\n\nwas going to import a State law rule that basically says\n\nthat the relevant divisible asset was the total amount\n\nof the retirement pay and divide that.\n\nI think the court is quite clear. It\u0027s\n\nsaying that it conceptualizes the property interests as\n\nthe total amount of money that Petitioner was receiving,\n\nand it said that by waiving retirement pay, the\n\nPetitioner converted a portion of respondent\u0027s property.\n\nAnd so it\u0027s saying that Respondent holds a property\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ninterest in half of that waived amount.
