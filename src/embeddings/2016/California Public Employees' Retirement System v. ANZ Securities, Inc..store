ANZ Securities.\n\nMr. Goldstein.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\n\nplease the Court:\n\nWe ask you to hold that American Pipe\n\ntolling applies to both of the time limits set forth in\n\nSection 13 of the Securities Act, which is reproduced in\n\na number of places, including the blue brief at the top\n\nof page 3.\n\nThe other side has a tendency to invoke the\n\nphrase \"statute of repose,\" which isn\u0027t really\n\nself-defining in the phrase, in no event, when there\u0027s\n\nmore going on in the statute than that, so I thought I\n\nwould just start with the text, and it begins, \"no\n\naction\" -- and action is going to be the important noun\n\nhere.\n\n\"No action shall be maintained to enforce\n\nany liability created under Section 11 unless\n\nbrought\" -- and that\u0027s going to be the operative thing\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"California Public Employees\u0027 Retirement System v.

GOLDSTEIN: And so what we know from\n\nthat, I think, is, as American Pipe tells us, that the\n\nclass action complaint commences the action on behalf of\n\neach unnamed class member, and in the wording of Section\n\n13, it brings the action on behalf of every unnamed\n\nclass member.\n\nSo the class complaint in our case, which\n\nwas filed within a year, brought the action on our\n\nbehalf.\n\nNow, the second sentence says, and it\u0027s the\n\none at issue in the case before you, \"in no event shall\n\nany such action,\" referring to the one in the previous\n\nsentence, \"be brought to enforce a liability created\n\nunder Section 11 more than three years after the\n\nsecurity was bona fide offered to the public.\"\n\nAnd so what happens, we believe, is that\n\njust as the action was brought by the class action\n\ncomplaint within one year, it was also brought within\n\nnecessarily three years. It was brought and it was\n\nbrought on our behalf.\n\nAnd we don\u0027t think that there\u0027s anything in\n\nthis sentence that is concerned with the application of\n\nsomething like American Pipe tolling, which is an\n\ninterpretation of Rule 23.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n6\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nIf it doesn\u0027t apply here, we think, then","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"3","file_name":"California Public Employees\u0027 Retirement System v.

Class action practice was a situation in\n\nwhich a representative action would be brought and then\n\npeople would opt in at the very end. This was an\n\nunresolved question --\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yeah. So what did Congress\n\nhave in mind when it wrote this?\n\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. What it had in mind\n\nwas letting the other side know that the claim had been\n\nasserted against it, and that the class action does.\n\nWhat it wanted was a party like ANZ or Lehman to know,\n\nokay, here\u0027s the scope of your potential liability.\n\nAnd what American Pipe says in terms is that\n\nthe classic complaint tells the other side everything it\n\nneeds to know, whether it\u0027s litigated on a collective\n\nbasis or instead on an individual basis. And what it\n\nsays is we are not going to generate all of these\n\nunnecessary motions to intervene, all of these\n\nunnecessary individual lawsuits because we\u0027re going to\n\ninterpret Rule 23 and these Federal statutes together.\n\nAnd so if I can just give you an illustration from your\n\nown docket.

I would not get\n\npast the first step of that argument because I would say\n\nthey\u0027re seeking to recover on an action that they\n\nvoluntarily filed in California when the rest of this\n\nclass action was going on in the Southern District of\n\nNew York, and it\u0027s just not the same action. So you\u0027d\n\nlose me at step one.\n\nBut if you got to the policy arguments, I\n\nwould really -- if I were, you know, trying to like\n\nreally twist the statute in a way that I think doesn\u0027t\n\ncomport with its basic test, I would need different\n\nempirical data than we\u0027ve gotten from the Second\n\nCircuit.\n\nAnd to get back to Justice Kagan\u0027s point --\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And we do have -- we do\n\nhave two briefs, one by retired federal judges, one by\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"46","file_name":"California Public Employees\u0027 Retirement System v.

So whatever happened\n\nin Rule 23, I think in light of the PSLRA, this is\n\nactually a better result.\n\nBut as to the opt-out right, the opt-out\n\nright gives you a right not to be bound by a judgment\n\nthat you had no business in procuring.

What they want\n\nus to do is to intervene in the class action on day 1\n\nand then do nothing and sit back. And when we\n\neventually would otherwise intervene, then spin up our\n\nlawsuit.
