our principal practical concerns here\n\nstem from the breadth of the Federal Circuit\u0027s ruling,\n\nand it\u0027s broad because they are asking a loaded question\n\nthat\u0027s looking only at part of the picture.\n\nIf you look only at the supplied portion of\n\nthe components and you ask whether they are important or\n\nessential to the operation or novelty of the invention,\n\nthe answer is always going to be yes. In most\n\ninventions, if you take away any component, it isn\u0027t\n\ngoing to work and it\u0027s not going to be patentable. So\n\nwe think you just can\u0027t come at it that way.\n\nAnd then the second piece is that the\n\nFederal Circuit isn\u0027t looking at all the components that\n\nwere not supplied, and so they are not asking the\n\ncomparative question of whether the person has done\n\nanything similar to supplying all of the components.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n20\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd we think that\u0027s just a critical piece here.

Because unless you can explain\n\nthat, I don\u0027t know how to give meaning to \"all or\n\nsubstantially all\" the components.\n\nAnd -- and I do find the government\u0027s\n\nargument that it\u0027s hard to say that \"substantial\" means\n\njust something that\u0027s critical to the invention. Every\n\nstep is critical to an invention. You take out the\n\nstep, the invention doesn\u0027t work.\n\nMR.

What it said is, there has to be a substantial\n\nportion, all or a substantial portion. And that\u0027s a\n\nfundamentally significant independent requirement that\n\ncannot be satisfied in a situation where you\u0027re talking\n\nabout a single component.\n\nJustice Sotomayor, I just wanted to respond\n\nto your -- you know, the three that are major, it\u0027s\n\nimportant to recognize that two of those are clearly not\n\ncoming from the United States. So I go back to the\n\npoint you made later, which is, if there are three major\n\ncomponents, how can one of them be the substantial one?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"56","file_name":"Life Technologies Corp. v.
