BLATT\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n9 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n10 and may it please the Court:\n\n11 For three reasons, acquittals should have\n\n12 full effect under the Double Jeopardy Clause without\n\n13 regard to invalid vacated convictions.\n\n14 First, vacated convictions are legal\n\n15 nullities, including under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\n16 Second, vacated convictions are not relevant to what a\n\n17 jury necessarily decided. And third, the government\n\n18 should bear the consequences when overlapping charges\n\n19 produce split verdicts of acquittals and invalid\n\n20 convictions.\n\n21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it from that you\n\n22 would agree that there might be cases where, under\n\n23 Ashe v. Swenson, there\u0027s an acquittal on one count,\n\n24 conviction on the other count, conviction set aside,\n\n25 government can retry the count that had been set aside,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Bravo-Fernandez v.

It\u0027s not guilt\n\n6 in the way the law recognizes.\n\n7 But I do think there\u0027s something quite\n\n8 unseemly about when the Court in Yeager said if you have\n\n9 the continuing -- if hung counts are void and a nonevent\n\n10 under the continuing jeopardy principle, they\u0027re also\n\n11 void and nonevents under Ashe. And here the government\n\n12 has it -- well, they got to count -- they at least count\n\n13 for something when it helps us, in it\u0027s not only\n\n14 rendering the clause incoherent but kind of perverse.\n\n15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the basic\n\n16 point that was made in Yeager made over and over again\n\n17 is that when the jury is hung, the jury hasn\u0027t done\n\n18 anything. So the defendant in that case was able to\n\n19 carry the burden that the jury hasn\u0027t done anything. So\n\n20 we\u0027re right back to the typical Ashe case.\n\n21 But this is very different.

is the\n\n5 supposition of this case.\n\n6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You\u0027re -- you\u0027re saying it\n\n7 is highly doubtful if the government had charged just\n\n8 counts 2 and 3 and got an acquittal, and that they could\n\n9 then have had a second trial under 666. You\u0027re saying\n\n10 that just couldn\u0027t happen under Ashe v. Swenson.\n\n11 MS. BLATT: That\u0027s exactly right. Yes.\n\n12 Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes.\n\n13 And the point I\u0027m making about once you have\n\n14 the acquittal is that -- and I do think this was going\n\n15 on in Yeager, because the whole point of the\n\n16 government\u0027s brief is we get one complete opportunity.\n\n17 Yeah, I know it\u0027s a nullity, but let\u0027s pretend it\u0027s not\n\n18 really a nullity here. But at least we need one\n\n19 complete opportunity.\n\n20 And there were a lot of questions about why\n\n21 should the principles of Ashe outweigh? And the answer\n\n22 was because of sort of the -- the special status\n\n23 acquittals have. They\u0027re sacrosanct.

And in fact, it\u0027s -- it\u0027s also the case that the\n\n14 conviction can be relevant to help the defendant, not\n\n15 just harm the defendant, by actually clarifying the\n\n16 basis of an accompanying verdict that might otherwise be\n\n17 ambiguous.\n\n18 We cite a case that does this, the Velasquez\n\n19 case from the Third Circuit. The way that that\n\n20 situation works is that if a defendant, for example, has\n\n21 defended on multiple theories, let\u0027s say it\u0027s a\n\n22 conspiracy case and he said there was no agreement and\n\n23 no overt act, he won\u0027t be able to establish, in\n\n24 acquittal, which basis the jury accepted in returning\n\n25 that verdict.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n34\n\n1 But if there\u0027s a separate conviction in the\n\n2 case, maybe overlapping with the overt act, even if that\n\n3 conviction is set aside, the defendant could point to it\n\n4 and say this shows that the jury must have resolved the\n\n5 agreement issue in my favor on that separate verdict of\n\n6 acquittal.\n\n7 So this isn\u0027t an argument that -- that\n\n8 convictions are relevant only when they benefit the\n\n9 government, or that we\u0027re able to use them to the\n\n10 defendant\u0027s disadvantage.

And so petitioners\u0027 suggestion\n\n15 that this fails to accord respect to verdicts I think is\n\n16 out of sync with how general preclusion principles\n\n17 operate.\n\n18 Imagine again my conspiracy example where\n\n19 the defendant offers two defenses and says there was no\n\n20 agreement and no overt act. In that situation, if the\n\n21 jury acquits and we have a general verdict of acquittal,\n\n22 we won\u0027t be able to ascertain the exact argument that\n\n23 the jury adopted.

ultimately the potential difference in standards\n\n3 wouldn\u0027t have affected the analysis, because the court\n\n4 concluded that there was -- that there was sufficient\n\n5 evidence on the proper quid pro quo theory, also\n\n6 evidence that would have supported a bribery theory.\n\n7 And so the court just couldn\u0027t tell either way on what\n\n8 ground the jury would have possibly grounded this\n\n9 verdict.\n\n10 Ultimately, though, I think in light of that\n\n11 error, the appropriate result is the ordinary remedy\n\n12 here, a retrial. Petitioners are only entitled to avoid\n\n13 that remedy if they can carry their burden, and it\u0027s a\n\n14 stringent one, of showing that the jury actually\n\n15 resolved issues in their favor in this litigation.\n\n16 They haven\u0027t carried that burden here. They\n\n17 seek to be excused from it based on the legal error.\n\n18 But they haven\u0027t actually carried the error -- carried\n\n19 the burden of showing that that jury that returned those\n\n20 inconsistent verdicts necessarily thought they were not\n\n21 guilty of committing quid pro quo bribery.\n\n22 Unless the court has further questions, we\u0027d\n\n23 respectfully ask that you affirm the judgment of the\n\n24 First Circuit.\n\n25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n46\n\n1 Ms. Blatt, you have five minutes remaining.\n\n2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S.
