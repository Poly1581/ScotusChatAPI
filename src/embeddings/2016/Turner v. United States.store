Maryland, this Court established\n\nthe now familiar principle that the prosecution must\n\ndisclose to the defense all favorable and material\n\ninformation. This case involves a clear violation of\n\nthat principle. Here the prosecution suppressed\n\ninformation that a serial assaulter of women had been\n\nseen acting suspiciously at the crime scene before\n\npolice arrived. The prosecution further suppressed that\n\nthis man\u0027s girlfriend was in the alley at the time, yet\n\nhe did not speak to her and she did not speak to him.\n\nIf this information had been available to Petitioners at\n\ntrial, they would have presented an alternative\n\nperpetrator\u0027s theory that centered on this incredibly\n\nviolent individual.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nThey would have told the jury that during\n\nOctober 1984, in this neighborhood, this man committed\n\nsimilar assaults against similar victims.

In so doing, Justice Sotomayor, the\n\nprosecutor went further and he made statements that\n\nperhaps not deliberately, in fact, still did mislead the\n\ndefense counsel about the probative value of this\n\ninformation, because he said first that Mr. McMillan had\n\nno association with the garage. That\u0027s not true.

WILLIAMS: Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg.\n\nFirst, let me say I don\u0027t think they would have all had\n\nto do it. It would be enough if a substantial number\n\ndid it. But let me further add, I think they all would\n\nhave done it. And the best evidence for that is that\n\nMichelle Roberts, who was a leading criminal defense\n\nlawyer in the city at the time and was until very\n\nrecently, she also had one of the weakest cases against\n\nher client, a case so weak that the government now says\n\nit is perfectly logical that he was acquitted. And she\n\ntestified in our postconviction hearing that if she had\n\nbeen aware of the McMillan information, she would have\n\npursued an alternative perpetrator defense.\n\nSo we think the evidence in this case\n\nsuggests that all of the Petitioners would have\n\ndeveloped this theory and run with it.\n\nAnd if I may add, I think one of the reasons\n\nwhy they would have done that is that it\u0027s not that much\n\nof a difference from the not-me-maybe-them defense.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"6","file_name":"Turner v.

I think it\u0027s not impossible that\n\nthere could only be -- there could have been more than\n\none or two people, but the idea that there could be\n\nmultiple people in there committing a crime at that time\n\nalong with Mrs. Fuller being on the ground, that is what\n\nis unlikely.\n\nAnd I point out that in the post conviction\n\nhearing the lead prosecutor on the stand agreed with us\n\nthat it was highly unlikely that there was a large group\n\nin the garage with the doors closed if the crime was\n\nbeing committed at 5:30.

questions, Justice Ginsburg: Whether the jury\n\nbelieved everything that Alston and Bennett said, and\n\nthe question of whether they believed it that a group\n\nattack occurred. Petitioners can only raise any\n\nquestion about the verdict if they have a viable theory\n\nthat no group attack occurred at all. Their theory is\n\nthat, it\u0027s the guy who was never seen with the victim,\n\nnever seen in the garage. It\u0027s McMillan, not a group.\n\nNow the question of who was in the group is\n\na different matter all together and the defendant who\n\nwas acquitted Alphonso Harris -- among Harris had a\n\nvariety of things going for him that the other\n\ndefendants did not. He presented five alibi witnesses\n\nthat the government was not as successful.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Alito suggested\n\nearlier that a defense counsel might take the position,\n\nthere\u0027s evidence that indicates McMillan was the one who\n\ndid it. But at least my guy didn\u0027t, my guy was not part\n\nof any gang. So it\u0027s not necessary to say this is it.\n\nI\u0027m putting all my marbles on McMillan. The defense\n\ncounsel could say, \"McMillan is the most likely, but in\n\nany event my client wasn\u0027t there\".\n\nMR.

Subject to Final Review\n\ndeliberations because you can\u0027t understand what\u0027s going\n\non with Turner, Chris Turner and Overton, unless you\n\nunderstand that the jury deliberated carefully,\n\nconvicted six defendants and acquitted two defendants\n\nafter going through an elaborate process of considering\n\nthe evidence in a six-week trial, sending out a variety\n\nof notes that all required consideration of evidence and\n\nculminating in a request to see Yarborough\u0027s videotaped\n\nstatement, which he gave early on in the investigation\n\nin which he describes the group attack as a pincer\n\nmovement with two groups of people moving out of the\n\npark, surrounding the alley, 8th Street and 9th Street,\n\nand commencing the attack. So by the time that the jury\n\nhad convicted after watching the Overton -- the\n\nYarborough video again, they had concluded that a group\n\nattack occurred. They had found evidence sufficient to\n\nconvict beyond a reasonable doubt on six of the\n\ndefendants. Two of them, Lisa Ruffin, Monk Harris, they\n\nsaid there\u0027s not enough evidence to tie them in. I\n\nthink the evidence against Lisa Ruffin was particularly\n\nattenuated, and the evidence against Alphonso Harris was\n\njust different as we describe in our brief.\n\nSo by the time the jury is deliberating\n\nabout Overton and Chris Turner, they\u0027ve already decided\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that a group attack exists.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"29","file_name":"Turner v.

That\u0027s the\n\nDepartment of Justice\u0027s advice today, but at the time,\n\nthe prosecutor looking at the tenuous connection of\n\nMcMillan to the crime, the only evidence that we had\n\nwere some statements from witnesses which were not\n\nenough to prosecute that McMillan was actually involved\n\nin the group attack. Wasn\u0027t enough to prosecute him,\n\nbut there was certainly nothing that suggested that he\n\nalone secreted in the garage was somehow engaging in the\n\ncrime that six different witnesses told the jury had\n\noccurred as a group attack. And that was what he said\n\nto the judge. Michelle Roberts could have challenged\n\nthat and asked for a ruling on it. It wouldn\u0027t resolve\n\nthe Brady question because the Brady obligation is the\n\nprosecutors, it\u0027s not the responsibility of the judge.\n\nBut the fact that the defendants didn\u0027t\n\npress forward on that shows that they had very little\n\ninterest, I think, in trying to identify a mystery man\n\nas the person who had committed this crime alone rather\n\nthan taking the government\u0027s evidence as it seemed to\n\nbe, which was a strong case of a group attack, and the\n\nquestion was: Which defendants were inculpated in it?\n\nAnd if the Court has no further questions,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"50","file_name":"Turner v.
