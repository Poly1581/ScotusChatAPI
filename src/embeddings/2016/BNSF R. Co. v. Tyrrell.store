that, Congress\n\nknows how to do venue versus service of process.\n\nThat\n\nhas continued up through the Court\u0027s decision in Omni.\n\nSo we just don\u0027t think that Section 56\n\nshould be interpreted to be the first statute -- statute\n\nto do it, especially where the implication with respect\n\nto the second question would be to say that a company\n\nlike BNSF is subject to general

Well, the difference between\n\nbeing hauled into court for claims that arise out of or\n\nare related to the context with the State, as opposed to\n\nclaims that are just any kind of possible claims. And I\n\nthink the reason that the Court talked about you being\n\nat home is because it\u0027s the equivalent of like domicile\n\nfor a person. It said what\u0027s the equivalent of a\n\ncorporation? A place where it voluntarily chooses to go\n\nto do its business. It gets the benefits of that\n\nState\u0027s law, and then it means that it also has to have\n\nthe burdens. And the burdens are not just that you\n\nwould be subject to any claim -- or to the claims that\n\nare related to the State, but to any kind of claim.\n\nSo in somewhere where there is that kind of\n\nrelationship that the corporation has in terms of\n\nincorporation or principal place of business, it\u0027s fair\n\nfor the corporation, like a person, where they\u0027re\n\ndomiciled, to have to answer for any type of claim. But\n\nif we\u0027re talking about somewhere that you -- that the\n\ncorporation is just doing business where it\u0027s not\n\nconsidered at home, it\u0027s fair, the Court said, for the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n18\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncorporation in that circumstance to have to answer for","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"16","file_name":"BNSF R.

Subject to Final Review\n\nworkers could still get specific jurisdiction over the\n\nrailroads in a place close to their home. That\u0027s simply\n\nnot going to be the case for many of these workers.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is -- why is\n\nthat?\n\nMS. MURRAY: Well, I think Congress\n\nrecognized in 1910 the railroad industry is unique. You\n\nhave, in many cases, workers traveling five, six, seven\n\nhours, even to get to their starting work point where\n\nthey then travel farther away. So if you look, for\n\nexample, at Mr. Nelson, he is a resident of the State of\n\nMontana. He was injured in the State of Washington.\n\nAnd under BNSF\u0027s view, he would either have to go to\n\nWashington, he\u0027d have to go to Tarrant County, Texas, or\n\nhe could go to Delaware. That\u0027s simply not the outcome\n\nthat Congress ever would have predicted, given the\n\nlanguage that it adopted in 1910. And what we know it\n\nwas trying to do when it adopted that language.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why didn\u0027t it say\n\nthe action could be brought at plaintiff\u0027s residence?\n\nMS. MURRAY: Well, it considered that, Your\n\nHonor. And, in fact, it -- the reason it didn\u0027t have\n\nplaintiff\u0027s residence language is because industry said\n\nwe don\u0027t want to have to defend suit in the plaintiff\u0027s","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"20","file_name":"BNSF R.

TULUMELLO: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nJust a couple points. First, the Montana\n\nSupreme Court held that it did not need to apply this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Daimler based on Daimler\u0027s\n\ntransnational facts and because BNSF is a domestic\n\nrailroad. We think neither rationale is persuasive.\n\nAnd at least with respect to railroads being\n\nunique, we don\u0027t read these -- this Court\u0027s due process\n\ncases as saying due process protection depends on the\n\nparticular line of business that you\u0027re in.\n\nThere are -- you know, as to movement and\n\nownership of property, there are many industries, cable\n\ncompanies, agriculture businesses, and so forth, that\n\nhave physical plants and that transport people across\n\nthe country.\n\nAnd then with respect to FELA, we don\u0027t\n\nthink it would be helpful or faithful to the text or\n\nlegislative history to interpret Section 56 in a way\n\nthat grants personal jurisdiction when no other special\n\nvenue statute or general venue statute has ever done so.\n\nSo we respectfully ask that the Montana\n\nSupreme Court judgment be reversed.\n\nThank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"43","file_name":"BNSF R.
