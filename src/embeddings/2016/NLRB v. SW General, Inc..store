putting weight\n\n11 on the fact that they didn\u0027t do anything. And you say\n\n12 you\u0027ve got other arguments, too, and I appreciate that,\n\n13 but what did they do, then?\n\n14 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Absolutely, Your\n\n15 Honor. No, I am putting weight on what they didn\u0027t do.\n\n16 To me, it is very much the dog that didn\u0027t bark.\n\n17 Congress had been barking quite loudly and vociferously\n\n18 for decades on this very issue. And then it adopted a\n\n19 statute that was interpreted by its own watchdog in a\n\n20 certain way, and then the barking stopped. And it seems\n\n21 to me this Court is really ignoring reality to not -- to\n\n22 not see that that has important weight.\n\n23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would be the\n\n24 consequences if we affirm? Your brief didn\u0027t list a\n\n25 great parade of horribles. It seems to me that our\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n16\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 system is quite capable of accommodating the\n\n2 Respondent\u0027s argument.

It said that these individuals under\n\n13 (a)(2) and (a)(3) need to be personally designated by\n\n14 the President. It cannot be delegated. That is the\n\n15 kind of responsibility that when Congress puts that in\n\n16 the President, this -- it\u0027s not surprising then that\n\n17 those folks should be able to serve while they are\n\n18 nominated because they have gotten not only a Senate\n\n19 confirmation or long-standing agency service, but the\n\n20 personal approval of the President.\n\n21 Counsel tried to distinguish the cases that\n\n22 we raised.
