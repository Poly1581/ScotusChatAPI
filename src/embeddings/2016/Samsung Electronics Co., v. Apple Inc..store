MR.\n\nFLETCHER: So we think that there\u0027d be\n\n7 two factual questions in a case where that\u0027s disputed.\n\n8 The first one would be what is the relevant article, and\n\n9 there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case.\n\n10 The second question, once the fact-finder\n\n11 identifies the relevant article, is the question that\n\n12 you asked, which is how much of the total profits from\n\n13 the device are attributable to the infringing article?\n\n14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\u0027s the first step,\n\n15 and how do you figure it out?\n\n16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he complete\n\n17 his answer to my question?\n\n18 MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on the\n\n19 second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a\n\n20 lot of detail because it hasn\u0027t been briefed in this\n\n21 case. This case sort of stopped at the first step. But\n\n22 we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that\n\n23 courts have handled other analogous questions, and I\n\n24 point to two areas of law where that\u0027s happened.\n\n25 The first is utility patent damages under\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n23\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the\n\n2 infringer\u0027s profits.

FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldon\n\n8 case that\u0027s cited on page 27 of our brief from this\n\n9 Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these\n\n10 problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion\n\n11 the portion -- the profits from a movie that are\n\n12 attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or\n\n13 the directors or other things. And they had experts who\n\n14 were familiar with the industry and who said the script\n\n15 is important but, really, a lot of the value and\n\n16 particularly for a movie like this comes from other\n\n17 things.\n\n18 And there were various expert testimonies\n\n19 that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up\n\n20 saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of\n\n21 the total profits from the movie, and this Court\n\n22 affirmed that award and said that\u0027s a reasonable\n\n23 approximation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"26","file_name":"Samsung Electronics Co., v.

In a\n\n13 case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing\n\n14 articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should\n\n15 be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find\n\n16 infringement, total profits are awarded on the article\n\n17 of manufacture to which the patented design was applied\n\n18 for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar\n\n19 or distinctive appearance.\n\n20 You may determine that the article of\n\n21 manufacture is the entire product or a distinct\n\n22 component of that product. In making that\n\n23 determination, you may consider, and this would depend\n\n24 on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would\n\n25 include the Solicitor General\u0027s, and there may be other\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n40\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 things. For example, most importantly the identity of\n\n2 what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers.\n\n3 Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers\n\n4 to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the\n\n5 patentee\u0027s product.\n\n6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\u0027m not","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"40","file_name":"Samsung Electronics Co., v.

MR.\n\nWAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\n\n22 that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\n\n23 total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\n\n24 to which the design has been applied. That is\n\n25 relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n46\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is\n\n2 the product that\u0027s sold. It is more complicated when\n\n3 the jury concludes that the relevant article of\n\n4 manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where\n\n5 customers could choose an array of cases in which to put\n\n6 the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out\n\n7 total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case.\n\n8 But the decided cases that I have seen have\n\n9 looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what\n\n10 were the direct costs associated with producing the\n\n11 relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on\n\n12 the piano as applied to that.\n\n13 And may I just add one other point which I\n\n14 think is still on track. The problem with that is that\n\n15 it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress\n\n16 was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design\n\n17 Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters\n\n18 and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only\n\n19 compensation was something that could be viewed as the\n\n20 cost of doing business, that is okay, you\u0027re going to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"47","file_name":"Samsung Electronics Co., v.

We tried at every juncture to get the correct\n\n15 rule of law adopted. And the district court said, I\n\n16 forbade apportionment.

should be instructed that the article of manufacture\n\n25 either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n56\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\n\n2 articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\n\n3 might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\n\n4 but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\n\n5 spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\n\n6 spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\n\n7 that\u0027s all right.\n\n8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\n\n9 showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\n\n10 case like this, Apple will say it\u0027s the whole phone.\n\n11 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\n\n12 you with the most important disagreement we have with\n\n13 the government and with Apple, the burden is on the\n\n14 plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\n\n15 the article of manufacture is.\n\n16 Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\n\n17 to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\n\n18 what the damages are are also always the plaintiff\u0027s\n\n19 burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\n\n20 Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you\n\n21 remand -- vacate and remand.\n\n22 Thank you very much, Your Honor.\n\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"58","file_name":"Samsung Electronics Co., v.
