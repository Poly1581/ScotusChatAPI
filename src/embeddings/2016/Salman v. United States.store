SHAPIRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 In case after case -- McNally, Skilling, and\n\n12 McDonald, to name just a few -- this Court has construed\n\n13 Federal criminal statutes narrowly to avoid serious\n\n14 separation of powers and vagueness problems.\n\n15 This case presents those same constitutional\n\n16 concerns, but to a far greater degree, because no\n\n17 statute defines the elements of the crime. The Court\n\n18 should limit this crime to its core, as it did in\n\n19 Skilling, and that core is the insider\u0027s abuse of\n\n20 confidential corporate information for personal profit.\n\n21 Unless and until Congress enacts a definition, the crime\n\n22 should be limited to trading by the insider or its\n\n23 functional equivalent -- equivalent where the insider\n\n24 tips another person in exchange for a financial benefit.\n\n25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose in this case the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n4","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Salman v.

And the reason for that is that the Court\n\n13 held that it would be a fraud to exploit the information\n\n14 for his personal trading profits because he had a duty\n\n15 to those shareholders and a duty to speak and either\n\n16 disclose or abstain from trading.\n\n17 With respect to the integrity of the\n\n18 markets, getting back to your question, Justice Kagan, I\n\n19 think that that is clearly a policy question, and it is\n\n20 a very complex policy question.

And the\n\n20 facts of Newman are actually inconsistent with the\n\n21 standard that the government purports to propose,\n\n22 because the government claims that it will insist that\n\n23 the insider has to have an intention that the tippee\n\n24 trade.

And the other -- the example of the other\n\n7 insider also illustrates that sometimes it\u0027s not so\n\n8 clear whether someone has a corporate purpose or a\n\n9 personal purpose, because sometimes purposes are mixed.\n\n10 In that instance, the insider was speaking with an\n\n11 analyst who was checking his financial model, and as the\n\n12 evidence in the case shows -- this happens every day in\n\n13 the markets -- the government argued that he was also\n\n14 seeking career advice from the other individual who was\n\n15 a college friend, but there\u0027s no indication there that\n\n16 he knew he was going to trade.\n\n17 And furthermore, the government\u0027s argument\n\n18 is completely inconsistent with Dirks. The facts of\n\n19 Dirks, and it was undisputed on the record, are that the\n\n20 insider secrets disclosed the information. He was\n\n21 seeking to expose a fraud, but he intended that Dirks\n\n22 would share the information with his institutional\n\n23 clients so that they could trade and drive the price of\n\n24 the stock down.
