Debt collector is defined\n\nin the Act as the most relevant here to include\n\nindividuals who regularly collect debts owed or due\n\nanother.\n\nWhen Respondent Santander was originally\n\nhired to collect Petitioners\u0027 defaulted car loans,\n\nthere\u0027s no question that it was collecting the debt owed\n\nor due another under anyone\u0027s interpretation of that\n\nterm. The question in this case is whether that changed\n\nwhen Santander purchased an assignment of that debt.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit held that it did,\n\nwrongly, based on its interpretation of the key phrase\n\n\"owed or due another,\" which is used twice in the\n\ndefinition of debt collector, once in the principal\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Henson v.

With the Court\u0027s indulgence, I would\n\nlike to walk through that exception. And it\u0027s found on\n\npage 4A of the appendix to the blue brief.\n\nAs I mentioned, this is an exception for\n\nsomebody who otherwise qualifies as a debt collector\n\nunder the main definition for somebody who is collecting\n\na debt owed or due another. And that same requirement\n\nis repeated at the beginning of Clause (F). It has to\n\nbe somebody -- any person collecting or attempting to\n\ncollect a debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due\n\nanother, and then it says to the extent such activity\n\nmeets one of four qualifications.\n\nAnd the one I want to focus on is the\n\nfourth, and that applies to somebody who\u0027s engaged in\n\nactivity concerning a debt obtained by such person as a\n\nsecured party in a commercial credit transaction\n\ninvolving the creditor.\n\nNow, I think the parties agree with the\n\nFTC\u0027s interpretation of this.

And with regard to the language of\n\nthe \"regularly collects\" provision, I don\u0027t think that\n\nPetitioners really dispute that ours is the most natural\n\ninterpretation of that provision.\n\nAs I understand Petitioners\u0027 arguments, both\n\nin their briefs and now at oral argument today, they are\n\nreally making two principle arguments. The first is\n\nthis argument concerning the exclusions; that our\n\ninterpretation somehow renders certain exclusions from\n\nthe definition of debt collector nonsensical.

And Mr. Russell really fixates on\n\nthis concept of assignment.\n\nBut as you pointed out and as Justice Alito\n\npointed out, assignment is neither here nor there with\n\nregard to this exclusion. The concept of assignment\n\nappears only once in the FDCPA, that is in the assignee\n\nexclusion to the creditor definition, which I think both\n\nsides acknowledge is not dispositive of the inquiry\n\nhere.\n\nI think that the dispositive consideration\n\nis whether the servicer in the context of\n\nClause (F)(iii) or the secured party in the context of\n\nClause (F)(iv) acquires complete ownership or acquires\n\nsomething less than that.\n\nAnd I think that when Congress used the word\n\n\"obtain\" in both of these provisions, it was\n\ncontemplating the full panoply of arrangements where an\n\nentity could obtain something less than full ownership.\n\nAnd so to move to Clause (F)(iii), and I\n\nthink the analysis is analogous under both Clauses,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"34","file_name":"Henson v.

And so\n\nif a servicer had legal title but not complete title,\n\nthe servicer would, of course, come within the\n\nexclusion.\n\nAnd so, again, we think that with regard to\n\nboth of these exclusions, we\u0027re really giving these\n\nexclusions their intended meaning, because Congress\n\nwanted to ensure that where you have a servicer or where\n\nyou have a secured party that engages in collection\n\nactivity when either of those entities has not acquired\n\nfull ownership, that there is an exemption from the\n\nstatute in the context of servicers.

The first is the hypothetical -- and these\n\nare both at page 4 of the reply brief -- of a statute\n\nthat refers to a person who regularly creates debts\n\ncreated by another. Now, of course, as we argue in our\n\nbrief, we believe that the grammatical way to express\n\nthat view would be to say a person who regularly\n\ncollects debts that had been created by another.\n\nBut even if you didn\u0027t agree with that, I\n\nthink that hypothetical is distinct in a very important\n\nway. The act of creation is a discrete act, and it\u0027s an\n\nact that, of necessity, has to have taken place in the\n\npast.

But what\n\nPetitioners are attempting to do is to inject a quite\n\ndifferent theory, both legally and factually, as to why\n\nwe satisfy that definition into this case.\n\nIf you take a look at the question presented\n\nin the petition, the question presented focuses on\n\nwhether a company -- and I\u0027m quoting from Roman numeral\n\nI, \"Whether a company that regularly attempts to collect\n\ndebts it purchased after the debts had fallen into\n\ndefault, is a debt collector subject to the act.\"\n\nPetitioners\u0027 alternative theory is that we\n\nsomehow fall within that definition because of our\n\nservicing activity. And in particular, Petitioners\n\npoint to one of our SEC filings for the proposition that\n\nwe engage in other servicing activity; namely, servicing\n\nactivity of other debts for other entities.\n\nNow, that\u0027s not within the scope of the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n45\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nquestion presented, and as Petitioners acknowledge in\n\ntheir reply brief, that argument was not made in the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"46","file_name":"Henson v.

of the petition, nor was that the argument that\n\nPetitioners made in the lower courts.\n\nIf you take a look at both the Fourth\n\nCircuit\u0027s opinion and the briefing in the Fourth Circuit\n\nand in the district court, I think that the most that\n\ncan be said about Petitioners argument is that they made\n\nan argument along the lines of what Justice Kagan\n\nsuggested. They made an argument that by virtue of the\n\nfact that we serviced the very debts at issue in this\n\ncase, that there would be something inequitable, as a\n\npolicy matter, about saying that by virtue of that\n\nservicing activity, we\u0027re now no longer within the scope\n\nof the statute.\n\nI think what Petitioners are trying to do\n\nhere, is quite different. They are attempting to make\n\nan argument that by virtue of, again, our other\n\nservicing activity, that is sufficient to bring us\n\nwithin the ambit of the definition. And there is no\n\nallegation in the complaint, which you can see for\n\nyourself in the Joint Appendix, to that effect, and that\n\nhas never been Petitioners\u0027 theory in this case.\n\nAnd I would make one parenthetical note\n\nabout that.

Under either the\n\nprincipal purpose definition, or the regularly collects\n\ndefinition, you certainly have to look at the entity\u0027s\n\noverall operations.\n\nAnd as we explain in our brief, the question\n\nof whether a certain type of activity is sufficient to\n\ngive rise to regular collection has been the subject of\n\nsome discussion in the lower courts. We think that the\n\nbetter view that this relies largely on district court\n\nopinions because there\u0027s very little circuit authority\n\non this, is that in assessing whether an entity\n\nregularly collects debts owed or due another, you have\n\nto look at those debts in relation to the entities\u0027\n\noverall collection activities and determine whether that\n\ncollection activity is a substantial part of the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nentities\u0027 overall collection activities.\n\nBut that is an issue that would have to be\n\nresolved if Petitioners had relied on this alternative","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"51","file_name":"Henson v.

And again, if you take a look at the\n\ntransaction at issue here, what Santander was doing was\n\nnot buying distressed debt on some secondary market.
