SWARNS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 Duane Buck was condemned to death after his\n\n11 own court appointed trial attorneys knowingly introduced\n\n12 an expert opinion that he was more likely to commit\n\n13 criminal acts of violence in the future because he is\n\n14 black. This evidence encouraged the sentencing jury to\n\n15 make its critical future dangerousness decision which\n\n16 was a prerequisite for a death sentence and the central\n\n17 disputed issue at sentencing based not on the individual\n\n18 facts and circumstances of Mr. Buck\u0027s crime or his life\n\n19 history, but instead based on a false and pernicious\n\n20 group-based stereotype.\n\n21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn\u0027t that expert say, I\n\n22 don\u0027t think he\u0027s a future -- I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to\n\n23 be a future danger?\n\n24 MS.

KELLER: Well, insofar as the\n\n3 extraordinary circumstances analysis under 60(b) has\n\n4 been performed, I believe the Fifth Circuit was correct\n\n5 in that it has to be an extraordinary circumstance\n\n6 justifying relief from the judgment. And when the facts\n\n7 of this case obviously have existed for over 20 years,\n\n8 there\u0027s been nothing new about raising that claim in a\n\n9 second rule 60(b) motion to reopen the judgment. And so\n\n10 in that sense, this is even further than Gonzalez v.\n\n11 Crosby where that was just a 60(b) motion. This is the\n\n12 second 60(b) motion.\n\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your\n\n14 arguments on the merits, but do they apply equally to\n\n15 the Certificate of Appealability? I mean, you argue\n\n16 that you should prevail on the merits.

The court also\n\n14 noted that death is different. And at the same time,\n\n15 the Fifth Circuit is provided substantial process. Now,\n\n16 insofar, though, as this Court were to -- if it were\n\n17 going to conclude in this case that a COA should have\n\n18 issued, it -- any such decision, I think, would be\n\n19 limited to the unique facts of this case.
