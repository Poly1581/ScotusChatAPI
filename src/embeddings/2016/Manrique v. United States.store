In either event, that single notice\n\n17 of appeal perfects appeal of all issues that arise\n\n18 within that judgment and sentence when it is fully\n\n19 completed.\n\n20 We know this in part because of the Court\u0027s\n\n21 decision in Dolan.

If we go down one by one each of the sections of\n\n14 4(b), each section leads to a single conclusion.

So a notice of\n\n19 appeal can\u0027t designate an order that has not yet been\n\n20 made.\n\n21 MR.

And then\n\n12 later on, you can appeal either the part that fills it\n\n13 in, or the whole thing. It seems to me that usually if\n\n14 things are -- they\u0027re either final or not, and if they\n\n15 are not, you can\u0027t appeal; and if they are, you can.\n\n16 MR.

That was a provisional sentence that was to\n\n20 be completed with the actual sentencing hearing much\n\n21 later down the road, up to -- up to six months down the\n\n22 road, than the time the initial appeal would have been\n\n23 allowed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I\u0027m not challenging\n\n3 your reading of the case, but, I mean, that\u0027s a very\n\n4 unusual type of approach when it comes to jurisdictional\n\n5 rules, you know, final enough, you know, and then you\n\n6 get other cases, are they final -- like this one: Is\n\n7 this final enough or not. It just seems to me we would\n\n8 be better served by a simple rule.\n\n9 And even the rule -- well, if you can do two\n\n10 different things, that means the court gave a notice of\n\n11 appeal from the original judgment and they don\u0027t know --\n\n12 they don\u0027t necessarily know if there\u0027s going to be\n\n13 anything more, right? The restitution may be\n\n14 insignificant enough that you don\u0027t feel it\u0027s worth\n\n15 adding that to the appeal issues, any number of things.\n\n16 So I don\u0027t see how they know should we hold onto this or\n\n17 not hold onto it.\n\n18 MR.

They were not concerned or troubled by anything\n\n19 that was still outstanding.\n\n20 The reason for that really was predicted by\n\n21 the Solicitor General\u0027s brief in Dolan itself. It said\n\n22 that in most cases we can expect that the court will\n\n23 resolve it either at sentencing or within 90 days, and\n\n24 that most appeals back then would take 12 months. Now\n\n25 they take 10.6 months.

And in\n\n7 the meantime, if there is to be a new trial, we have\n\n8 problems with witnesses being unavailable, the defendant\n\n9 often in custody during this time.

You rely heavily\n\n16 on 4(b)(2), but it doesn\u0027t even seem to apply by its\n\n17 terms.\n\n18 It says, \"Notice of appeal filed after the\n\n19 court announces a decision, sentence or order, but\n\n20 before the entry of judgment.\"\n\n21 And that would not seem to apply to a\n\n22 situation here. This wasn\u0027t before the entry of\n\n23 judgment, the appeal of the restitution part. It was --\n\n24 it was after.\n\n25 MR. RASHKIND: That is our argument, Your\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n17\n\n1 Honor, that it is. The words \"the judgment\" in 4(b)(2)\n\n2 are not the -- the interim judgment. It\u0027s speaking in\n\n3 terms as the court in rules normally do, to the\n\n4 completed final judgment.

What gives us the power\n\n3 to do this?\n\n4 MR. RASHKIND: The power is in the rules.\n\n5 The Court decided decades ago that the rules would tell\n\n6 lawyers how to proceed in litigation. The rules are to\n\n7 be clear.\n\n8 When, for example, one of the rules on the\n\n9 civil side made it possible for a lawyer to make a\n\n10 mistake by not filing a second notice of appeal,\n\n11 something the Court recognized in its Griggs decision,\n\n12 the rules drafters went right back and immediately\n\n13 changed that rule and said in their commentary it was\n\n14 designed to eliminate the trap for the unwary that the\n\n15 previous rule created. The rules are designed so that\n\n16 there is a fair administration of justice without great\n\n17 cost and delay, without confusion.\n\n18 These rules say that you must notice an\n\n19 appeal from a final judgment. That was done in this\n\n20 case. In fact, the final judgment in this case, and all\n\n21 cases like it, has this anomaly. The notice of appeal\n\n22 is at the same time timely and partially untimely.

I mean, the only thing\n\n12 that gives you pause in a case like this is just because\n\n13 usually, you only have to file one notice of appeal.\n\n14 You do get worried about, you know, traps for the unwary\n\n15 and a person who just won\u0027t understand that there\u0027s\n\n16 another stage in this process and needs to file a notice\n\n17 of appeal.\n\n18 As long as the Court is fulfilling its\n\n19 obligation of saying, okay, now, you know, if you have\n\n20 an objection to this, you need to file another notice of\n\n21 appeal, well, that solves the problem. But if the Court\n\n22 doesn\u0027t say it, it doesn\u0027t solve the problem.\n\n23 And apparently, that\u0027s what happened in this\n\n24 case. And Mr. Rashkind represents that his client\n\n25 didn\u0027t know of his opportunity to, or his need to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n30\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 appeal.\n\n2 MR.

the original notice of\n\n4 appeal should suffice to challenge a decision that\n\n5 hasn\u0027t yet been made.\n\n6 And keep in mind the nature of Petitioner\u0027s\n\n7 challenge here, which is not to the fact of restitution,\n\n8 which he acknowledges was mandatory under the statute.\n\n9 He objected to the amount of restitution, and\n\n10 specifically, to the sufficiency of the evidence that\n\n11 the government put forward at the hearing to justify the\n\n12 $4500 that was awarded in restitution. And there\u0027s\n\n13 simply no way that Petitioner at the time he filed his\n\n14 notice of appeal could have had any idea about the basis\n\n15 for that.\n\n16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The issue here\n\n17 strikes me as -- as somewhat similar to the issue that\n\n18 arises in the civil context with respect to attorneys\u0027\n\n19 fees.\n\n20 You have a judgment and you\u0027re entitled to\n\n21 attorneys\u0027 fees because you\u0027ve won, but of course they\n\n22 don\u0027t know what those are yet.

I -- I think you could change the rules,\n\n16 perhaps, to deal with that situation, but it would be a\n\n17 fairly radical change in the way that notices of appeal\n\n18 and jurisdiction normally work, because normally we\n\n19 think of a notice of appeal as transferring to the court\n\n20 of appeals\u0027 jurisdiction over all of the elements\n\n21 contained in the judgment that was identified. And\n\n22 instead you would be transferring on a prospective basis\n\n23 decisions that had yet to be made. And I think it would\n\n24 also, for the reasons that the Chief Justice identified,\n\n25 be for a court of appeals very confusing. Because\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n42\n\n1 remember that, in many cases, criminal defendants have a\n\n2 strong incentive to get their appeal up and going as\n\n3 soon as possible. That\u0027s especially true if you\u0027re a\n\n4 criminal defendant who\u0027s got a short prison term or you\n\n5 want to be let out on bail pending appeal.\n\n6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said -- I\u0027m not\n\n7 going to get the phrase right -- jurisdiction over all\n\n8 of the elements of the appeal, or something like that?\n\n9 MR. KEDEM: That\u0027s right. Contained in the\n\n10 judgment that you have appealed.\n\n11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

In other words, suppose I\u0027m a\n\n18 defendant and I miss my 14 days, I don\u0027t file a notice\n\n19 of appeal within that time.
