HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis Court should not expand Bivens\n\nfor the first time in 40 years.\n\nFirst, Bivens extensions clash with\n\nmodern precedent.  Bivens interpreted federal\n\ncourts\u0027 jurisdiction over federal questions as\n\nauthorizing courts to fashion new damages\n\nactions.  Decades of intervening cases reject\n\nthat premise and remove any doctrinal basis for\n\nBivens extensions.\n\nSecond, this Court has held that any\n\nreason to think Congress might doubt the\n\nefficacy or the necessity of a damages remedy\n\nbars new Bivens actions.  Abbasi and Hernandez\n\nmake respect for the separation of powers the\n\nkey consideration.  But the Constitution vests\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nCongress alone with the power to create damages\n\nactions.  Abbasi and Hernandez say courts must\n\npause if the judiciary isn\u0027t well suited to\n\nassess the systemic costs and benefits of a new\n\ndamages action. But courts are never equipped\n\nfor such predictive empirical judgments.\n\nAbbasi and Hernandez also rule out\n\nBivens extensions if Congress has extensively\n\nlegislated in an area. But Congress has\n\nextensively legislated about federal officer\n\nliability without allowing individual damages\n\nactions.\n\nThird, at the very least, this Court\n\nshould not expand Bivens to First Amendment\n\nretaliation claims or to Fourth Amendment claims","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Egbert v.

OF MICHAEL R.

At step 1 of Abbasi\u0027s framework,\n\nboth of Respondent\u0027s claims would require\n\nextending Bivens to new contexts for the first\n\ntime in 40 years, and at step 2, multiple\n\nspecial factors counsel hesitation against the\n\nCourt taking that momentous step.\n\nOn the First Amendment, this Court has\n\nexplained that retaliation claims are easy to\n\nallege and hard to disprove and that they have\n\nthe potential to chill federal officers\u0027\n\nperformance of important functions.  That is\n\nespecially true here, where Respondent seeks to\n\nimpose liability for Agent Egbert\u0027s giving of a\n\ntip to another agency suggesting further\n\ninvestigation.\n\nAnd on the Fourth Amendment,\n\nRespondent\u0027s claim is meaningfully different\n\nfrom the ones in Bivens in ways that bear\n\ndirectly on the separation of powers.

on the\n\nquestions that Ms. Harris was confronted with,\n\ndo you think that there is a meaningful\n\ndifference between Border Patrol agents and\n\nnarcotics agents?\n\nMR. HUSTON: I think that Border\n\nPatrol agents do present a new context, Your\n\nHonor, at step 1 of Abbasi, but I think whether\n\nspecial factors counsel hesitation and, thus,\n\nwhether a Bivens claim can go forward depends on\n\nwhat the Border Patrol agents are doing.\n\nSo I think this goes directly to the\n\nquestion that -- that Justice Barrett posed\n\nabout what about a situation where a federal\n\nofficer performs some duties that do implicate\n\nnational security and others that don\u0027t.\n\nWe do think that that makes a very\n\nimportant difference, and we think that the --\n\nthe facts here present a very clear and strong\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"21","file_name":"Egbert v.

No?\n\nThank you, counsel.\n\nMs. Ellsworth.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FELICIA H. ELLSWORTH\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMS. ELLSWORTH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nMr. Boule\u0027s Fourth Amendment claim is\n\nmaterially indistinguishable from Bivens itself.\n\nA federal law enforcement agent entered private\n\nproperty without a warrant and used excessive\n\nforce, just like the federal agents in Bivens,\n\nas the Court\u0027s questions have indicated.\n\nThe fact that the federal agent\n\ninquired about the visa status of Mr. Boule\u0027s\n\nguest in the process does not make this case any\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n42\n\nOfficial\n\ndifferent from the other instances of law\n\nenforcement overreach in the search-and-seizure\n\ncontext in which this Court has long recognized\n\nthat a Bivens remedy lies.\n\nAnd this case has none of the foreign\n\npolicy or extraterritoriality concerns that\n\nanimated the Court\u0027s decision in Hernandez.\n\nInstead, this is a case like the Court observed\n\nin -- in Abbasi, where Bivens has continuing\n\nforce and even necessity.\n\nMr. Boule\u0027s First Amendment claim\n\naddresses conduct that is similar to the conduct","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"36","file_name":"Egbert v.

ELLSWORTH:  If the Westfall -- if\n\nthe FTCA were sufficient to be an alternative\n\nremedy, first of all, that would have to -- that\n\nwould contravene this Court\u0027s guidance in\n\nCarlson and Malesko about the FTCA and Bivens\n\nmeaning to co-exist.\n\nBut the second point I would make is\n\nthe Westfall Act explicitly exempts Bivens\n\nactions.  That\u0027s what the Court said in Hui\n\nversus Castaneda, and the Westfall Act was\n\nenacted against the backdrop of this Court\u0027s\n\nBivens jurisprudence at least as it existed in\n\n1988, which was, respectfully, far broader than\n\nit is today.\n\nSo, to -- to the extent we can read\n\nanything into what Congress has done in the\n\nWestfall Act, I think it -- it certainly doesn\u0027t\n\ncounsel against a Bivens remedy in this case in\n\nthe Fourth Amendment context.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, if I\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\nunderstand you correctly, you disagree with the\n\nNinth Circuit at the first step, is that right?\n\nThe Ninth Circuit said this is a new\n\ncontext, and you say it is not a new context\n\nbecause the actions of the officers here are","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"54","file_name":"Egbert v.

ELLSWORTH:  Let me try and answer\n\nthat question in a few different ways.\n\nThe first is the -- what the Court\n\nwould be doing here were it to recognize --\n\naffirm the Ninth Circuit and recognize the\n\navailability of Bivens would be to -- to find\n\nthat this conduct falls within a cause of action\n\nthat the Court has already implied in Bivens in\n\nthe Fourth Amendment context, to go to Justice\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n81\n\nOfficial\n\nKagan\u0027s point.  So I don\u0027t think the -- the\n\nCourt would be involved in -- in that form of\n\nimplying a cause of action here because it would\n\nfit within the conduct of Bivens.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"72","file_name":"Egbert v.

And I think there really is a\n\ncontrast between our positions.\n\nAs perhaps the Chief\u0027s most recent\n\nquestion indicates, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s -- it\u0027s\n\nright to think that Congress would be looking at\n\nthe granular details of whether Agent Egbert\n\nshould have stopped someone, you know, 50 meters\n\nfrom the Smuggler\u0027s Inn or at the Smuggler\u0027s Inn\n\ndriveway or perhaps on the road up to the\n\nSmuggler\u0027s Inn.\n\nI think the question that this Court\u0027s\n\ncases have looked at -- and Hernandez is a\n\nparticularly good example -- is what is the type\n\nof conduct that the officer is engaged in?  It\u0027s\n\nnot, you know, Agent Mesa in Hernandez engaged\n\nin a purportedly unjustified cross-border\n\nkilling of a teenager.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"75","file_name":"Egbert v.
