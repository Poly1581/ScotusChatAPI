DREEBEN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case involves a fundamental\n\nquestion about the meaning of content-based\n\nregulation under the First Amendment.  The Fifth\n\nCircuit interpreted this Court\u0027s decision in\n\nReed to mean that any time that an officer must\n\nread a sign to apply the law, the law is\n\ncontent-based.\n\nThat holding is wrong and should be\n\nreversed.  A law is content-based on its face\n\nwhen the text of the law singles out specific\n\nsubject matter for differential treatment.  The\n\nlaw in Reed did that by distinguishing\n\nideological, political, and directional signs.\n\nA rule regulating off-premises\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nadvertising does not. The off-premises rule is\n\nan empty vessel that applies to all subjects and\n\ntopics. It turns on the relationship of a sign\n\nto its location, not the content of its message.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit\u0027s rigid rule does\n\nnot further First Amendment values.  Austin\u0027s\n\nlaw does not skew the marketplace for speech or\n\nsuppress any ideas.

does not skew the marketplace for speech or\n\nsuppress any ideas.\n\nBut the Fifth Circuit\u0027s\n\nrule would have untenable effects.  Many\n\nordinances can be applied only by looking at\n\nwhat a sign says.  Temporary event signs are a\n\nperfect example.  Strict scrutiny of such laws\n\nis unwarranted.\n\nNow Respondent offers a new theory,\n\narguing that any sign code provision tied to the\n\nfunction or purpose of speech is content-based\n\non its face.  But many neutral laws are tied to\n\nfunction.  Sign regulation is inherently\n\nfunctional.  Signs function to present\n\ninformation.  And the regulation of solicitation\n\nis based on the function of soliciting.\n\nSo long as these rules are\n\neven-handed, they are facially content-neutral.\n\nFirst Amendment review still applies, but the\n\nright standard is intermediate, not strict,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nscrutiny.

you have specific subject matter that\u0027s\n\ntargeted, you\u0027re in content-based land, and,\n\ntherefore, you go to strict scrutiny.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So I\u0027ll just close\n\nwith this comment:  The tension for me, just so\n\nyou know and -- and the other side knows, is the\n\ntension between this history and common\n\npractice, which means a lot to me, but I don\u0027t\n\nwant to water down what it means to be\n\ncontent-based.\n\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the risk of\n\nwatering down strict scrutiny comes from\n\nexpanding content-based to places where it\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\nnever gone.  I mean, Respondent will tell you\n\nthat his theory is based on function or purpose\n\nof a sign, which in Reed has that language.\n\nWe understand that language to be when\n\na jurisdiction regulates through function or\n\npurpose as a proxy for content, then you go to\n\nstrict scrutiny.

And that -- I just disagree\n\nwith that premise.

Court\n\nshould therefore apply strict scrutiny.\n\nUnder any standard of review, however,\n\nthis is an easy case.\n\nA through line of this\n\nCourt\u0027s First Amendment cases is that whatever\n\nthe standard of review, a regulatory distinction\n\nbetween different types of speech has to bear\n\nsome relation to the governmental interest\n\nasserted.\n\nHere, the challenged restriction,\n\nAustin\u0027s prohibition on the digitization of the\n\nsmall number of off-premises signs, flunks any\n\nstandard of review. It verges on the irrational\n\nfor Austin to permit digital on-premises signs\n\nwithout any limitation but to prohibit the\n\ndigitization of the small number of\n\ngrandfathered off-premises signs.\n\nThat differential treatment bears no\n\nrelation to Austin\u0027s asserted interests in\n\nsafety and aesthetics, and Austin presented no\n\nevidence at trial to support it.\n\nAll that the Court need do here is to\n\nhold that the digitization ban is invalid.\n\nOther restrictions based on similar on- and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial\n\noff-premises sign distinctions may well satisfy\n\nstrict scrutiny.\n\nAnd numerous jurisdictions have\n\nalready modified their definitions in the wake\n\nof Reed to render them content-neutral.

It covers a\n\nrelatively limited area, the area within 660\n\nfeet of a covered federal highway.  It excludes\n\nareas that are zoned in particular ways.\n\nThe City of Austin\u0027s ordinance, the\n\nordinance at issue here, by contrast, is quite\n\nbroad. And, again, all we\u0027re talking about\n\ntoday is the digitization ban.

part of the reason why\n\nthat\u0027s true is that many states have state laws\n\nthat simply track the definitional provisions of\n\nthe Highway Beautification Act, so I don\u0027t mean\n\nto minimize the fact that there are many\n\njurisdictions that have laws that draw these\n\ndistinctions.\n\nI would just make two points.  The\n\nfirst is that, as I said in response to the\n\nChief Justice, the way that the strict scrutiny\n\nanalysis would operate is going to depend on the\n\ntype of regulation at issue.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n80\n\nOfficial\n\nAgain, it\u0027s -- it\u0027s very nice to sort\n\nof discuss the definition of on-premises and\n\noff-premises signs in isolation, but, of course,\n\nthe real question is, what restrictions or\n\nregulations flow from that definition?\n\nAnd the analysis for a law like the\n\nHighway Beautification Act, which permits\n\non-premises signs but prohibits off-premises\n\nsigns, is, I would submit, potentially different\n\nfrom the analysis on the digitization ban.\n\nWhat makes this such an odd case is\n\nthat Austin permitted a small number of\n\noff-premises signs to remain and yet forbade the\n\nowners of those signs from doing what the owners\n\nof thousands of signs in Austin have been\n\npermitted to do, which is to convert them to\n\ndigital signs, which enables the owners of those\n\nsigns to display many more messages and to do\n\nthat much more efficiently.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"71","file_name":"Austin v.

SHANMUGAM:  I -- I -- I grant you,\n\nJustice Kagan, that in the hypothetical\n\ninvolving religious speech, there\u0027s a much\n\nstronger sense that something nefarious is going\n\non, that the government in question is targeting\n\nreligious speech and is singling out a\n\nparticular type of subject matter.\n\nBut, in some sense, the whole point of\n\nthe framework that this Court established in\n\nReed -- and I don\u0027t think it was inconsistent\n\nwith this Court\u0027s past precedents -- was a\n\nframework that looked first to the face of the\n\nregulation and, only after that, to the purpose\n\nof the regulation.\n\nAnd the Court made clear that even in\n\ncases where it might seem as if a regulation is\n\nbenign or reasonable, the Court still has to\n\ntake that first step and determine whether or\n\nnot the distinction is content-based on its\n\nface.\n\nAnd as I indicated to Justice Gorsuch,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n--\n\n91\n\nOfficial\n\nI do think that there is a sense in which a\n\nregulation like this is distortive. It could\n\nhave been designed to favor local businesses.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"80","file_name":"Austin v.

In many of those\n\nhypotheticals, what you\u0027re doing is really\n\ndefining a medium of speech.  That was true, for\n\ninstance, in Taxpayers for Vincent, where the\n\nCourt analyzed temporary signs as itself a\n\nmedium.\n\nAnd that may be possible with regard\n\nto categories such as directional signs\n\ndepending on how the category is defined.

But the reality is\n\nthat jurisdictions have been coming into\n\nconformity with this Court\u0027s decision in Reed.\n\nThere isn\u0027t an avalanche of litigation about\n\nthis issue.\n\nAnd I do think that some regulations\n\nthat distinguish between on-premises and\n\noff-premises signs, including potentially the\n\nHighway Beautification Act, are going to survive\n\nstrict scrutiny.

of all, Justice Thomas, in\n\nresponse to your question to me, the \"read the\n\nsign\" language appears in the Fifth Circuit\u0027s\n\nopinion at pages 14a and 19a of the Petition\n\nAppendix.  That\u0027s the test that the Court\n\napplied to identify something as facially\n\ncontent-based.\n\nSecond, Respondent invited this Court\n\nto read the record to determine what Austin said\n\nin the district court.  I invite the Court to\n\nread the record on what Austin argued in the\n\ndistrict court and on appeal.\n\nAustin did not appeal the intermediate\n\nscrutiny holding of the district court.  Its\n\nsole appeal is on the theory that strict\n\nscrutiny applied because the law is\n\ncontent-based by virtue of its distinction\n\nbetween on-premises and off-premises\n\nadvertising.\n\nSo I think the intermediate scrutiny\n\nquestion is not here and it\u0027s for the Fifth\n\nCircuit to decide whether it\u0027s waived.\n\nAnd then, finally, Justice Thomas,\n\nyour question about commercial speech and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n99\n\nOfficial\n\nwhether Respondents\u0027 billboards could be\n\nregulated as such, Respondents said that the\n\nquestion presented is about the facial validity\n\nof the statute under strict scrutiny.\n\nAnd that is correct.
