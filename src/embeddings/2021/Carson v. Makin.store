BINDAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nMaine\u0027s sectarian exclusion\n\ndiscriminates based on religion. Like all\n\ndiscrimination based on religion, it should be\n\nsubjected to strict scrutiny and held\n\nunconstitutional, unless Maine can show that it\n\nis necessary to achieve a compelling government\n\ninterest.\n\nMaine cannot make such a showing, and\n\nthe First Circuit never held that it could.\n\nInstead, the First Circuit held that there are\n\ntwo kinds of religious discrimination, the bad\n\nkind and the good kind.\n\nThe First Circuit recognized that\n\nMaine cannot discriminate against students or\n\nschools because they are religious, but it held\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nthe state is perfectly free to discriminate\n\nagainst students or schools because they do\n\nreligious things, such as teach or receive\n\ninstruction in religion.\n\nThe First Circuit was wrong.\n\nReligious discrimination is religious\n\ndiscrimination, and unless it can survive strict\n\nscrutiny, it is unconstitutional.\n\nThe First Circuit\u0027s refusal to apply\n\nstrict scrutiny based on a supposed status use\n\ndistinction was baseless.

That is, there are a lot of\n\ncircumstances in which the government decides to\n\nfund or subsidize activities that it believes to\n\nbe in the public interest.\n\nAnd the general rule is, as long as\n\nyou are prepared to do those things, you\u0027re\n\nentitled to the funding whether you\u0027re religious\n\nor not. And if we said that the person who did\n\nthose things with a religious reason in mind is\n\ngoing to be treated differently from the person\n\nwho did them with purely secular motivations,\n\nthat would be problematic.\n\nAnd to -- to take your hypothetical\n\nand -- and compare it to a situation in the\n\npublic schools, as Mr. Taub was pointing out,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n109\n\nOfficial\n\npublic schools attempt to teach virtues like\n\nhonesty, trustworthiness, kindness,\n\nconsideration for those less fortunate, and,\n\ncertainly, those are essentially secular values.\n\nThey certainly correspond to values that many\n\npeople hold as a matter of religious conviction.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"98","file_name":"Carson v.
