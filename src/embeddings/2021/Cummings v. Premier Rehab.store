So it seems to me either\n\nnobody was seeking emotional distress damages\n\nand then suddenly people started doing it and it\n\ncame up, or, you know, as -- as Petitioners told\n\nthe story, that everybody assumed that they were\n\navailable, and then, by when Sheely came around,\n\nsomebody finally thought to challenge it.\n\nSo why is it that this just came up in\n\nthe Eleventh Circuit case before and then, you\n\nknow, now in this case before us?  Everybody\n\nseemed to be on notice these cases were being\n\ndecided and damages being awarded.  No one\n\ncomplained.\n\nMR.

suit and went in\n\nthat direction.  But I don\u0027t think that it is\n\ntrue that it has just been assumed for 40 years,\n\n40-plus years, since the enactment of Title VI,\n\nthat emotional distress damages are available.\n\nIndeed, of the four cases that came to\n\nthis Court involving allegedly emotional\n\ndistress damages, three of those cases were\n\ncases involving pain and suffering.  And as we\n\npoint out in our brief, the analysis for\n\npain-and-suffering damages might be somewhat\n\ndifferent because there\u0027s a somewhat more\n\nsubstantial basis of contract law permitting\n\nthose damages.\n\nAnd so, again, I don\u0027t think that the\n\nlaw on the federal level was settled, and,\n\nagain, I think that the law as a matter of\n\ncontract law was certainly not settled, and the\n\nbest evidence of that is that I think all of the\n\ntreatises, while certainly recognizing that some\n\nstate courts have recognized exceptions --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n67\n\nOfficial\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  What\u0027s the one --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"59","file_name":"Cummings v.

Those are statutes with pretty\n\nbroad language.  The Fair Housing Act, for\n\ninstance, provides for actual damages, and\n\ncourts have construed that to include emotional\n\ndistress damages.\n\nThe second category are the\n\nantidiscrimination statutes that don\u0027t permit\n\nemotional distress damages at all.  And that\n\ncategory includes some pretty important\n\nstatutes.  I would be hard-pressed to identify a\n\nmore important one than Title II of the Civil\n\nRights Act, which is, of course, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n73\n\nOfficial\n\nfoundational provision that prohibits\n\ndiscrimination by private actors in the\n\nprovision of -- of public accommodation.  No\n\nemotional distress damages under that statute.\n\nThe same is true with regard to Title III of the\n\nADA, the ADEA, and other statutes.\n\nNow Title VII is, I think, perhaps the\n\nmost significant example because, of course,\n\nTitle VII when it was first enacted did not\n\nprovide for compensatory damages at all, and\n\nwhen Congress amended it in the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1991, Congress did so very carefully.\n\nIt imposed caps, including some quite\n\nstrict caps particularly with regard to small\n\nemployers, on the availability not just of\n\nemotional distress damages but also punitive\n\ndamages and other forms of non-economic damages\n\nmore generally.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"65","file_name":"Cummings v.

nonetheless, there are plenty of\n\nexamples of emotional distress damages running\n\ninto the seven figures.\n\nAnd while those awards\n\ncan be remitted, the standard for remittitur,\n\nconsistent with the Seventh Amendment, is quite\n\na high one. It is that the award shocks the\n\nconscience.\n\nAnd so, yes, of course, if this Court\n\nwere to permit these sorts of damages, the Court\n\ncould say to lower courts in an admonishing way:\n\nLook to Title VII.  That might provide some\n\nguidance.\n\nBut that just points up the\n\nquintessentially legislative nature of this\n\nwhole undertaking, particularly given that in\n\nTitle VII, what triggers the various caps is the\n\nsize of the employer.  That\u0027s obviously not a\n\nconsideration that would comfortably fall within\n\nthe traditional judicial task of remittitur.\n\nAnd yet, it reflects the fact that Congress made\n\nthe judgment that it wanted to provide a greater\n\ndegree of protection to small employers.\n\nAnd, again, that just illustrates that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n78\n\nOfficial\n\nif, in fact, emotional distress damages are to\n\nbe made available here, that is a matter for\n\nCongress to address in the first instance.\n\nAnd I think the Court can have some\n\ndegree of comfort that, if the Court were not to\n\npermit emotional distress damages here, it would\n\nnot be going further than Congress has in other\n\nstatutes.\n\nQuite to the contrary, what the Court","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"69","file_name":"Cummings v.
