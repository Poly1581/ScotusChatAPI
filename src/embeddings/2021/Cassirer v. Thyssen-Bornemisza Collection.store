Absolutely, Justice\n\nBreyer, and that\u0027s exactly where we think those\n\nprinciples we lay out at pages 21 through 22 of\n\nour brief would come in.  So how that would be\n\nanalyzed is, does that law represent\n\nMassachusetts creating foreign policy in a way\n\nthat is preempted either by something specific\n\nor some sort of field preemption?  And it would\n\nbe very much the Garamendi-Zschernig line of\n\ncases, and it would apply the same way to a\n\nchoice-of-law rule.\n\nBecause this is a choice-of-law rule,\n\nthere\u0027s also the additional layer that there\n\nwould be the due process type of analysis if\n\nthat choice-of-law rule was used to apply\n\nMassachusetts law to something that doesn\u0027t\n\nhave a sufficient connection.  So you have that\n\nadditional check.  But just in the same way\n\nthat you would apply that to a substantive rule\n\ndown the line in an FSIA case, you would apply\n\nit here.\n\nAnd -- and one other point on that is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n27\n\nOfficial\n\na lot of these foreign policy types of\n\nconsiderations could come up in a case against\n\na private entity as well.
