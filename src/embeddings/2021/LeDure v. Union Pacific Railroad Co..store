Frederick.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nIn 1904, this Court held in Johnson\n\nversus Southern Pacific that a motionless dining\n\ncar was in use when a worker\u0027s hand was crushed\n\nwhile he was trying to couple the car with a\n\nlocomotive.  That case construed \"use\" under the\n\nSafety Appliance Act of 1893.  In 1911, Congress\n\nincorporated the exact same statutory language\n\nin the first version of what became the\n\nLocomotive Inspection Act.\n\nIn Brady, this Court held that a\n\nmotionless car was still in use when an\n\ninspector was injured.

And 54a\n\nunder FELA\u0027s 45 U.S.C. says that the regulations\n\nare to be treated as statutes for purposes of\n\nFELA protection.\n\nHere, the basic problem is the\n\nforeseeability of the risk.  And I would submit\n\nthat one of the challenges in just bringing a\n\nnegligence claim in this circumstance is that\n\nthe UP, Union Pacific, had just reacquired\n\ncustody over this particular locomotive.  It had\n\nnot been inspected in a number of days. That\n\ninspection report is in the Joint Appendix.\n\nAnd so the question of where this\n\nparticular slipping hazard arose makes a\n\nnegligence case particularly hard because one\n\ncan\u0027t identify where the breach of the duty\n\noccurred.

does one call for\n\nstrict liability and the other doesn\u0027t?\n\nAnd you gave a partial answer, I\n\nthought, earlier, which was the whole purpose of\n\nthese acts is to protect railroad workers,\n\ncorrect?\n\nMR. FREDERICK:  Yes.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so is there a\n\ndifference between the railroad workers who are\n\nworking on this dead locomotive to -- to be part\n\nof the hauling mechanism and the guys who are in\n\nthe shop or who are walking around the -- the\n\nstorage yard -- I think that\u0027s Justice Alito\u0027s\n\nquestion -- what\u0027s the difference that would\n\ngive strict liability coverage for workers when\n\nin your definition of service but not when it\u0027s\n\nin the repair shop or on the side motionless?\n\nMR.

just to\n\nfollow up on what I see as the tension in this\n\ncase and get your thoughts about how to resolve\n\nit, because I think the questions have\n\nillustrated that if we were just looking at use,\n\nhow we normally think of the word \"in use,\" that\n\nyou would have a problem, in part because it\u0027s\n\nnot moving.  Of course, Congress in 1924 took\n\nout moving, so that helps you.\n\nSo I think just the ordinary\n\nunderstanding of \"use\" is not great for you, as\n\nthe hypotheticals have illustrated.\n\nWhat helps you is the precedent of the\n\nSAA cases, which basically said that\u0027s not the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\nway the term is being used in these statutes.\n\nAnd I think what also helps you is the point\n\nthat most of the injuries on locomotives are\n\nwhen they\u0027re stationary, because otherwise we\u0027d\n\nbe gutting the statute.\n\nBut the question then becomes, why\n\ntake the SAA precedent, which helps you\n\ntremendously, and bring it into the LIA when, as\n\na lot of the questions have illustrated, the LIA\n\nhas a different focus?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"31","file_name":"LeDure v.

So, obviously, if the\n\nlocomotive has never been put into service in\n\nthe first place, then it isn\u0027t in use.

And the key\n\nthings that they might do are moving it to a\n\ncontrolled environment like a repair shop, where\n\nyou just don\u0027t have the same risks of an exposed\n\nrailroad yard, where you have trains moving\n\neverywhere, you have people going everywhere.\n\nSo you\u0027ve put it in a controlled environment\n\nwhere the only people interacting with it are\n\npeople who are expecting to be dealing with a\n\ndefective locomotive.  Or you\u0027ve done something\n\nto make sure that there is no way that somebody\n\nis going -- an employee is just going to hop on\n\nthat train and turn it on or move it.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"41","file_name":"LeDure v.

But the concern there is that\n\nCongress wants to create an incentive to take\n\ndefective locomotives off the line, right?  So\n\nto take them where they\u0027re going to cause --\n\neven if they do cause a potential problem, it\u0027s\n\nnot going to have the massive consequences that\n\nit would have if it\u0027s in a railyard.\n\nI mean, you think about, if a fuel\n\ntank explodes in a railyard, there\u0027s lots of\n\nother fuel tanks right nearby.  There\u0027s lots of\n\nother moving trains.\n\nSo there\u0027s this -- what -- what FRA\n\nsees is, if you -- if a carrier has done\n\nsomething to remove that locomotive to a\n\ncontrolled environment where that kind of risk\n\nisn\u0027t around, then there doesn\u0027t need to be the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial\n\nsort of \"negligence\" per se regime.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  And what -- what is","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"48","file_name":"LeDure v.

And\n\nthey -- in that -- in the provision of the SAA,\n\nthey created a safe harbor, a regulatory safe\n\nharbor, but -- but liability continued to apply.\n\nSo I think you have to look at that\n\nsafe harbor provision, which makes clear that\n\nCongress believed that a rail vehicle continues\n\nto be in use even when it is being hauled to a\n\nplace of repair.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBreyer, anything further?\n\nJustice Alito?\n\nJustice Sotomayor?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I\u0027m -- I\n\nunderstand that there\u0027s a safety gap if we apply\n\na different meaning to \"use\" for locomotives and\n\ntender from railroad cars.\n\nIs there any other reason?  It does\n\nseem, like, illogical that a railroad car\n\nsitting attached to the locomotive on the side\n\nwaiting for 15 minutes to get a spot into the\n\nrotation, that that\u0027s going to be treated\n\ndifferently.\n\nI think, under your client\u0027s theory,\n\nthe locomotive, while it\u0027s moving on that train\n\nthat\u0027s going from station to station, wouldn\u0027t\n\nbe covered.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"55","file_name":"LeDure v.

BALLENGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nIt seems to me that Petitioner and the\n\ngovernment are just rewriting the statute that\n\nCongress wrote. All of this about draining\n\nfluids and unhooking batteries isn\u0027t in the\n\nstatute.  I don\u0027t even think it\u0027s in the\n\nregulations.  I\u0027ve never heard it before.  It --\n\nit appears to be argument of counsel about what\n\nall of this should mean.  Union Pacific has\n\ncertainly never enlightened me that taking a --\n\na locomotive out of use requires that you\n\ndisconnect the battery and drain the fluids.\n\nNow, as a matter of plain meaning, one\n\nuses a locomotive to move railcars.  The\n\noriginal language of the statute made that\n\ncrystal clear by prohibiting the use of\n\nlocomotives in moving interstate or foreign\n\ntraffic if they were unsafe to operate in active\n\nservice.  And that active meaning is confirmed","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"62","file_name":"LeDure v.
