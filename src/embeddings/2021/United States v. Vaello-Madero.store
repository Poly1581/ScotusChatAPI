Puerto Rico\u0027s residents and\n\nemployers contribute to federal unemployment\n\ninsurance and to the Social Security and\n\nMedicare trust funds, and they receive benefits\n\nfrom those programs, but Congress has expressly\n\nexempted them from the obligations to pay many\n\nforms of federal taxes, including federal income\n\ntax in most instances, excise taxes, gift taxes,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nand estate taxes, which means that much of the\n\nrevenue that would have flowed into the federal\n\ntreasury can instead be tapped by territorial\n\ngovernment, which therefore has greater leeway\n\nto make different fiscal or economic choices\n\nconsistent with its distinctive status as a\n\nself-governing commonwealth.\n\nCongress could reasonably take those\n\nconsiderations into account when deciding that\n\nPuerto Rico\u0027s residents would receive some\n\nfederal benefits but not others.

But the fact\n\nthat Puerto Rico and other current territories\n\nhave uncertain future status vis-α-vis the\n\nUnited States is one thing that we think\n\npromotes the idea that Congress must necessarily\n\ntake into account that, among other things, when\n\nit is deciding whether to deal differently with\n\nterritories.\n\nSo Puerto Rico may be on its way to\n\nstatehood.  It may be on its way to\n\nindependence.  It may be on its way to some\n\nother status.\n\nBut those are -- that is relevant to\n\nCongress being able to continue to calibrate the\n\ndegree of relationship between the federal and\n\nterritorial polities and economies and FISCs.\n\nAnd so that\u0027s another reason why being\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"59","file_name":"United States v.

And we don\u0027t have a\n\nquarrel about that.\n\nThe only question is whether it could\n\nbe rational for Congress to have taken into\n\naccount other considerations and decided in this\n\ninstance that there was a basis for drawing a\n\ndifferent line with respect to Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd unless and until Congress alters\n\nPuerto Rico\u0027s distinct tax treatment, which\n\nRespondent and his amici have pointedly not said\n\nthat it is required to do, we think there is a\n\nplausible, rational, and non-invidious basis for\n\nPuerto Rico\u0027s residents to be excluded from SSI.\n\nWe urge the Court to reverse the\n\njudgment of the court of appeals.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel, counsel.  The case is submitted.\n\n(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case\n\nwas submitted.)\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\nOfficial\n\n71\n\n$ action [2] 49:23 53:19 answer [1] 27:7 away [2] 14:22 27:15 69:2\n\n$2 [1] 39:25 \nacts [1] 47:3\n\nactually [7] 19:10 21:3 40:\n\nanswered [2] 33:19,22\n\nanswers [2] 27:19 65:10 \nB bites [1] 24:11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"61","file_name":"United States v.
