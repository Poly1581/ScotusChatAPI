Those\n\nrequirements are, in short, the paradigmatic\n\nexample of a health and safety measure.\n\nSecond, the Secretary\u0027s decision was\n\nthoroughly explained and supported by the\n\nrecord.

Secretary claim -- the Secretary\u0027s\n\nclaim of authority to impose this mandate is\n\nexpansive, unprecedented, and unlawful for two\n\nprincipal reasons.\n\nFirst, the Secretary believes a series\n\nof vague catch-all provisions scattered\n\nthroughout the Social Security Act authorize\n\nthis sweeping mandate.  But the relevant text,\n\nstructure, and context say otherwise.\n\nFor example, the Secretary ignores\n\neight provisions that precede the catch-all\n\nprime -- provision he primarily invokes, all of\n\nwhich are materially unlike a permanent medical\n\nprocedure that cannot be undone after a shift\n\nis over.  Exceedingly clear language is\n\nrequired here because the mandate regulates\n\nmatters that have traditionally been within the\n\nprovince of the states.\n\nSecond, the rule is arbitrary and\n\ncapricious under the APA.
