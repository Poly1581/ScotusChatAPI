In this non-adversarial system,\n\nveterans enjoy distinct procedural protections,\n\nand review of otherwise final decisions for\n\nClear and Unmistakable Error, or CUE, is one of\n\nthose unique protections.  It prevents the\n\nagency\u0027s obvious errors from depriving veterans\n\nof the benefits to which their service entitles\n\nthem.\n\nThere is no dispute that a clear and\n\nunmistakable error has occurred when VA\n\nadjudicators misapply the terms of a plain\n\nstatute.

First, we\n\nhave to assume that Congress adopted words from\n\na regulation that it didn\u0027t choose to adopt. It\n\ntook some but not all, and we have to take your\n\npresumption that that was just shorthand and all\n\nthe rest came with it.\n\nAnd then, second, we have to, I think,\n\nunderstand the regulation about changes in\n\ninterpretation of law or changes in law to\n\nencompass judicial interpretations.\n\nAnd what do we do with Professor\n\nMascott\u0027s amicus brief, for example, in which\n\nshe quite rightly points out that we don\u0027t\n\nnormally think of judicial interpretations as\n\nchanges in the law?  In fact, in Rivers, we said\n\nit\u0027s not accurate to say that a change in the\n\nlaw -- that a judicial interpretation of\n\nCongress\u0027s statute amounts to a change in the\n\nlaw that previously prevailed?

Of course, direct review was not\n\navailable to Mr. George nor to any veteran until\n\n1988. There are many veterans who received\n\nclearly erroneous decisions and did not have the\n\nability to challenge those at the time.\n\nSecond, in speaking about supplemental\n\nclaims, there was a suggestion that one could\n\nbring such a claim with cumulative evidence or\n\nwith a legal error.  Neither of those is\n\ncorrect.  It is available only for new and\n\nrelevant evidence, formally known as new and\n\nmaterial evidence.  So -- so I think that\u0027s just\n\na mischaracterization of that form of relief.\n\nAnd, third, in the -- the Mitchael\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"76","file_name":"George v.
