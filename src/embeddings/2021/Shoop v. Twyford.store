are two problems with that.  The\n\nfirst is that the discovery rules that they draw\n\nanalogies to are not actually traditional writs.\n\nAnd you need to find some traditional writ to\n\nwhich this is analogous.\n\nBotsford, this Court\u0027s decision in\n\nBotsford makes absolutely crystal-clear that\n\ncourts have no sort of freestanding common law\n\nauthority to invent new discovery methods.  So\n\nthere was no traditional writ that allowed that.\n\nWhat\u0027s more is that even if the\n\ndiscovery rules provided the relevant usages and\n\nprinciples, the order here isn\u0027t agreeable to\n\nthose usages and principles.

REAVES: So a couple of points on\n\nthat, Justice Thomas.\n\nFirst of all, I think I\u0027d urge the\n\nCourt in this particular case to take the sort\n\nof approach that it took in Harris, where, when\n\nin a similar situation, when determining whether\n\na 2254 -- 2255, excuse me, petitioner could\n\nengage in discovery, and there weren\u0027t any\n\napplicable discovery provisions to 2255 at that\n\npoint in time, the Court looked to the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure.\n\nAnd I think that that is consistent\n\nwith this Court\u0027s general approach in this sort\n\nof situation.  It\u0027s -- the Court\u0027s been fairly\n\nlimited when it finds something blocked by\n\nexisting statutory law and has only done so in a\n\ncouple of situations that I\u0027d be happy to\n\nelaborate on.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Actually, what I\u0027d\n\nlike you to elaborate on just a bit, your -- the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"20","file_name":"Shoop v.

It resolves an\n\nissue completely separate from the merits.\n\nIt\u0027s separate because it\u0027s almost an\n\nevidentiary consideration under the good cause\n\nstandard as to whether this particular order\n\nshould issue.  And it\u0027s important because the\n\nstate does have interests like the President had\n\nin Nixon in running its prisons, imposing\n\nlawful -- presumptively lawful sentences without\n\nundue federal influence -- interference, and\n\navoiding the risks inherent in prisoner\n\ntransport.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS: So how would you\n\ndistinguish this, though, from any other\n\ndiscovery order?\n\nMS.

And,\n\nby the way, there are other methods of\n\nappealing.  You have 1292(b), not perfect, but\n\nit\u0027s there.

Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I just wanted to\n\nfollow up, Ms. Reaves, on Justice Thomas\u0027s first\n\nquestion. So, if there\u0027s no common law analogue\n\nand no specific statutory authorization, in the\n\nend, it seems to be a policy judgment of sorts,\n\nhow much we think we should analogize to other\n\nrules or what have you, as you point out.\n\nIf it is in the end a policy judgment,\n\nthe other side says leave it to Congress or the\n\nrules committees given the public safety issues\n\ninvolved, I just wanted you to respond to that.\n\nAnd maybe also tell me what should\n\ninform that policy judgment if we\u0027re making it.\n\nIs it just the benefits, fairness in individual\n\ncases outweigh the costs, even though you don\u0027t\n\nthink that they do in this particular case?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"33","file_name":"Shoop v.

REAVES: So I think it\u0027s important\n\nto start from the fact that the All Writs Act is\n\nalways fulfilling a gap-filling role and it\n\nalways comes into play when a statute doesn\u0027t\n\ndirectly cover a situation, but there is some\n\ntype of analogue.\n\nAnd, obviously, here, we think that\n\nthe appropriate analogues to look at are these\n\nfederal rules we\u0027ve identified.  They don\u0027t\n\ndirectly cover, but they do come in through Rule\n\n6 in appropriate situations, and that\u0027s what the\n\nCourt should be looking at.\n\nAs far as what the Court -- whether\n\nthe Court should feel uncomfortable here in this\n\nparticular case because of policy\n\nconsiderations, I think that that isn\u0027t quite\n\nthe role for the Court to play here.  I think\n\nthe Court has to ask, is there a gap that we can\n\nfill and whether the -- the components of the\n\nAll Writs Act are, in fact, met here.\n\nAnd I think that the Court should look\n\nat analogous cases again like Harris.  You know,\n\nthe Court there, discovery rules at that point\n\nin time didn\u0027t apply to 2255 cases, but the\n\nCourt said that it could still engage in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"34","file_name":"Shoop v.

FLOWERS: Thank you, Your Honors.\n\nI want to briefly make, if I can, three points.\n\nThe first is that in terms of the\n\ndifficulty of applying the collateral order\n\ndoctrine, appellate courts for decades have had\n\nno trouble doing so to these -- to these cases,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial\n\nin large part because most transportation orders\n\nare never appealed.  There\u0027s not actually a\n\nproblem.  It\u0027s when the state is concerned with\n\ninterference with its affairs that it does\n\nappeal.\n\nTo the extent the Court\u0027s worried\n\nabout that, though, it\u0027s free here to announce\n\nthe standards and remand for the Sixth Circuit\n\nto consider the still-never-resolved mandamus\n\nrequest through the application of the proper\n\nstandards.\n\nSecond, you must have a traditional\n\nanalogue in order to invoke the All Writs Act.\n\nIt is not a freestanding power to make up ad hoc\n\nwrits. The Court\u0027s been very clear about that.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"54","file_name":"Shoop v.
