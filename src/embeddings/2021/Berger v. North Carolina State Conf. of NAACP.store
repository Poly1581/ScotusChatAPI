Well, you\n\nsaid that they could kick the Attorney General\n\nout anytime.  And I\u0027m not saying, like, as a\n\nmatter of general principle that the Attorney\n\nGeneral is not the one who typically represent\n\nthe state in court. But, obviously, there\u0027s\n\nbeen a lot of back and forth, and the\n\nlegislature has passed laws related to this\n\nspecific litigation.\n\nSo I\u0027m just saying, would that matter\n\nat all?

THEODORE:  Well, the state\n\nlegislature -- the Petitioners here have said in\n\ntheir cert petition they don\u0027t represent the\n\nlegislature, they only represent the state,\n\nwhich I think makes it really difficult for them\n\nto say they have a different perspective and\n\nthey don\u0027t care about election administration\n\nwhen they have said we want to come in on behalf\n\nof the state as a whole.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Ms. Theodore, I\n\ntake that point, and -- but, I mean, I guess I\n\nthink that there\u0027s a kind of formalness about\n\nit. I mean, they are saying that they have a\n\ndifferent interest because they have this\n\ninterest, pure, in defending the law, unleavened\n\nby any other consideration.\n\nNow I take -- I take your point that\n\nthat\u0027s in some tension with their consistent\n\nrepresentations that they want not to represent\n\nthe legislature but, instead, to represent the\n\nwhole state, which you might think is a kind of\n\ninterest that\u0027s, even taking their own view, you\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"44","file_name":"Berger v.
