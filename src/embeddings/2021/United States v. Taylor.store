TAIBLESON:  The government has not\n\nasked for that in this case.  We would be happy,\n\nof course, to brief it should the Court request\n\nfurther briefing on that question.  It is true\n\nthat the judicial sort of chorus of complaints\n\nabout the categorical approach has been growing\n\never louder, but -- but we have not asked for\n\nthat here in light of this Court\u0027s recent\n\ndecision in Davis.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"3","file_name":"United States v.

Completed robbery,\n\nStokeling teaches, is the quintessential\n\nelements clause offense.  The distinction\n\nbetween completed and attempted robbery is that\n\nthe property is not taken.  It\u0027s not that force\n\nis absent.\n\nSo that if force is absent, it\u0027s no\n\nkind of robbery at all.  It\u0027s larceny or a theft\n\nor burglary.  So the distinction between\n\ncompleted and attempted robbery is not a\n\ndistinction that the elements clause cares\n\nabout, which really highlights how deeply\n\nimplausible it is that Congress would have\n\nwritten the elements clause to capture robbery,\n\nincluded attempt liability, but accidentally\n\nmissed attempted robbery.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you.

To get around that reality, the\n\ngovernment distorts the meaning of \"use of\n\nforce\" and \"threatened use of force\" and adopts\n\na very unorthodox meaning of \"attempt\n\nliability.\"  It argues that attempted threats\n\nare attempted uses of force, positing a meaning\n\nof \"use of force\" that contradicts this Court\u0027s\n\ncases.\n\nIt argues that the robber on the way\n\nto the target has already threatened force,\n\nadopting a definition of \"threatened\" that is\n\nforeign to criminal law, appears in no case, and\n\nhas never been used before.\n\nThe government\u0027s position does not\n\ncorrespond to what is left of the definition of\n\ncrime of violence.  It expected the elements\n\nclause to do all the work, but Congress did not.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"44","file_name":"United States v.

DREEBEN: Well, and I think the\n\nanswer to it, Justice Alito, is that the\n\ngovernment\u0027s conception today of what a\n\nsubstantial step is is not the conception that\u0027s\n\nreflected in the decisions of the circuits or\n\nthe charging practices or litigating behavior of\n\nthe government.\n\nSo a defendant who did all the things\n\nthat these hypotheticals reflect has attempted\n\nto commit a crime, and oftentimes the only\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial\n\nintent you can prove or the easiest intent to\n\nprove is that the defendant intended to\n\nthreaten.\n\nSo do defendants appeal and bring\n\nfutile arguments that really there\u0027s no such\n\nthing as an attempt to threaten? I don\u0027t know\n\nwhy they would do that because the Hobbs Act is\n\nincredibly clear that it -- it prohibits\n\nrobbery, as did the common law, by means of use\n\nof force or by means of fear.\n\nIt\u0027s enough if the robber is\n\nsuccessful in threatening and gets the property.\n\nAnd so, when the person goes to the store, all","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"55","file_name":"United States v.

DREEBEN: So, as to the first\n\nquestion, Justice Gorsuch, I think the Court\n\nshould give respectful attention to the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\ngovernment\u0027s reading of criminal statutes, but\n\nit is ultimately for this Court to say what the\n\nHobbs Act means.\n\nI don\u0027t think this is a close question\n\non the meaning of the Hobbs Act, and I\u0027m not\n\nsure my friends are disavowing the language of\n\nthe Hobbs Act that permits prosecutions for\n\nattempts and permits prosecutions for robberies\n\nby threat. You put the two of them together,\n\nand I\u0027m fairly confident that Ms. Taibleson","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"57","file_name":"United States v.

But I -- I do not understand how\n\nthe government could say that attempted threats\n\nare not a violation of the Hobbs Act for the\n\nreasons that we\u0027ve already discussed.\n\nThe Hobbs Act has multiple means of\n\ncommitting robbery:  force, fear, threatened use\n\nof violence.  And the distinction between using\n\nforce and threatening force is embedded in\n\nrobbery statutes across the country.\n\nSo all you need to do is tie to that\n\nthe -- the -- the attempt liability standards.\n\nAnd the only way the government gets out of\n\nthat, I think, as members of the courts have\n\npointed out, is by adopting very eccentric\n\ndefinitions of \"threat\" that do not involve\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"68","file_name":"United States v.

SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So along the\n\nsame lines, and just thinking about what this\n\nset of cases are that are the attempted threats\n\nor the attempted robbery by threat, and Justice\n\nKavanaugh referred to them as a few or a couple\n\nof cases, and that might be with respect to\n\nreported cases, but what I take you to be\n\nsaying, and I just want to make sure that I\n\nunderstand this, is that every time somebody is\n\napprehended in the parking lot, before he gets\n\nto the cashier, before he gets to the teller,\n\nright, and the government apprehends that person\n\nand then negotiates a plea with that person,\n\nbecause that\u0027s what happens in most of these\n\ncases, that the government is relying on the\n\nfact that it doesn\u0027t have to show an attempt to\n\nactually use force, that all it has to show, and\n\nthe culprit knows this and the government knows\n\nthis, all it has to show is an attempt to\n\nthreaten force because of the fake gun or the\n\nnote in the pocket or anything else that might\n\nconvey such an intent and that it\u0027s irrelevant\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"78","file_name":"United States v.
