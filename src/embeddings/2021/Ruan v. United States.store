ROBBINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nDr. Xiulu Ruan\u0027s jury was instructed\n\nthat it could convict him of federal narcotics\n\noffenses if he prescribed \"outside the usual\n\ncourse of professional medical practice.\"\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit sustained that\n\ninstruction precisely because it \"told the jury\n\nthat good faith was a defense\" as long as the\n\nappellant\u0027s conduct also was in accordance with\n\nthe standards of medical practice.  In other\n\nwords, good faith is a defense in the Eleventh\n\nCircuit only for doctors whose prescriptions are\n\nalready lawful.\n\nNo lawyer will stand up before the\n\nCourt this morning and defend either that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Ruan v.

ROBBINS: Okay.\n\nThank you, Your\n\nHonor.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBreyer?\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  I do have a number of\n\nquestions, Mr. Robbins.  We\u0027re interpreting a\n\nstatute, so we should start by looking at what\n\nthe statute says, and it says, \"except as\n\nauthorized by this subchapter, it shall be\n\nunlawful for any person knowingly or\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n16\n\nOfficial\n\nintentionally to\" do a variety of things.\n\nAs a matter of language, do the\n\nadverbs \"knowingly\" or \"intentionally\" modify\n\nthe introductory clause \"except as authorized by\n\nthis subchapter\"?\n\nMR. ROBBINS: The answer is yes,\n\nJustice Alito, and I\u0027d be happy to explain why I\n\nthink so.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I think my old\n\nEnglish teacher would say no, you\u0027ve gotten that\n\nanswer wrong.  There\u0027s no way they can modify\n\n\"except as authorized by this subchapter.\"  They\n\nmodify what comes later. But explain to me why\n\nthey modify it as a matter of language, not as a\n\nmatter of constitutional avoidance or something\n\nlike that.\n\nMR. ROBBINS: No, and I\u0027m not arguing\n\nconstitutional avoidance. I am arguing the\n\nprinciples of -- of -- that -- that this Court\n\nhas articulated in Rehaif and other cases.

from doctors who violate the\n\nstandard of care in various ways. That is not\n\nthe function of Section 841.\n\nThe question under 841 is not whether\n\na doctor was a bad doctor but whether he was a\n\ndrug dealer.  Thus, under 841, any good faith\n\ndefinition must be based solely on the sincerity\n\nof the doctor\u0027s purpose in writing the\n\nprescription.\n\nAnd, with that, I welcome the\n\nquestions of the Court.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you\n\nrefer to the good faith definition, and I\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nunderstand your friend on the other side to be\n\narguing that reduces to an idiosyncratic view of\n\nwhat the law ought to be.\n\nAnd I guess I don\u0027t know -- well, do\n\nyou agree with that?
