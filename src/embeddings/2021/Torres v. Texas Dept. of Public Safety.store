And something\n\nunusual was being done in Seminole Tribe, which\n\nit was trying to use the Indian commerce power\n\nto regulate the states, which is not the sense\n\nin which this Court has thought of that power as\n\nexclusive.\n\nAnd the state -- the Court has said\n\nthat the United States has plenary authority to\n\ndivest the tribes of any attributes of\n\nsovereignty.

USERRA directly advances that\n\nmission.  Its employment protections originated\n\nwith the World War II draft. They were extended\n\nto permit suits against states to combat\n\ndiscrimination against the military during the\n\nVietnam War.  And they are especially important\n\ntoday to Guard and Reserve forces, who both\n\nserve the nation and work for employers,\n\ndisproportionately including state employers.\n\nThose employers have sovereign immunity to most\n\nprivate suits, but this area is different.\n\nThe Constitution was adopted in large\n\npart to stop states from undermining federal\n\nefforts to raise a military.  This Court has\n\nnever imposed a state sovereignty-based\n\nlimitation on the federal powers to raise and\n\nsupport Armies or provide and maintain a Navy.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"36","file_name":"Torres v.

MICHEL: Well, I think the most\n\nimportant part of the Hamilton passage, and I\n\nhope this is at least partly responsive to your\n\nquestion, is that when you read that in\n\nconjunction with Hamilton\u0027s passage in\n\nFederalist 81, which this Court has relied on as\n\nthe foundation of its sovereign immunity\n\njurisprudence all the way back to Hans versus\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nLouisiana, he directly links that list that\n\nyou\u0027re talking about, Justice Breyer, in\n\nFederalist 32 with the areas in which there was\n\nan alienation of sovereignty to produce a waiver\n\nof sovereign immunity in the Plan of the\n\nConvention.\n\nSo, if you take Hamilton\u0027s word on\n\nwhat sovereign immunity means, you have to read\n\nthe whole paragraph, and he references back to\n\nthis paragraph 32. And this is where Article I,\n\nSection 10, I think, is particularly important\n\nbecause one of the categories on the list, which\n\nyou didn\u0027t read but were going to go on to read,\n\nis where a power is granted to the federal\n\ngovernment on the one hand and withheld from the\n\nstates on the other hand, that\u0027s exactly what\u0027s\n\nhappening with the Raise and Support Armies\n\nClause and --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"48","file_name":"Torres v.

That was the\n\nsame framework that Hamilton set up when he\n\nexplained when there would be a surrender in the\n\nPlan of the Convention.\n\nThe Court in Katz, in Footnote 13,\n\nreferred to the interaction between Federalist\n\n32 and Federalist 81 in explaining that the\n\nbankruptcy clause falls within another one of\n\nthose categories that\u0027s in Hamilton\u0027s essay,\n\nFederalist 32.\n\nSo I think that is powerful support,\n\nassuming the Court is going to continue to rely\n\non Hamilton\u0027s account of sovereign immunity, to\n\nunderstand where there was a surrender of\n\nsovereign immunity in the Plan of the Convention\n\nand to find that these particular powers are\n\nsubject to that surrender.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\n\nThomas, any questions?\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Yes, Chief.
