 Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSection 2 of the Federal Arbitration\n\nAct requires that an agreement to arbitrate be\n\nenforced unless a generally applicable contract\n\ndefense renders it unenforceable.  But the\n\nEighth Circuit didn\u0027t apply a generally\n\napplicable contract defense here.  It applied an\n\narbitration-specific waiver defense that\n\nrequires the person asserting waiver to prove\n\nprejudice, even though prejudice isn\u0027t required\n\nto establish waiver of other contractual rights\n\nin Iowa.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nThat\u0027s what the Eighth Circuit did\n\nwrong, and that\u0027s why we\u0027re here.  But there\u0027s\n\nbeen a lot of discussion in the briefs about\n\nSection 3 and default, so I wanted to quickly\n\nexplain what the Eighth Circuit should have done\n\ninstead.\n\nFirst, it should have assessed Robyn\n\nMorgan\u0027s waiver defense under generally\n\napplicable Iowa law to determine if there was an\n\nenforceable contract on which the procedural\n\nprovisions of the FAA could operate.  If it\n\nfound waiver under state law, that would have\n\nbeen the end of the inquiry.\n\nIf it found no waiver, meaning that\n\nthere was still a live contract for Sundance to\n\nenforce, then, because Sundance sought a stay\n\nunder Section 3, the Court would still have had\n\nto assess if Sundance\u0027s actions were in default\n\nin proceeding with the arbitration.\n\nSo whether Sundance\u0027s actions","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Morgan v.

applied in each case, to see if it is\n\nthe same?  In other words, it would seem to be a\n\nsomewhat complicated inquiry if there --\n\nthere\u0027s, you know, occasional exceptions to\n\nwhether it\u0027s waiver because you haven\u0027t asked\n\nfor punitive damages or it\u0027s waiver in other\n\nsituations.  Each situation would seem to be\n\nunique, unless, I suppose, that the state had a\n\nrule that any slight difference, sort of perfect\n\nperformance, constitutes a waiver.  You know,\n\nyou\u0027re one minute late for the argument; you\u0027re\n\n-- everything is waived.\n\nIt would seem to me it has to be kind\n\nof an issue-by-issue inquiry.\n\nMS.

GILBRIDE:  Well, Justice Kagan, if\n\nthe phrase \"in default in proceeding\" is\n\nreferring to default in proceeding under the\n\ncontract, then we would submit that state\n\ncontract law principles should be applied\n\nbecause, you know, this Court said in First\n\nOptions of Chicago, in Arthur Andersen versus\n\nCarlisle, that when you\u0027re looking at contract\n\nquestions, whether it\u0027s contract interpretation,\n\nwhether the agreement was formed, whether third\n\nparties can enforce the contract, you look to\n\nstate contract law.\n\nBut, if what that phrase at the end of\n\nSection 3 means is a statutory default, in other\n\nwords, that the party was in default in\n\nproceeding with their rights under the FAA by\n\nrequesting a stay too late in the case, then\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n9\n\nOfficial\n\nthat is something that the Court could analyze\n\nunder federal common law because you\u0027re putting\n\ncontent to what that procedural provision of\n\nSection 3 --\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and do you --\n\nMS. GILBRIDE:  -- requires.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"6","file_name":"Morgan v.

Then the\n\nsecond situation is similar to the first, but\n\nthe rule also includes some but not all other\n\ncontract defenses.

GILBRIDE:  Well, there are some\n\nstates that have merged the doctrines of waiver\n\nand estoppel.  For example, we -- we cite one in\n\n-- in Footnote 11 of our opening brief.  New\n\nMexico does that.  Sundance also cites a Vermont\n\nSupreme Court case that does that.\n\nSo, if a state treats waiver and\n\nestoppel as -- as merged for generally\n\napplicable contract defenses not in -- not\n\ninvolving arbitration, then that would be -- you\n\nknow, that -- that\u0027s what the state does, and --\n\nand we would apply the same rules to an\n\narbitration agreement.\n\nBut the problem is that many states","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"38","file_name":"Morgan v.

But even if you\n\nthought that was required, and this is why I\n\nthink the difference between arbitration, which\n\nisn\u0027t a 12(h)(1) must raise defense, and other\n\ndefenses is important, is you could think about\n\nthis, okay, let\u0027s say we had to add it in the\n\nanswer as a preliminary step to filing this\n\nmotion.\n\nWe\u0027re past the point where we get to\n\namend as of right, but this is one of the many\n\nthings in the federal rules where you have,\n\nlike, an ability to make a motion, but there\u0027s\n\nno strict deadline.\n\nAnd so the way the courts would figure\n\nout whether it\u0027s too late to amend your\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n80\n\nOfficial\n\ncomplaint to add arbitration would be to\n\nessentially say, well, the presumption is leave\n\nis freely granted, but we withhold it in certain\n\ncircumstances and we look to prejudice.\n\nIn fact, cases like Forman, which we\n\ncite in our brief, say that prejudice is more or\n\nless the -- the most important factor.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"72","file_name":"Morgan v.

Even if this Court does analyze\n\nthe question under Section 3, if you look at the\n\nstructure of the FAA, over and over again you\n\nsee indications that things should be done in a\n\nsummary manner. The word \"summarily\" appears\n\ntwice in Section 4, summarily to the trial, that\n\nthe judge shall summarily send the parties to\n\narbitration.\n\nSection 16, the fact that you have an\n\ninterlocutory appeal if there\u0027s a refusal of a\n\nrequest for a stay or a denial of a motion to\n\ncompel but not if it\u0027s granted or if the stay is\n\n-- so -- so, basically, the idea, as this Court\n\nsaid in Prima Paint, is that once the parties\n\nselect arbitration, it must be speedy and not\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n84\n\nOfficial\n\nsubject to delay and obstruction in the courts.\n\nThe current status quo that requires\n\nprejudice and requires the party asserting\n\nwaiver to show prejudice results in delay and\n\nobstruction in the courts over and over again.\n\nAnd Sundance, my friend here, wants\n\nthe standard to be substantial participation in\n\ndiscovery.
