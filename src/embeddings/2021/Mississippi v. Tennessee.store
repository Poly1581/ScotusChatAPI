FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nTennessee has lawfully pumped\n\ngroundwater out of the Middle Claiborne Aquifer\n\non its side of the border for more than 130\n\nyears. The Special Master correctly recommended\n\ndismissal of Mississippi\u0027s complaint but erred\n\nin suggesting that Mississippi be freely granted\n\nleave to amend.\n\nFirst, the Equitable Apportionment\n\nDoctrine provides the exclusive remedy for\n\ncomplaints about the usage of water that flows\n\nfrom one state into another and the actions in\n\none state affect interstate water flow.\n\nMississippi\u0027s claim for more than $600 million\n\nin damages, therefore, must be dismissed.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\nMississippi\u0027s principal argument in\n\nresponse is that the aquifer water flows slowly.\n\nBut this Court has never conditioned the\n\napplication of the Equitable Apportionment\n\nDoctrine on water velocity.\n\nHere, even Mississippi\u0027s expert\n\nacknowledged that in predevelopment conditions,\n\nmore than 37 million gallons of water per day\n\nflowed out of Mississippi and into adjoining\n\nstates.\n\nSecond, the Master did not consider\n\nhow this case would fundamentally change if\n\nMississippi were freely allowed to amend to\n\nplead an equitable apportionment action at this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"31","file_name":"Mississippi v.

FREDERICK:  Well, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, I think you would say that it is water\n\nbecause it\u0027s some of the finest water that\n\nanyone can drink in the United States. This\n\nartesian water is absolutely spectacular water\n\nthat they have pumped, and they have run it over\n\nfilters that filter out some of the iron and\n\nsome of the other minerals, but it is very pure\n\nwater and it is delicious.\n\nAnd I would urge the Court to consider\n\nthe aquifer -- just because it is -- it is mixed\n\nin with sediment does not distinguish what it\n\nactually is, which is water when it is pulled\n\nout, and it is not a sophisticated scientific\n\noperation to do that.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n56\n\nOfficial\n\nJustice Thomas?\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  No questions, Chief.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBreyer?\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  No.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito?\n\nNo?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"49","file_name":"Mississippi v.
