Section 6330(d)(1)\n\ndoes not have the needed clarity.\n\nThe first clause reads like an\n\nordinary statute of limitations. It says what\n\nthe taxpayer may do, and it says nothing about\n\nthe Tax Court\u0027s jurisdiction.  The second\n\nclause does speak to jurisdiction, but the only\n\nreference back to the first is through the two\n\nwords \"such matter.\"\n\nNow we think \"such matter\" refers to a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\npetition to the Tax Court for review of a CDP\n\ndetermination.

It stops\n\nat the closest reasonable antecedent, and it\n\nuses the word \"matter\" as it\u0027s ordinarily\n\nunderstood.  The Commissioner\u0027s reading\n\nrequires more work, and it requires this Court\n\nto treat the time limit the same as subject\n\nmatter in the context of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.  If nothing else, it is far from\n\nclear.\n\nThe statutory history resolves any\n\ndoubt. As originally enacted, the same time\n\nlimit governed the Tax Court and the district\n\ncourts and it was not jurisdictional.  The\n\nrelevant language has not changed.

It refers to the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt and how that jurisdiction is confirmed.\n\nIt\u0027s by the filing within 30 days.\n\nI mean, I understand if it were a\n\nprovision that said, you know, the petition for\n\nreview shall be filed within 30 days and -- and\n\nthis -- you know, take it from there.

Yes.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Because I think\n\nthis is somewhat different contextually than\n\nsome of the other provisions we\u0027ve had over the\n\nyears because, here, if you miss the time\n\nlimit, you\u0027re not boxed out entirely, as the\n\ngovernment points out.\n\nYou could pay and -- and sue for a\n\nrefund.  So there is that avenue for\n\nproceeding.  And there\u0027s also -- maybe not\n\napplicable to this case, but in many of the\n\ncases covered by this -- also the opportunity\n\nfor the -- the pre-assessment determination as\n\nwell.\n\nSo it seems to me contextually\n\nCongress has a scheme here where there are\n\nother paths for someone to proceed even if you\n\nmiss the deadline.\n\nWhat\u0027s your response to that?\n\nMS.

You can\u0027t be in state court\n\nand federal court at the same time, and a year\n\ncan come and go before you have an opportunity\n\nto get into federal court.\n\nI think it\u0027s the exact same rationale\n\nwhen it comes to the bankruptcy exception.

The narrow dispute is whether \"such\n\nmatter\" refers to a petition that meets both of\n\nthe first clause\u0027s requirements or selectively\n\nincorporates just one.\n\nThe clear meaning of the text in\n\ncontext is that \"such matter\" refers to a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\npetition that satisfies both.

And the time limit is\n\nembedded in the verb phrase.\n\nThat is confirmed by paragraph (e)(1)\n\nat page 14a of our appendix, which undisputedly\n\nmakes the Tax Court\u0027s jurisdiction to grant an\n\ninjunction contingent on a timely petition.\n\nPetitioner cannot explain why Congress would\n\nmake a timely petition a jurisdictional\n\nprerequisite to that remedy but not to the\n\nCourt\u0027s authority to decide the case.\n\nThe interlocking statutory structure\n\nand nearly a century of decisions addressing\n\nanalogous Tax Court provisions reinforce that\n\nunderstanding.\n\nPetitioner\u0027s argument at bottom is\n\nthat various non-jurisdictional readings can be\n\nposited.

But I think the\n\nCourt has distinguished equitable tolling from\n\nstatutory case -- tolling in cases like CalPERS\n\nversus ANZ, where it says equitable tolling\n\nisn\u0027t interpreting the statute to say it is\n\nextended for this period.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  My only other\n\nquestion is, what terrible thing will happen\n\nif, in fact, we say, okay, yeah, you can have\n\nequitable tolling?  I mean, there are other\n\nprovisions that say you can\u0027t file a petition\n\nthat\u0027s going to interfere with the levying.\n\nThere\u0027s another provision that says it can\u0027t be\n\nfrivolous.  So we have those two in operation.\n\nSo what awful thing will happen?\n\nMR.

You apply it\n\nto actually decide the scope question. And\n\nthat\u0027s really what we\u0027re talking about here.\n\nIt\u0027s a jurisdiction-conferring provision.

win on this because, as the Court said in\n\nHenderson, this Court has a preference to treat\n\ntime limits like claim-processing rules.  If\n\nCongress has a different preference and\n\nactually thinks about it, then Congress has to\n\nspeak clearly, and it hasn\u0027t done so here.\n\nAs far as (e)(1) goes, a few points on\n\nthat. Number one, it is very much the tail\n\nwagging the dog.  We think \"timely\" absolutely\n\nhas the interpretation we give it, which is it\n\nincludes equitable tolling.  Look no further\n\nthan this Court\u0027s decision in Artis, which said\n\nthat tolling is pausing, it\u0027s stopping the\n\nclock. Even the dissent that disagreed with\n\nthat with respect to that statute said in\n\nFootnote 10 that is how we understand equitable\n\ntolling.  So we think that answers it, and\n\nthere\u0027s no incongruity at all.\n\nBut the other thing I think is worth\n\nlooking at is the first sentence in (e)(1).\n\nThat\u0027s the one that tells the IRS that it can\u0027t\n\ncollect.

to say that a taxpayer can\u0027t go to the\n\nTax Court and has to go to another court before\n\nthere\u0027s an appeal in the Tax Court. And so, to\n\nthe extent the IRS levies while a CDP hearing\n\nis happening before the Office of Appeals, that\n\ntaxpayer has to go to district court.\n\nSo the final sentence, understood our\n\nway, makes complete sense.

to get back to Congress\u0027s intent\n\nhere and to Henderson specifically, they say --\n\nyou know, the Commissioner says that 30 days,\n\nit was meant to be very, very short and quick.\n\nThe same argument was made in Henderson and\n\nrejected.  The argument there was, before this\n\nlegislation was passed, there was absolutely no\n\njudicial review at all. And so the government\n\nargued, well, yeah, they gave you judicial\n\nreview, but they meant it to be strict and\n\njurisdictional.  And the Court rejected that\n\nargument there because it was veteran-friendly\n\nlegislation.  The same is true here.
