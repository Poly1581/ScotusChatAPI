Circuit\n\nCity held that the exemption reaches only\n\nclasses of workers engaged in foreign or\n\ninterstate transportation.  As then Judge\n\nBarrett held in Wallace, that means an exempted\n\nclass of workers must perform work analogous to\n\nthat of seamen and railroad employees.\n\nSeamen and railroad employees\u0027 key\n\ncharacteristic was working on ships and trains.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nWe know that because \"seamen\" was a term of art.\n\nIt meant workers who predominantly worked on a\n\nvessel.  Vessels, by definition, transported or\n\nwere capable of transporting goods or people\n\nover water. And the paradigmatic seamen, as the\n\nCourt noted in Chandris, sailed long voyages.\n\nThat made seamen as a class actively\n\nengaged in foreign or interstate transportation.\n\nCritically, seamen did not include land-based\n\nmaritime employees.  By specifying seamen,\n\nCongress excluded stevedores, who are land-based\n\ncargo loaders.\n\nNow Saxon says the exemption covers\n\nthe entire airline industry.  But Section 1\n\nexempts classes of workers, not industries,\n\nengaged in foreign or interstate transportation.\n\nIt says \"seamen,\" not maritime employees.  It\n\nrepeats \"foreign or interstate,\" emphasizing\n\nborder crossing.  And placed among these other\n\nwords, \"railroad employees\" similarly means\n\nworkers who perform their duties on the train.\n\nSaxon is not exempt from the FAA.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Southwest Airlines Co. v.

Those words\n\nexempt airline employees who load and unload\n\ncargo.\n\nSouthwest can\u0027t dispute that by 1925\n\nit was blackletter law that the transportation\n\nof goods in commerce begins when they\u0027re given\n\nto a carrier and it only ends when they\u0027re\n\nreceived at their final destination.\n\nIndeed, this Court had repeatedly held\n\nthat loading and unloading cargo specifically is\n\npart of that transportation, not ancillary to\n\ntransportation or connected to transportation,\n\nbut it is itself transportation, that it is\n\nitself commerce.\n\nAnd just the year before the FAA was\n\npassed, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\nCourt held that it was too plain to require\n\ndiscussion that a worker who unloaded a train\n\nwas a railroad employee and that that railroad\n\nemployee was engaged in interstate commerce.\n\nYet Southwest contends that workers\n\nwho load and unload airplanes are not part of\n\nany class of workers engaged in commerce for\n\npurposes of the FAA.\n\nThere\u0027s no support for this contention\n\nin the text of the statute. Southwest can\u0027t\n\npoint to even a single example from any time\n\nperiod in which the phrase \"engaged in foreign\n\nor interstate commerce\" has ever been given the\n\nmeaning it proposes.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"34","file_name":"Southwest Airlines Co. v.

Would it be a percentage of the\n\npeople?  Would the class of workers be Lyft\n\ndrivers?  Would it be Uber drivers?\n\nBut even in heartland classes of\n\nworkers, heartland categories of workers on the\n\nrailroad and the airline, it is difficult to\n\nknow how to apply Southwest\u0027s test.\n\nSo, if you take, for example,\n\nloadmasters, that\u0027s a really key airline\n\nfunction for freight airlines, and what they do\n\nis they balance the load of the air -- of the\n\nairplane so it doesn\u0027t fall out of the sky, and\n\nsometimes they\u0027re at airports and sometimes they\n\nride on the plane.\n\nAnd sometimes the same person does\n\nboth. Sometimes those are different people.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"47","file_name":"Southwest Airlines Co. v.

few points in rebuttal.\n\nFirst of all, Ms. Bennett and I agree,\n\nof course, that \"engaged in foreign or\n\ninterstate commerce\" has to mean engaged in the\n\nsame way as seamen and railroad employees.\n\nWith respect to seamen, seamen as a\n\nclass are not those who did the work of the\n\nmaritime industry.  They did a particular\n\nfunction within the maritime industry, but it\u0027s\n\nincorrect to -- to say that the commonality that\n\ncan be extrapolated to the residual clause is\n\nsimply doing the work of the industry.\n\nWith respect to railroad employees, I\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n72\n\nOfficial\n\nwant to give a few specific examples of how\n\nrailroad employees were understood at the time\n\nmore -- more narrowly than what Ms. Bennett is\n\nsuggesting.\n\nJustice Gorsuch, you asked about the\n\nTransportation Act.  Under the Transportation\n\nAct, it wasn\u0027t all railroad employees. There\u0027s\n\na decision from 1922 of the Railway Labor Board\n\nin which train dispatchers were excluded from\n\nthe scope of the Transportation Act because they\n\nhad a supervisory role, much like, by analogy,\n\nramp agent supervisors have a supervisory role.\n\nSo even the Transportation Act did not\n\nextend all the way to include everybody who in\n\nsome way contributed to the work of the\n\nrailroad.\n\nThe Hours of Service Act from 1907\n\napplied by its terms to persons actually engaged\n\nin or connection with the movement of any train.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"63","file_name":"Southwest Airlines Co. v.
