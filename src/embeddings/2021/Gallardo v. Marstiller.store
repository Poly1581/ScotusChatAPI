SURI: At the very least, Justice\n\nGorsuch, even if the case couldn\u0027t proceed\n\nunder Section 1983, we expect it could proceed\n\nunder Ex parte Young.  The state is taking an\n\naction that would be contrary to federal law,\n\nand the individual is entitled to bring an Ex\n\nparte Young case to say that action cannot\n\nproceed.\n\nNow the argument on the other side,\n\naccording to the states\u0027 amicus brief that you\n\nhave cited, is that Ex parte Young wouldn\u0027t\n\napply where Congress has implicitly foreclosed\n\nit, and they\u0027ve relied on this Court\u0027s decision\n\nin Armstrong.\n\nBut Armstrong was a case in which the\n\nCourt said that the provision being applied was\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"36","file_name":"Gallardo v.

question here is whether the\n\nprogram may seek that reimbursement from a tort\n\nsettlement, not only out of medical damages or\n\nmedical expenses paid in the past but also for\n\nmedical expenses

Medical expenses may include\n\nexpenses that Medicaid paid and expenses that\n\nthe beneficiary paid.  The remainder provision\n\nsays that if Medicaid recovers all of those\n\nmedical expenses, Medicaid is reimbursed for\n\nits expenses and the remaining amount goes to\n\nthe beneficiary.\n\nBut, if there isn\u0027t enough money to\n\nreimburse both Medicaid and the beneficiary,\n\nthe remainder provision says that Medicaid gets\n\npaid first.  In other words, far from\n\nprohibiting Medicaid from recovering out of all\n\nmedical damages, Section 1396k gives Medicaid\u0027s\n\nreimbursement claim priority over other claims\n\nto medical expenses.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"54","file_name":"Gallardo v.
