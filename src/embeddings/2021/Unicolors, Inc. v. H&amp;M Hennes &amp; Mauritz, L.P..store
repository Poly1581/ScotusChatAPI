Court can get to that result\n\nthrough two separate routes.\n\nThe first is the\n\nplain text, and the second is a presumption.  No\n\ncourt in a century had invalidated a copyright\n\nregistration based upon an innocent legal error.\n\nAnd Congress is presumed not to have\n\nradically changed that rule by hiding that\n\nchange in the word \"knowledge.\"  Like the\n\ncourts, Congress considered it more important to\n\ngive authors and artists an effective remedy\n\nagainst IP thieves than it was to demand perfect\n\ncompliance with complex legal requirements in a\n\nform.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit\u0027s rule will wreak\n\nhavoc. Every time a court decides an unsettled\n\nquestion of law, it would cast doubt on the\n\nvalidity of countless registrations.\n\nNow there are three specific points to\n\nmake about the text here. The first is that\n\nSection 411(b) starts with a default rule that a\n\nregistration is valid \"regardless of any\" --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\n\"any inaccurate information.\"  So that means\n\nwithout regard to whether that information is a\n\nfact or a legal conclusion.\n\nSecond, Section 411(b) is pretty\n\nunique among the statutes that this Court has\n\nencountered in the past in that it\u0027s not\n\nrequiring knowledge of several elements and all\n\nyou have to do is figure out which one needs to\n\nbe knowing, but, here, it requires knowledge of\n\nvery -- something very specific.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"3","file_name":"Unicolors, Inc. v.

there are very\n\nstrongly held views on questions of formality\n\nand whether it makes sense.\n\nAnd if you look from administration to\n\nadministration, like, the views of the United\n\nStates have changed dramatically.
