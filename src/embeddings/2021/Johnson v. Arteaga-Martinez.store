RAYNOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSection 1231(a)(6) states that certain\n\ncategories of non-citizens, including\n\ninadmissible non-citizens like Respondent here,\n\n\"may be detained beyond the removal period.\"\n\nThe question presented in this case is\n\nwhether that language requires that\n\nnon-citizens detained under Section 1231(a)(6)\n\nbe afforded a bond hearing before an\n\nimmigration judge after six months of\n\ndetention, at which the government bears the\n\nburden of proving by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the non-citizen is either a\n\nflight risk or a danger to the community.

He accordingly\n\nfocuses on an altogether different issue,\n\nnamely, whether he is entitled to outright\n\nrelease under this Court\u0027s decision in Zadvydas\n\nbecause his removal is not reasonably\n\nforeseeable.\n\nThat argument would require modifying\n\nthe judgment below, which afforded Respondent a\n\nbond hearing, not outright release.  Because he\n\ndid not file a cross-petition for a writ of\n\ncertiorari, that argument is not properly\n\npresented here, and this Court should reject it\n\nfor that reason alone.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Johnson v.

And then it adverted to the\n\nstatistics, which were later modified, although\n\nnot in significant respects.\n\nHere, even if you wanted to focus on\n\nthe empirical aspect of this, the data that\n\nRespondent has submitted just suggests there\u0027s\n\nnot a -- not a big problem here. About\n\n80 percent of these non-citizens don\u0027t appeal\n\nIJ determinations from withholding-only\n\nproceedings, and they\u0027re detained for an\n\naverage of 114 days according to Respondent\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\nOfficial\n\ndata.\n\nAnd then, even if you look at the\n\nentire category of non-citizens, some who\n\nappeal, some who do not, still the average\n\nlength of detention is 157 days.

The government responds\n\nthat Zadvydas dealt only with the risk of\n\npermanent detention.\n\nAlthough that risk certainly raised\n\ndue process concerns motivating the Court\u0027s\n\nstatutory construction, its construction was\n\nnot limited to that extreme scenario.\n\nSection 1231(a)(6) prohibits continued\n\ndetention after six months where, as here,\n\nthere is \"no significant likelihood of removal\n\nin the reasonably foreseeable future,\" not at\n\njust some point ever.\n\nAs Justice Scalia, who dissented in\n\nZadvydas, confirmed in Clark v. Martinez, that\n\nsame construction must apply to all\n\nnon-citizens subject to Section 1231(a)(6),\n\nincluding Mr. Arteaga-Martinez.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"31","file_name":"Johnson v.

One is Congress --\n\nCongress had made the categorical judgment that\n\ncategorical -- that criminal aliens were too\n\ndangerous to release, one major distinction.\n\nSecond major distinction is the period\n\nof detention.  The Court functioned on the\n\npremise that in the vast majority of cases\n\nthese people were detained less than two\n\nmonths, about a month or month and a half.\n\nAnd in the outer limit case, they were\n\ndetained at five months.  So they didn\u0027t even\n\nhit the presumptive unconstitutional line that\n\nthis Court set up in Zadvydas.  So I don\u0027t see\n\nhow Demore v.

The -- the burden of proof is -- is just\n\nthis, the alien has to provide good reason to\n\nbelieve there\u0027s no significant likelihood of\n\nremoval, and then the government has to rebut\n\nit.\n\nAnd so we -- we accept that in that\n\nsituation, under the logically antecedent\n\nargument, we have to show a good reason of no\n\nsignificant likelihood of removal in the\n\nreasonably foreseeable future, but we\u0027ve amply\n\nmet that here given that he had not even been\n\ngiven a hearing on his substantive claim at the\n\nsix-month mark.\n\nThere is no chance, not even a\n\nsignificant likelihood, there is no chance he\n\ncould have been removed in the reasonably\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n65\n\nOfficial\n\nforeseeable future because the law bars you to\n\nbe removed until you\u0027ve gotten a hearing, an IJ\n\ndecision, and a BIA appeal.  So we\u0027re talking\n\ncomfortably months, if not years, from that\n\nsix-month mark.\n\nSo, Justice Kagan, hopefully, I\u0027ve\n\nanswered the question.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"58","file_name":"Johnson v.

So, as to the -- as\n\nto the bond hearing-related argument, I don\u0027t\n\nthink the core of our argument has to do with\n\nthe -- the burden of -- of proof and clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, which I agree with you is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n66\n\nOfficial\n\nnot articulated in Zadvydas.\n\nQuite frankly, Your Honor, I don\u0027t\n\nthink this Court has to reach that issue\n\nbecause the government has never argued that\n\nthe bond hearing in our case turned on whether\n\nit had a clear and convincing burden of proof.\n\nThe government didn\u0027t even submit a brief in\n\nopposition to the bond hearing.  It didn\u0027t even\n\nappeal our client\u0027s release on a bond.\n\nClear and convincing had nothing to do","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"59","file_name":"Johnson v.

The\n\nargument on which we sought certiorari and\n\nwhich the lower court ruled on was the argument\n\nthat, after six months of detention, a\n\nnon-citizen is entitled to a bond hearing at\n\nwhich he can prove that he\u0027s not a flight -- or\n\nat which the government has to prove that he\u0027s\n\nnot a flight risk -- or that he is a flight\n\nrisk or a danger to the community.\n\nNow Respondent has virtually abandoned\n\nhis defense of the court of appeals\u0027 decision\n\non that point.  His entire presentation ignored\n\nthat argument and focused on a new argument\n\nthat they interjected at the merits stage in\n\nthis Court, that under a straightforward\n\napplication of Zadvydas, removal is not\n\nreasonably foreseeable.\n\nThat argument is procedurally barred.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"62","file_name":"Johnson v.

For\n\nZadvydas category non-citizens, they don\u0027t have\n\nany pending proceedings.  But, for people like\n\nRespondent, who are in withholding-only\n\nproceedings, that is detention pending a\n\nproceeding.\n\nSo, in Jennings, that\u0027s a good example\n\nof this, the Court didn\u0027t talk about Zadvydas,\n\nthe Court didn\u0027t suggest that Zadvydas was a\n\nlimitation, the Court didn\u0027t even reach the\n\nconstitutional concerns in -- in Jennings.
