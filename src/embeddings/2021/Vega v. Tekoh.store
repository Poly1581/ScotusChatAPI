MARTINEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Ninth Circuit\u0027s extension of\n\nMiranda into 1983 litigation is inconsistent\n\nwith settled precedent and sound policy.  For\n\ntwo reasons, you should reverse.\n\nFirst, Miranda is a judicially crafted\n\nprophylactic rule, and the violation of such a\n\nrule doesn\u0027t violate the constitutional rights\n\nof any person.  That\u0027s what the Chavez plurality\n\nsaid, reiterating pre-Dickerson holdings that\n\nMiranda violations result in no constitutional\n\ndeprivation, that\u0027s Payne, and no identifiable\n\nconstitutional harm, that\u0027s Elstad.\n\nTekoh and the Ninth Circuit say that\n\nDickerson abandoned these cases.

In that\n\ncontext, when a defendant\u0027s liberty is at stake,\n\nMiranda creates a protective fence around the\n\nFifth Amendment.  It gives defendants a windfall\n\nbenefit by excluding statements that are\n\ncompletely voluntary.  A trial court\u0027s Miranda\n\nviolation taking away that windfall is\n\nreversible error, but it doesn\u0027t violate the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Vega v.

And if you\n\nread closely at what it says that evidence\n\nshows, I think what it says is that in a lot of\n\ncases people were encouraged to give warnings\n\nbecause it would help protect the admissibility\n\nof statements under a totality-of-circumstances\n\nanalysis.\n\nWhat the cases don\u0027t show -- or what\n\nthe examples don\u0027t show, what the historical\n\nevidence does not show is that there is a\n\nmandatory rule of exclusion, which is what\n\nMiranda recognized.  And it certainly doesn\u0027t\n\nshow that there\u0027s a mandatory rule of exclusion\n\nthat somehow gives right to a private cause of\n\naction for money damages.\n\nSo I think that the evidence is\n\nactually telling in what it doesn\u0027t show, and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n29\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"25","file_name":"Vega v.
