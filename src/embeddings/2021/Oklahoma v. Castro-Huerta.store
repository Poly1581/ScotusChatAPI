SHANMUGAM\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case presents a question that has\n\ntaken on exceptional practical importance in the\n\nwake of McGirt.  The question is whether a state\n\nhas authority to prosecute non-Indians who\n\ncommit crimes in Indian country, regardless of\n\nwhether the victim is a non-Indian or an Indian.\n\nThe answer to that question is yes.\n\nThe state has inherent sovereign authority to\n\npunish crimes committed within its borders, and\n\nno federal law preempts that authority as to\n\ncrimes committed by non-Indians.\n\nRespondent relies on two statutes, the\n\nGeneral Crimes Act and Public Law 280. But\n\nneither of those statutes says anything about\n\npreemption.

It does not go further and address\n\nstate jurisdiction.\n\nAnd as this Court has also explained,\n\nPublic Law 280 simply expanded the criminal and\n\ncivil jurisdiction of qualifying states.

In fact, it\u0027s the subject of a\n\ncurrently pending cert petition by my client,\n\nthe State of Oklahoma.\n\nCourts have looked to factors such as\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n8\n\nOfficial\n\nenrollment status, blood quantum, and the like.\n\nThe Oklahoma courts have applied a totality of\n\ncircumstances test.\n\nAnd so, certainly, one virtue of our\n\nrule is that for state law enforcement, states\n\nwould have jurisdiction over non-Indian\n\noffenders regardless of the status of the\n\nvictim.  And I would submit that that\u0027s\n\nconsistent with the broader framework that this\n\nCourt has used for preemption purposes.\n\nThis Court time and again in this area\n\nhas defined the tribal interest as the interest\n\nin self-governance, an interest that, as I\n\nindicated in my opening, incorporates an\n\ninterest in punishing tribal offenders.

it said, \"nothing in the language or\n\nlegislative history of Public Law 280 indicates\n\nthat it was meant to divest states of\n\npreexisting and otherwise lawfully assumed\n\njurisdiction.\"  And

 Well, I think that\n\nthat\u0027s correct, and I do think that that is a\n\nreason why this is a much easier case than a\n\ncase involving Indian defendants because I do\n\nthink that if you have a case involving Indian\n\ndefendants, the tribal interest suddenly becomes\n\nmore significant.  And I think, when it comes to\n\nnon-Indian perpetrators, it\u0027s really hard to see\n\nwhy a bright line should be drawn as to state\n\nauthority between non-Indian victims and Indian\n\nvictims.  The state\u0027s authority here is at its\n\nbroadest because we\u0027re talking about the state\u0027s\n\npolice power.\n\nThe federal government has authority,\n\nbut it\u0027s somewhat narrower because that\n\nauthority requires a relationship with the tribe\n\nin order to implicate the federal government\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n67\n\nOfficial\n\nenumerated powers.\n\nAnd I would respectfully submit that\n\nthe tribe\u0027s authority in this area is at its\n\nnarrowest because it is what the tribe has by\n\nmeans of reserved authority in this context,\n\nwhich has to implicate the right to\n\nself-governance, or any authority which has been\n\nconferred on the tribes by Congress.\n\nAnd I would submit that one reason why\n\nthe tribes may be opposing our position is\n\nbecause the tribes themselves would like for\n\nCongress to confer this law enforcement\n\nauthority on them.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBarrett.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"59","file_name":"Oklahoma v.

SHANMUGAM:  I think it\u0027s, frankly,\n\na little bit hard to sort of detect a pattern,\n\nand it\u0027s complicated by the fact that in many of\n\nthe states that have opted in, because there\n\nwere issues with the way in which the states did\n\nso, there are some states that simply don\u0027t\n\nexercise that authority.  There are at least a\n\ncouple of states that have retroceded that\n\nauthority.\n\nBut I think my fundamental point would\n\nbe that opting into Public Law 280 is a major\n\nassumption of jurisdiction because, again, the\n\ncriminal jurisdiction and the civil\n\njurisdiction, with the caveat of the Cabazon\n\nBand limitation, is plenary.  It covers criminal\n\ncases where the offenders were Indians as well\n\nas cases where the victims were Indians, and, of\n\ncourse, the grant of civil jurisdiction covers\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n73\n\nOfficial\n\nany civil action between Indians or to which\n\nIndians are parties.\n\nSo it\u0027s a major step for a state to do\n\nso, and at least since tribal consent was\n\nrequired, there are no states that have been\n\nable to do so, and I think it\u0027s a fair inference\n\nthat Oklahoma would be unable to do so in light\n\nof the position of the tribes today.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"64","file_name":"Oklahoma v.

I mean, if you look, for example, at\n\nthe 1817 statute that was the precursor to the\n\nGeneral Crimes Act, it uses actually language\n\nthat\u0027s pretty similar to what\u0027s now in the Major\n\nCrimes Act.  It says that defendants shall be\n\nsubject to like punishment as others within\n\nareas of exclusive federal jurisdiction.  So,\n\nyou know, that -- their argument, I think, would\n\nmake the 1817 General Crimes Act preemptive.\n\nAnd I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any story in which the\n\nGeneral Crimes Act, you know, was preemptive in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n107\n\nOfficial\n\n1817 and stopped being that after.\n\nBut I think the more fundamental point\n\nis that none of these nuances really have\n\nanything to do with why this Court in John and\n\nNegonsott held that the Major Crimes Act was\n\npreemptive under the Indian country preemption\n\nstandard.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nMr. Kneedler.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S.

I\u0027d like to cover the relevant\n\npreemption principles, talk a little bit about\n\nthe cases, and then finally talk about the\n\npractical consequences.\n\nMy friend, Mr. Kneedler, says that\n\nthis is \"preemption of a sort.\"  Well, it can\u0027t\n\nbe that.  It has to be some form of preemption\n\nthat this Court has recognized, and it seems to\n\nus that there are three possibilities.\n\nThe first is obviously conflict\n\npreemption.  And my friend, Mr. Schauf, talked\n\nonly about the General Crimes Act.
