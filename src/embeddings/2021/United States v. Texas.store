the\n\nsupremacy of federal law in open defiance of our\n\nconstitutional structure.  States are free to\n\nask this Court to reconsider its constitutional\n\nprecedents, but they are not free to place\n\nthemselves above this Court, nullify the Court\u0027s\n\ndecisions in their borders, and block the\n\njudicial review necessary to vindicate federal\n\nrights.\n\nAs this case comes to the Court, there\n\nare three principal questions:  First, is Texas\n\nresponsible for this law?  Second, can the\n\nUnited States sue to hold Texas to account?\n\nAnd, third, is the injunctive relief available?\n\nAnd the answer is yes down the line.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nTexas is responsible for the constitutional\n\nviolation here.

because there has never\n\nbeen a law exactly like this one. No state has\n\never sought to challenge the supremacy of\n\nfederal law and keep the courts out of the\n\nequation in quite the same way.\n\nBut I think that there are relevant\n\nprinciples to distill from the Debs line of\n\ncases. And what the Court has said is that the\n\nUnited States cannot come in and seek to\n\nintervene in a merely private dispute.

That is the ordinary way that an Ex\n\nparte Young action proceeds.  And if the state\n\nhad not specifically sought to thwart that\n\nmechanism here by outsourcing the enforcement\n\nauthority to the general public, that kind of\n\ninjunction would have been appropriate.\n\nBut the problem is that the state has\n\nspecifically, by delegating to members of the\n\ngeneral public this enforcement authority, it\u0027s\n\nspecifically made it impossible to determine in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n13\n\nOfficial\n\nadvance who was going to become an S.B. 8\n\nplaintiff, who was going to actually choose to\n\nfile suit.

It\u0027s the flood of S.B. 8\n\nenforcement suits that could be filed that is\n\nchilling the exercise of the constitutional\n\nright today.

it\u0027s the abortion right?  How\n\nabout the issue of severability? You want to\n\nenjoin every action that\u0027s brought under S.B. 8\n\neven though some of them would not violate Roe\n\nor Casey.\n\nAnd I guess the justification for that\n\nis that in the abortion context, as we held in\n\nthe prior Whole Woman\u0027s Health case,\n\nseverability doesn\u0027t count.

concluded that it would\n\neffectively amount to legislative work to walk\n\nthrough S.B. 8 and try to parse it provision by\n\nprovision and application by application to\n\ndetermine which applications would be\n\nconstitutionally permissible, but --\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is that -- is\n\nthat what you want us to do?

whose rights are most directly affected,\n\nnot the providers who have been chilled in being\n\nable to provide those women with care, and not\n\nthe United States in this suit. They say that\n\nfederal courts just have no authority under\n\nexisting law to provide any mechanism to redress\n\nthat harm.\n\nAnd if that is true, if a state can\n\njust take this simple mechanism of taking its\n\nenforcement authority and giving it to the\n\ngeneral public backed up with a bounty of\n\n$10,000 or $1 million, if they can do that, then\n\nno constitutional right is safe.
