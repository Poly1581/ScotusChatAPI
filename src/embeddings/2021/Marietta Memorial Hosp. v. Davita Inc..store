 I am, Your Honor.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may\n\nproceed.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW GUARNIERI\n\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\n\nSUPPORTING REVERSAL\n\nMR. GUARNIERI:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Medicare secondary payer statute\n\ndoes not forbid group health plans from adopting\n\nuniform limits on coverage for renal dialysis.\n\nFundamentally, the non-differentiation provision\n\nforbids only arrangements under which a group\n\nhealth plan provides different benefits to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial\n\nindividuals with end-stage renal disease and\n\nother individuals covered by the plan.\n\nPetitioners\u0027 plan does not do that.\n\nRespondents\u0027 proxy theory is therefore\n\nirrelevant.  This plan is not providing a\n\ndifferent package of benefits in the first\n\nplace, by proxy or otherwise.\n\nNow it\u0027s true that uniform limits on\n\ndialysis principally affect those who need\n\ndialysis the most, but this statute also does\n\nnot impose disparate impact liability.\n\nRespondents\u0027 contrary view is inconsistent with\n\nthe text, purpose, and history of the statute\n\nand would be unworkable in practice.\n\nThis statute serves an important but\n\nlimited function in coordinating benefits\n\nbetween Medicare and group health plans.  It\n\ndoes not entitle dialysis providers to any\n\nparticular level of reimbursement.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"42","file_name":"Marietta Memorial Hosp. v.

the\n\nopinion, \"a plan would violate the MSP if it\n\nprovided differential coverage for routine\n\nmaintenance dialysis,\" that is, dialysis\n\nreceived only by persons with ESRD, \"than for\n\nall

reference the fact that as\n\nhas been mentioned by several members of the\n\nCourt, there is another provision that is on the\n\nbasis of either ESRD, calling it out by name, or\n\nthe need for renal dialysis or any other manner.\n\nAnd that\u0027s because, as -- as I think\n\nJustice Kagan\u0027s question suggested, Congress\n\nunderstood at the time that other proxies for\n\nESRD might exist or more likely might come to\n\nexist with medical advances.\n\nAnd so the statute also prohibits\n\ndifferentiation on any other manner, which, in\n\nHeritage Reporting
