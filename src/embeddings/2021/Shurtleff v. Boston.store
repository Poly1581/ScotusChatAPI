Viewpoint discrimination is\n\nimpermissible in every category.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that\n\ncan\u0027t be right because, if it\u0027s -- if it\u0027s a --\n\na government forum and this is government\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial\n\nspeech, they can certainly discriminate on the\n\nbasis of viewpoint, right?\n\nMR.

It\u0027s nothing like Walker,\n\nwhich is the outer bounds of the government\n\nspeech doctrine.  It\u0027s nothing like Summum.\n\nThe City exercised no control.

They say that the record\n\nwill show when it\u0027s developed that the mayor\n\ncame to a lot of these things or some other\n\ngovernmental representative, said that they\u0027re\n\noften in connection with governmental\n\nproclamations, you know, the -- the -- the\n\npeople of Italy or whatever and all that, and\n\nit\u0027s the Italian flag. Does that change your\n\nanalysis about whether it\u0027s government speech\n\nor not?  In other words, it\u0027s in conjunction\n\nwith other governmental activities.\n\nMR.

HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe sole issue here is whether the\n\nCity\u0027s decision to lower Boston\u0027s flag from the\n\nCity Hall flagpole and raise another in its\n\nplace is the City\u0027s own speech. If so, then,\n\nas Summum held, the City is free to select the\n\nviews it wants to express.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"45","file_name":"Shurtleff v.
