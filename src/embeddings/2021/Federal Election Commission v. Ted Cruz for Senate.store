It imposes\n\ninsubstantial burdens on the financing of\n\nelectoral campaigns, and it targets a practice\n\nthat has significant corruptive potential.

say those funds were available for\n\nuse and we didn\u0027t attempt to trace the money\n\nbecause it was -- money is fungible and there\n\nwas no point to it.\n\nBut, again, all that doesn\u0027t go to the\n\nself-inflicted character of the injury. And\n\nimagine a tort suit in which a plaintiff said\n\nit came to my attention that McDonald\u0027s was\n\nselling dangerously hot coffee, and so I went\n\nto McDonald\u0027s and bought a cup of coffee and\n\npoured it upon myself, and I\u0027m suing for costs\n\nof medical treatment and for pain and\n\nsuffering, and I stipulate that my only reason\n\nfor buying the coffee and my only reason for\n\npouring it on myself was to facilitate this\n\nlawsuit.\n\nI think we\u0027d all have the strong\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial\n\nreaction that suit can\u0027t go forward.  And I\n\nthink the best doctrinal basis for saying that\n\nthe suit can\u0027t go forward is, even if we take\n\nas true the allegation that McDonald\u0027s was\n\nbehaving negligently by selling the coffee, the\n\nplaintiff\u0027s own deliberate conduct in visiting\n\ninjury upon herself solely in order to\n\nfacilitate a lawsuit severed the causal link\n\nbetween any wrongdoing and her ultimate injury.\n\nAnd that\u0027s basically what the Court\n\nsaid in Clapper.

COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe government\u0027s arguments against\n\nSenator Cruz\u0027s standing are meritless.\n\nFirst, even assuming, as the\n\ngovernment claims, that Cruz\u0027s $10,000 injury\n\nwas directly caused by the 20-day regulation\n\nand not by operation of Section 304 itself, the\n\ngovernment cannot escape the fact that the\n\n20-day rule is parasitic to Section 304. It\n\nhas no life independent of the authorizing\n\nstatute.  And so, if Section 304 is invalid,\n\nthen the 20-day rule is per force also invalid.\n\nNor does it matter whether Cruz\u0027s\n\n$10,000 injury was self-inflicted.  At least\n\nsince Mr. Plessy sat down in the train car\n\nreserved for whites, this Court has repeatedly\n\nheld that a plaintiff who deliberately subjects\n\nhimself to the injury of unconstitutional\n\ngovernment action for the admitted purpose of\n\nchallenging it has created his standing, not\n\ndefeated it.\n\nOn the merits, the government defends\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n44\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"37","file_name":"Federal Election Commission v.

304 as a measure that serves to protect\n\nagainst what it says is the special threat of\n\nquid pro quo corruption from the use of\n\npost-election contributions to repay candidate\n\nloans.\n\nBut Section 304 permits up to $250,000\n\nworth of such post-election contributions.  So,\n\naccording to the government, Congress\n\neffectively gives a corruption hall pass to the\n\nfirst 86 donors who max out after an election\n\nbut abruptly closes the corrupt -- corruption\n\nwindow on donor number 87.\n\nThat incongruity alone -- and there\n\nare many others -- betrays the genuine and\n\nillegitimate purpose of the loan repayment\n\nlimit.

We\u0027re not prepared to\n\nconcede that the FEC regulation is invalid, but\n\nAppellees did challenge that in this lawsuit;\n\nthat is, at page 26 of the Joint Appendix,\n\nCount 4 of Appellees\u0027 complaint alleged that\n\nthe 20-day limit in the regulation was\n\narbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance\n\nwith law, and Count 5 asserted a different\n\nnon-constitutional challenge to the regulation.\n\nAnd the three-judge district court\n\nexercised supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\nregulatory challenges but held them in abeyance\n\nwhile it adjudicated the constitutional\n\nchallenge to the statute, and I think that was\n\nfor two reasons.\n\nFirst, the district court was under\n\nthe misimpression that the statute itself was\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n83\n\nOfficial\n\nthe current legal barrier to full repayment.\n\nAnd, second, the three-judge court\n\nunderstandably viewed its mandate as being the\n\nresolution of challenges to the\n\nconstitutionality of the statute.  And then,\n\nhaving held that the statute was\n\nunconstitutional, it said we\u0027re dismissing the\n\nregulatory claims as moot.\n\nThe implication was, if the statute\n\nhad been held constitutional, then the court\n\nwould have proceeded to the reg- -- the\n\nnon-constitutional challenges to the regulatory\n\nprovisions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"73","file_name":"Federal Election Commission v.

third thing I wanted to say is\n\nabout the leveling the playing field.\n\nThe\n\ncompanion provision that was at issue in Davis,\n\nthere was a leveling purpose apparent on the\n\nface of the statute because the statute said,\n\nif one candidate spends a lot of his own money,\n\nthen the other candidate will be able to raise\n\nmore money himself.  And so the rules that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n86\n\nOfficial\n\napplied to one candidate were kind of\n\ncontingent on what the other candidate did.\n\nThat was leveling on its face, but\n\nthere\u0027s nothing similar going on here.\n\nThe -- yes, it\u0027s true that the loan\n\nrepayment limit applies to each candidate in\n\nthe race, but the rules that apply to one\n\ncandidate don\u0027t depend on what his opponent\n\ndoes.\n\nThe other thing about the fact that\n\nthe loan repayment limit applies to losing\n\ncandidates, I\u0027d say three things.\n\nThe first is what Justice Sotomayor\n\nsaid, that it doesn\u0027t have much practical\n\nimpact on losing candidates because they can\n\nrarely raise sufficient post-election\n\ncontributions to be over the limit.\n\nThe second thing is that, as we see in\n\nDavis, ordinarily, the presumption is that the\n\nsame rules will apply to all candidates in a\n\nrace, and, indeed, there can be constitutional\n\nproblems if -- even if they don\u0027t.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"76","file_name":"Federal Election Commission v.
