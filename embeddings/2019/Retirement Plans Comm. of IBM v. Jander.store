CLEMENT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn Dudenhoeffer, this Court\n\narticulated a pleading standard that recognized\n\nthat disclosure of negative inside information\n\nby insider fiduciaries could harm the plan and\n\nplan participants by immediately reducing the\n\nvalue of the fund. This Court thus required the\n\nplaintiffs to identify a specific alternative\n\ncourse of conduct that could not do more harm\n\nthan good to the fund as a whole.\n\nHere, Respondents allege that insider\n\nfiduciaries should have taken inside corporate\n\ninformation, disclosed it through the regular\n\ncorporate disclosure channels because disclosure\n\nwas inevitable and the harms from concealment\n\nonly grow over time.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nThere are two basic problems with that\n\nsubmission.

There\u0027s what\n\nyou expect the fiduciary to be doing and then\n\nwhat you expect the corporation and the\n\ncorporate officers to be doing.\n\nWith respect to the fiduciaries, when\n\nit comes to an ESOP, what you really expect them\n\nto be doing is not much, because, if they do\n\nanything with inside information to try to\n\nbenefit the plan participants and not the market\n\nas a whole, they run --\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, there, they\u0027re\n\nwearing their corporate hat. As an ESOP, they\n\nare charged with exercising due diligence and\n\ncare for -- as a fiduciary. Wherever they\n\nsecure the knowledge from, there\u0027s no case that\n\nsays where you secure the knowledge from defines\n\nyour duty. How you act may define your duty in\n\nyour corporate hat or in your ESOP hat, but not\n\nwhere your knowledge comes from.\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor,\n\nit would require an extension of Pegram to say\n\nthat there\u0027s no obligation to use the inside\n\ninformation gained in a corporate capacity in a\n\nfiduciary capacity.
