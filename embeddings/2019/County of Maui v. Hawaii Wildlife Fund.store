LIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThis case is not about whether the\n\nreleases from Maui\u0027s underground injection wells\n\nshould be regulated at all but how. They are\n\nalready regulated under several existing state\n\nand federal environmental programs, including\n\nthe Clean Water Act\u0027s nonpoint source program.\n\nBut is a Clean Water Act point source permit\n\nalso required? The question is where the line\n\nfalls between the Clean Water Act\u0027s federal\n\npoint source program and its state law nonpoint\n\nsource program.\n\nAnd the answer is in the text.

STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe first point I\u0027d like to make about\n\nthe -- the definition of discharge of a\n\npollutant is that the combination of the words\n\n\"to\" and \"from\" import more than either term in\n\nisolation; that the statute defines the term\n\n\"discharge of a pollutant\" to mean any addition\n\nof a pollutant to navigable waters or to the\n\nocean from a point source.\n\nAnd, for example, if at my home I pour\n\nwhiskey from a bottle into a flask and then I\n\nbring the flask to a party at a different\n\nlocation and I pour whiskey into the punch bowl\n\nthere, nobody would say that I had added whiskey\n\nto the punch from the bottle.\n\nIt would be true that the punch --\n\nthat the whiskey originated in the bottle, its\n\nroute was fairly traceable from the bottle to\n\nthe punch bowl, and it wound up in the punch\n\nbowl, but you wouldn\u0027t say it was added to the\n\npunch from the bottle.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"19","file_name":"County of Maui v.

The\n\nword \"directly\" is nowhere in the text.\n\nRather, all that\u0027s required is that\n\nthe pollutants be from a point source. The Act\n\nexpressly defines \"point source\" to include\n\nwells, and the common use of \"from\" is to\n\nindicate the starting point, cause, or source of\n\nsomething.

HENKIN: Well, Justice Breyer, we\n\ncould certainly embrace functional equivalent,\n\nbecause there\u0027s no question that Congress\n\nintended to regulate discharges whether it goes\n\nthrough the air.  Now everyone -- everyone here\n\nagrees that the air is not a point source, but\n\neveryone also agrees if the point source\n\ndischarges into the river, through the air, it\u0027s\n\ncovered.\n\nWe and the United States agree that if\n\nit also flows over the land, which is also not\n\ncovered by the Clean Water Act, it\u0027s covered.\n\nAnd I would -- I would -- I would submit that\n\nthere\u0027s nothing in the language of the statute\n\nthat exempts point source discharge just because\n\nit touches a little bit of groundwater.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"42","file_name":"County of Maui v.
