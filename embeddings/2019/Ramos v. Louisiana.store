And we\n\nthink for three reasons the state has over-read\n\nthe drafting history.\n\nFirst, as the Court itself said in\n\ncases dealing with provisions like the Second\n\nAmendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause, we do\n\nnot read into a deletion of language any meaning\n\nwhen there\u0027s no contemporary evidence that it\n\nwas designed to change the meaning of the\n\nprovision.\n\nAnd that\u0027s all the more true here\n\nbecause of the contextual backdrop. The state\n\ntalks about the fact that many states at the\n\ntime had trial by jury provisions in their own\n\nconstitutions and correctly notes that some of\n\nthose provisions explicitly required unanimity\n\nbut some of them didn\u0027t.\n\nAnd the rule was the same across all","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"3","file_name":"Ramos v.

And that\u0027s very different than a\n\n6/0 verdict when it comes to the way things\n\nhappen in the jury room and the public\n\nconfidence in that verdict.\n\nAnd I\u0027ll also give you a practical\n\nanswer to your question. When Louisiana was\n\nconsidering changing its law, and, indeed, did\n\nchange its law, which I would say\n\nparenthetically is also something that I think\n\nshould be taken into account when it comes to\n\nstare decisis, that Louisiana has even changed\n\nits law, but during those deliberations there\n\nwas a prosecutor who testified before the\n\nlegislature and said that he used to sometimes\n\ncharge felonies instead of misdemeanors because\n\nit was easier to get a 10-2 verdict than it was\n\nto get a 6-0 verdict.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"15","file_name":"Ramos v.

Before Apodaca, the Court had\n\nsquarely held in Andres in the 1940s that the\n\nSixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict.\n\nAnd it had said it many other times, but I think\n\nin that case, it was integral to the holding.\n\nAnd so what I understood the four-justice\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nplurality to be saying in Apodaca was doing what\n\nJustice White had said in a footnote in Duncan\n\nit could do, which is reconsider the old\n\nprecedents.\n\nBut even if I didn\u0027t have that, I\n\nwould have the five votes in Apodaca, Justice\n\nGinsburg, and the statements in cases like\n\nRichard and Descamps later, where the Court has\n\ncited Justice Powell\u0027s opinion as the law and\n\nsaid that it settles the Sixth Amendment\n\nquestion.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nMs. Murrill.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH MURRILL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMS. MURRILL: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nWe agree with Petitioner that this\n\ncase presents two issues: whether the Sixth\n\nAmendment requires unanimity and, if so, whether\n\nthat requirement applies to the states.\n\nThe Court should decide this case on\n\nthe first issue because nothing in the text,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"28","file_name":"Ramos v.

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nFISHER: Thank you.\n\nI\u0027d like to\n\nmake a couple of quick factual points and then\n\ntalk about stare decisis and reliance.\n\nJustice Breyer, you asked a couple of\n\nquestions about numbers and facts. So we say in\n\nour reply brief, using one of the state\u0027s own\n\nfilings, that there are 36 cases on direct\n\nreview right now in Louisiana where this issue\n\nhas been presented.\n\nAnd then even within those 36 is --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n64\n\nOfficial\n\neven within that 36 you\u0027re going to have\n\narguments about whether it was adequately\n\npreserved and all the rest. And so we think, at\n\nleast in the direct review level, the numbers\n\nare actually quite modest and low.\n\nAnd as the Court has described\n\nthroughout the -- the last half of the argument,\n\nthe retroactivity questions can be left for\n\nanother day and covered by their own reliance\n\ndoctrines.\n\nYou also asked about Puerto Rico.\n\nIn Footnote 10 of our brief, we note\n\nthat the Court held in Balzac that the right to\n\njury trial does not apply the same way in Puerto\n\nRico as to the states. And so that would be a\n\nquestion about the Insular Cases. You\u0027re going\n\nto be talking about that next week, perhaps.\n\nBut it\u0027s something that this case\n\ndoesn\u0027t -- doesn\u0027t necessarily address.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"58","file_name":"Ramos v.
