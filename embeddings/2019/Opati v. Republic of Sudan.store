McGILL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. McGILL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSudan provided Al Qaeda with a safe\n\nhaven and vital material support enabling it to\n\ncarry out the embassy bombings, killing 224\n\npeople and wounding thousands more.  In\n\nretaliation, President Clinton sent 13 cruise\n\nmissiles into Khartoum.  But to impose punitive\n\ndamages, Sudan argues, somehow would violate\n\nprinciples of fundamental fairness embodied in\n\nthe Landgraf presumption.\n\nIf fairness is the issue here, then\n\nSudan surely should lose. The State Department\n\nhad designated Sudan as a state sponsor of\n\nterrorism in 1993, but Sudan continued to\n\nshelter Osama Bin Laden even as he issued\n\nfatwahs calling for attacks on U.S. interests.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Opati v.

Review\n\nNow, turning to the key retroactivity\n\npoint, here our position, of course, is Landgraf\n\ncontrols this case.  Altmann is not on point\n\nbecause when Altmann was decided, the FSIA was\n\nstrictly a jurisdictional statute, essentially.\n\nI do know it was complicated by the\n\nVerlinden decision, which said it established\n\nsome substantive aspects of federal common law.\n\nBut, in any event, Altmann was limited to the\n\nFSIA as it existed at the time, and that was\n\npre-2008.\n\nFootnote 15 of Altmann and the text\n\naccompanying that specifically say that we\u0027re\n\nnot dealing here in Altmann with a cause of\n\naction, the creation of a cause of action or the\n\nmodification of a cause of action, because if we\n\nwere, we\u0027d have to be concerned with Landgraf\n\nand Landgraf\u0027s progeny, including the Hughes\n\ncase.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Curran,\n\nassuming Landgraf controls, why isn\u0027t it met","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"26","file_name":"Opati v.
