STRIS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nMy clients are beneficiaries of a\n\npension trust. We allege that the trustees,\n\nthrough disloyalty and imprudence, caused the\n\ntrust to lose $750 million. The suit presents a\n\njusticiable case or controversy for three\n\nreasons:\n\nFirst, my clients have an equitable\n\ninterest in all assets of their pension trust.\n\nThat is a property interest. And when $750\n\nmillion of that property was lost, my clients\n\nsuffered a concrete injury.\n\nRespondents are between a rock and a\n\nhard place. They can\u0027t argue that participants\n\nhave an equitable interest in only some of the\n\ntrust corpus, because the trust is unsegregated\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nand undivided.

If\n\nyou read the treatises, even discretionary\n\nbeneficiaries could sue a trustee for breach of\n\ntrust. These are beneficiaries who have\n\nabsolutely no entitlement to any trust assets,\n\nexcept those that the trustee in his own\n\ndiscretion will give to the beneficiary.\n\nNevertheless, a breach of trust would allow the\n\nbeneficiary to sue that very trustee.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n23\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nThat history, I think, decides this\n\ncase.

One is this Court has\n\nand -- and certainly the \"no further inquiry\"\n\ncases made clear that even when the trust\n\nbenefits from a particular breach of duty, you\n\nstill have standing, if you will, to sue.\n\nAnd, you know, one case out of many\n\nthat we cited is Magruder against Drury.
