On burdens, it\n\nfound that Act 620 would leave Louisiana with\n\njust one clinic and one doctor providing\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nabortions.

RIKELMAN:  This Court has allowed\n\nthird-party standing in cases where the law\n\ndirectly regulates the plaintiff without a\n\nshowing of hindrance.  For instance, in Craig\n\nversus Boren, there was clearly no hindrance.\n\nBut I would also say that the Court\n\ndoesn\u0027t need to reach these issues here because\n\nthe state strategically and deliberately waived\n\nthird-party standing.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I think that\u0027s\n\nhighly debatable that they waived it.

Their claims also fail for an independent\n\nreason.\n\nSo they do not meet the modern,\n\nrigorous rule for third-party standing.  So,\n\ninstead, they invite this Court to exempt them\n\nfrom the rule.\n\nThis Court should decline to make\n\nabortion providers unique among federal\n\nplaintiffs and reaffirm that even abortion\n\nproviders must comply with the same rules as all\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"28","file_name":"June Medical Services L.L.C. v.

RIKELMAN:  Your Honor, the lack of\n\nbenefits of these laws is not state-dependent.\n\nThe medical consensus is clear that in no state\n\ndo they serve health and safety benefits.\n\nAnd, in fact, even the federal\n\ngovernment a few months ago removed an admitting\n\nprivileges requirement from its regulations of\n\nsurgery centers nationwide, finding that the\n\nrequirement is medically unnecessary and imposes\n\nburdens.\n\nAnd as Justice Kagan asked, this Court\n\nrejected an alleged credentialing benefit in\n\nWhole Woman\u0027s Health.  And after holding a\n\ntrial, the district court rejected that this law\n\nwould serve a credentialing benefit in\n\nLouisiana.\n\nWith respect to burdens, the district\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"62","file_name":"June Medical Services L.L.C. v.
