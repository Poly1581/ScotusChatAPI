So it authorizes the\n\nagencies to require most employers to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage while exempting a small\n\nnumber of employers who have sincere\n\nconscientious objections.\n\nBut it doesn\u0027t create an\n\nall-or-nothing choice: require coverage for\n\neveryone or no one.  Otherwise, the\n\nlong-standing church exemption, the effective\n\nexemption for self-insured church plans, and,\n\nindeed, Respondents\u0027 understanding of the\n\naccommodation itself would also violate the\n\nstatute since the employers\u0027 group health plans\n\ndon\u0027t provide the mandated coverage.\n\nSecond, RFRA at the very least\n\nauthorizes the religious exemption.  It\n\nprohibits the government from imposing a\n\nsubstantial burden on religious beliefs subject\n\nto a discretionary exception.

suggest that HCRA has almost\n\nunlimited authority to both create guidelines\n\nand exceptions from those guidelines.\n\nFirst, if you would give us just an\n\nidea of what standards are to guide

First, because HRSA has the\n\ndiscretion not to require any contraceptive\n\ncoverage at all, as this Court acknowledged in\n\nHobby Lobby, I think that that plainly\n\nencompasses the discretion to require coverage\n\nby most employers but not the small number with\n\nsincere conscientious objections.\n\nSecondly, it\u0027s further constrained by\n\nthe APA\u0027s requirement for reasoned\n\ndecision-making which prohibits arbitrary --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n13\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nwhich would prohibit arbitrary exemptions.\n\nAnd, third, I think that the term\n\n\"preventive services\" in the statute itself\n\npotentially provides yet another limitation\n\nsince, at the very least, that would encompass\n\nthe types of things that governments\n\ntraditionally take into account when regulating\n\nin this area, including the impact that their","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"9","file_name":"Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v.

I had exactly the same question as\n\nJustice Thomas\u0027s first question, so -- about\n\nwhat are the standards that govern when the\n\nagency can make exceptions and how and what they\n\nmust look like.\n\nSo, if you have anything to add on\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n15\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthat, do. And, if not, thank you very much and\n\nyou can go on to the next question.\n\nGENERAL FRANCISCO:  Your Honor, the\n\nonly thing I would add is that I think all of\n\nthese limitations would fully make sure that any\n\ntime that HRSA\u0027s exercising its discretion, it\u0027s\n\ndoing so in a rational way.\n\nAfter all, this is the very same\n\ndiscretion that was used not just to adopt the\n\nchurch exemption but also the effective\n\nexemption for self-insured church plans, and,\n\nunder Respondents\u0027 understanding of the\n\naccommodation, even the accommodation itself,\n\nsince, in each one of those three instances, the\n\nemployers\u0027 benefits plan is not providing the\n\nmandated coverage and, in two of them, nobody is\n\nproviding the mandated coverage.\n\nAnd so, if you concluded that the\n\nagencies didn\u0027t have this discretion, that would\n\nundermine the validity of the church exemption,\n\nthe effective exemption for self-insured church\n\nplans, and potentially the accommodation more\n\nbroadly.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"11","file_name":"Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v.

preventive\n\nservices would have to be covered by an\n\ninsurance plan?  For example, could it take cost\n\ninto account?\n\nGENERAL FRANCISCO:  Well, Your Honor,\n\nif it took cost into account, I think that the\n\nquestion -- the first question would be whether\n\nthe manner in which it took cost into account\n\nsatisfied the arbitrary and capricious standard.\n\nAnd I certainly do think that they\n\ncould take cost into account in deciding what\n\ntypes of preventative services to require.  If,\n\nfor example, there was a particular type of\n\npreventative service that was a new technology\n\nthat was actually quite -- quite helpful, but it\n\nwas cost-prohibitive for just about every\n\nemployer or any insurance company to cover, I\n\ncertainly think that HRSA could take that into\n\naccount in deciding whether or not to require\n\nit, pursuant to the guidelines issued under\n\nSection 13(a)(4).\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  This broad issue has\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"12","file_name":"Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v.

And I think it\u0027s important\n\nto remember just how broad these rules are.\n\nFirst of all, there are two rules that\n\nwe\u0027re dealing with.  One that we haven\u0027t talked\n\nabout as much is the moral rule that simply says\n\nan employer with a moral objection to providing\n\ncontraception can be completely exempted.\n\nThe district court noted this could,\n\nin theory, allow an employer that objects to\n\nwomen in the workforce, for instance, to remove\n\nitself from providing contraception.\n\nAnd with respect to the religious\n\nexemption, you know, there are certain key\n\nfeatures that really show how broad this is.\n\nFirst of all, it eliminates the accommodation as\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\na mandatory requirement.

They argued good\n\ncause. In one instance, the D.C. Circuit upheld\n\nthat finding.

number of my colleagues have\n\npointed out, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor,\n\nAlito, Breyer and others, there are very strong\n\ninterests on both sides here, which is what\n\nmakes the case
