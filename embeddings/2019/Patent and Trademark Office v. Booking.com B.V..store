The first is that we\n\nagree that in the ordinary case, one might use\n\nthe term \"generic\" to refer, or to understand\n\nit, how the -- the consumers generally refer to\n\na class of goods, but I think it can also be\n\nused, as this Court\u0027s decision in Goodyear used\n\nit, for how a specific entity or how the public\n\nwould understand a specific term.\n\nSo, for example, in Goodyear, the\n\nCourt held that Goodyear, Inc. could not be, or\n\nWine, Inc., for example, could not be\n\ntrademarked, and that\u0027s true even though nobody\n\nrefers to a class of Wine, Incorporated.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"6","file_name":"Patent and Trademark Office v.

Is that so?\n\nMS. ROSS: So, Justice Ginsburg, I\n\nthink Respondent suggests that there are far\n\nmore than there actually are. If I can make\n\njust a few points on this. The first is that\n\nthe TTAB, which is how the PTO speaks\n\nprecedentially, has been consistent on this\n\npoint, and the examiner decisions in our\n\nappendix as well as the courts of appeals other\n\nthan the court below.\n\nSo, by and large, our rule is being\n\nfollowed out in the world, so I don\u0027t think that\n\nthere is going to be this huge change.\n\nNow Respondent does point to some\n\nexamples, but I think those examples show a few\n\nflaws. One of those flaws is that Respondent\n\nseems to think that on our rule, the combination\n\nof any two nouns or any noun and an \"Inc.\"\n\ndesignation is always going to be generic.\n\nThat\u0027s simply not true. You always have to look\n\nat how the two terms are being used.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"11","file_name":"Patent and Trademark Office v.

Okay? Again, I\n\n-- I -- I know you want us to go there. But put\n\nthat aside for the moment. What would you have\n\nthe Court say?\n\nMS. ROSS: Certainly. So I would want\n\nthe Court to recognize, as the Lanham Act, I\n\nthink, commands, again, in Sections 1052 E and\n\nF, that generic terms generally are not\n\nsusceptible to trademark registration based on\n\nsecondary meaning.\n\nAnd so Respondent, like all generic\n\n.coms, would have to come forward with some\n\nevidence other than simply this secondary idea\n\nthat, yes, this is a -- a term that just tells\n\nme that it\u0027s an on-line booking agency, but\n\nconsumers have come to understand it as\n\nsomething else.\n\nI think blurring that distinction can\n\nhave really bad consequences outside of the .com","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"29","file_name":"Patent and Trademark Office v.

I think that,\n\nyou know, my first-line answer, of course, is\n\nthat we think that the tools are sufficient.\n\nThey just point in our direction.\n\nNow I -- I think that the fact that\n\ngeneric terms can\u0027t be trademarked even upon a\n\nshowing of secondary meaning under the Lanham\n\nAct is itself enough to resolve this case.\n\nNow, moving on from there, you know,\n\nyou mentioned the risk of confusion analysis. I\n\nthink it\u0027s notable that Respondent in their\n\nbrief says we should get a -- a trademark on\n\nBooking.com, but if ebooking.com comes -- and a\n\nlarge part of that is because we\u0027re unique --\n\nbut, if ebooking.com comes along, we should win\n\nin a risk of confusion analysis because we were\n\nhere first.\n\nNow I think if it\u0027s sort of good for\n\nthe goose, good for the gander, if ebooking --\n\nor if Booking.com gets trademark protection\n\nbecause it\u0027s unique, then it seems as though\n\nebooking.com should get equal protection because\n\nit, too, is unique.

Second, the\n\nAct abrogated Goodyear. And, third, this test\n\nfurthers the statutory purpose to let consumers\n\ndecide which marks deserve trademark protection.\n\nFirst, the text. The Act has always\n\nrequired, in Sections 1052, 1091, and 1127,\n\ntrademark registration if a mark helps consumers\n\ndistinguish among brands. In other words, the\n\nAct protects descriptive names, which consumers\n\nfind useful, but it excludes generic ones, which\n\nconsumers think just refer to a genus. The\n\nLanham Act thus codified the law of unfair\n\ncompetition, which had protected descriptive but\n\nnot generic names.\n\nAnd right before Congress passed the\n\nAct, this Court in Kellogg adopted the primary\n\nsignificance test under unfair competition law\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"36","file_name":"Patent and Trademark Office v.

you, counsel.\n\nYou rely heavily on the primary\n\nsignificance test, but that is only in the\n\nprovision of the statute dealing with\n\ncancellation of marks.

So why should we assume that the primary\n\nsignificance test carries the weight that you\n\nwould give it?\n\nMS. BLATT: Sure. So, like I just\n\nsaid, the -- 1064, we think, is a ratification\n\nof the law as if you\u0027re looking at the dividing\n\nline between what\u0027s a generic term and what\u0027s a\n\ndescriptive term. And the specific amendment\n\nwas to overrule a decision that had come up in\n\nthe cancellation context, so it was targeted to\n\nthat Ninth Circuit anti-monopoly case.\n\nIn terms of the primary significance\n\ntest, though, if you ignore Section 1064, there\n\nis still no other test than other than one that\n\ndecides -- that looks to what consumers think of\n\nthe mark, because three provisions, regardless\n\nof 1064, require registration of marks that help\n\nconsumers distinguish among brands.
