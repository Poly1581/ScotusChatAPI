The decision below must be\n\nreversed because the text makes clear that\n\nCongress never terminated the Creek reservation\n\nand never transferred federal criminal\n\njurisdiction to Oklahoma.\n\nI have four basic points to make this\n\nmorning. First, the Creek Nation had a\n\nreservation. The relevant treaties reserved the\n\nlands from sale and solemnly guaranteed the\n\nlands for the Creek to govern.

First, of course, is that the\n\ntribe was not absent from the land in the same\n\nway that the tribe was in Parker.\n\nSecond, the land here was allotted in\n\n-- almost entirely to the tribe -- to tribal\n\nmembers themselves, to Indians.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"6","file_name":"McGirt v.

Because,\n\nin that new treaty in 1866, it grants\n\nrights-of-way to railroads, the railroads lead\n\nto settlements, the settlements lead to new\n\ntowns that are predominantly white. So, by\n\n1890, you have an odd situation of an Indian\n\nterritory nominally that\u0027s predominantly white.\n\nSo Congress\u0027s options at that time are\n\n-- are to remove the -- the whites, to remove\n\nthe Indians. Neither of those was going to\n\nhappen. So the other remaining options were\n\ntribal government over non-Indians, which, of\n\ncourse, is contrary to tradition, or to create a\n\nnew state.

First, there is\n\nnothing radical about the Parker/Solem\n\nframework.

passed legislation\n\nat the turn of the prior century saying that the\n\nUnited States laws and the laws of Arkansas,\n\nwhich would be applied in Oklahoma, would apply\n\nto all persons therein, irrespective of race.\n\nNow, if you prevail, the laws in the\n\neastern half of Oklahoma will be different. The\n\napplicable law will be different, dependent upon\n\nrace. So how is that consistent with Congress\u0027s\n\nlegislation?\n\nMR. KANJI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice. It\u0027s a critical question. What the\n\n1897 statute did was to apply federal law,\n\nirrespective of race, the territorial law and\n\nArkansas law as assimilated.\n\nThere was nothing radical about that.\n\nUnder the General Crimes Act and the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAssimilative Crimes Act, state law was often\n\napplied where federal law did not exist.\n\nBut then what happens, of course, is\n\nthis watershed moment of statehood, and\n\nstatehood always changes the status quo. And\n\nwhen it comes to Indians, what it does typically\n\nis reserves federal power over the Indians\n\nwhile, of course, giving state power over\n\nnon-Indians to the states.\n\nAnd there\u0027s nothing in the Enabling\n\nAct or the Five Tribes Act that suggests that\n\nthat status quo, the normal way of dealing with\n\nit, was supposed to be departed from.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"25","file_name":"McGirt v.

Review\n\nasked before, but what are -- what are the\n\ncongressional prescriptions that, in Oklahoma,\n\nall residents are subject to the same law,\n\nirrespective of race?\n\nMR. MANSINGHANI: I think that lays\n\nthe framework of what Congress was trying to do\n\nin make -- in -- in creating the State of\n\nOklahoma, which was to transform the governance\n\nof the state and the land ownership of the\n\nstate, which was exclusively tribal, to a place\n\nwhere both Indians and non-Indians could both\n\nown land and be governed by the same state\n\ngovernment.\n\nIf you look at pages 23 -- 22 to 25 of\n\nour brief, we lay out that history and -- and\n\nlay out that that is what Congress said\n\nexplicitly in legislative reports, that\u0027s what\n\nthe Dallas Commission report said, and that\u0027s\n\nwhat the tribes recognize in their own tribal\n\nunderstanding.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\n\nBreyer?\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, thank you.\n\nI\u0027ll -- I\u0027ll pass.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nJustice Alito?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"46","file_name":"McGirt v.

We have currently over 1700\n\ninmates whose crimes were committed in the\n\nformer Indian territory who identify as Native\n\nAmerican.

I want to\n\npick up on your comment earlier that Congress\n\nmade clear that Indians and non-Indians were to\n\nbe treated alike, and to pick up on Justice\n\nGorsuch\u0027s reference to demographics, and follow\n\nup on what I said in my earlier questions.\n\nMy understanding is that, as of 1890,\n\nthis was a very unusual situation because it was\n\nalready predominantly non-Indian in Indian\n\nterritory, and that put Congress in a very\n\ndifficult position of figuring out what to do.\n\nAnd I think that is necessary to understand to\n\nfigure out what the text of these statutes mean.\n\nSo I -- I guess my question on\n\ndemographics is people talk about the\n\ndemographics now. The demographics in 1890 were\n\nalso similar. How should that affect what we\u0027re\n\nthinking about? And, more particularly, can you\n\nconnect that up to the text of the statutes that\n\nCongress enacted in that 17-year period to\n\ntransition to statehood?\n\nMR.

My\n\nunderstanding, however, was that the 1866 treaty\n\nmade clear that those treaty rights were, I\n\ndon\u0027t know if the word is superseded, but\n\ndiminished because the tribes had aligned and\n\nmade a treaty with the confederates --\n\nConfederate States of America, and the treaty\n\nlanguage in 1866 said that that had unsettled\n\nthe treaty relations.\n\nAnything you want to add on the 1866\n\ntreaty, the relevance of that?\n\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yeah, I -- I don\u0027t\n\nthink it adds significantly to the point, except\n\nthat it -- it reflected an assertion of a\n\ngreater federal responsibility in the territory.\n\nAnd it was contemplated that Congress could pass\n\nlaws governing the territory.\n\nI did want to make one point about\n\npractical consequences on the criminal side.\n\nNot only would -- would this jeopardize all the\n\nprior convictions on the state side, but it\n\nwould impose great burdens on the federal\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"77","file_name":"McGirt v.
