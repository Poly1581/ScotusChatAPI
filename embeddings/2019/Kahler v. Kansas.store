CROUSE: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nPetitioner asked this Court to define\n\na rule of insanity and to require the states to\n\nimplement that rule in its criminal justice\n\nproceedings.  But, as this Court indicated in\n\nPowell, nearly 50 years ago, nothing would be\n\nless fruitful than for this Court to select a\n\nrigid rule of constitutional law of insanity.\n\nAnd that admonition rings as true today as it\n\ndid 50 years ago.\n\nThe first thing I\u0027d like to talk about\n\nis that it\u0027s not deeply rooted.  The right\n\nversus wrong test is a relatively recent\n\nvintage.  The historical basis for it started\n\nsomewhere around the 1800s; and, therefore, it\u0027s\n\nnot deeply rooted.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"26","file_name":"Kahler v.

CROUSE: So obviously a different\n\nquestion and I think it also engenders a\n\ndifferent test.  I think that -- that, if you\u0027re\n\nconsidering what is available at the sentencing,\n\nfor whether it violates the constitution, would\n\nimplicate the Eighth Amendment.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let\u0027s put the\n\nEighth Amendment to the side.

The law\n\nhas many, many ways of, in different\n\ncircumstances, trying to separate out\n\nindividuals for whom the criminal justice system\n\nis just not going to work in terms of\n\npreventing, et cetera, the crimes.\n\nOne, the wind blew my arm.  Okay?\n\nTwo, duress, because in a duress case you\u0027re\n\nlooking to see could the -- could the defendant\n\nhave done otherwise.\n\nWith insanity you\u0027re close to that.\n\nOften it\u0027s a question of could the defendant\n\nhave done otherwise.\n\nAnd even where not, it is is this\n\nindividual so different from an ordinary\n\nindividual that it just doesn\u0027t make sense to\n\napply the law?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"52","file_name":"Kahler v.

SCHRUP: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  I\u0027d like to make three quick points:\n\nFirst, the problem with the mens rea\n\napproach, to get to Justice Breyer and\n\nSotomayor\u0027s point, is that it scrapes out the\n\nwhy, the underlying motivation fueled by mental\n\nillness that explains a defendant\u0027s act.  And\n\nthat has been a part of our history for\n\ncenturies.\n\nAnd that gets to the dog or the dog\n\nexample.  It\u0027s completely arbitrary.  I don\u0027t\n\nknow why if you think -- why one defendant who\n\nthinks that a dog, he\u0027s shooting a dog, versus\n\nanother one who thinks a dog is ordering him to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\nshoot someone else, makes any difference\n\nwhatsoever.  The first person is acquitted and\n\nlet out on the streets and the second is put in\n\njail and maybe put to death.\n\nThe second piece of this -- and so\n\nthere\u0027s no safety net, basically.
