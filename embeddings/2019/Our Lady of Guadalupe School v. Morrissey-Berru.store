RATNER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThere are three proposed approaches to\n\nthe ministerial exception on the table. First,\n\nin most lower courts, an employee\u0027s function has\n\nbeen central to the analysis.\n\nSecond, in the Ninth Circuit, an\n\nemployer must check off one or more formalities\n\neven if an employee\u0027s religious function is\n\nclear.\n\nAnd, third, in Respondents\u0027 view, this\n\nCourt should go even further and make formality\n\nthe key, with function serving just as a\n\ncross-check.\n\nThe first approach is the right one.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n29\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nThe touchstone of the ministerial exception\n\nshould be whether an employee performs important\n\nreligious functions. That\u0027s because function\n\nreflects the First Amendment interest at stake\n\nand because, critically, it\u0027s more neutral among\n\ndifferent religions.\n\nHere, we\u0027re talking about teachers of\n\nreligious doctrine at a religious school.  Under\n\nHosanna-Tabor, those teachers are ministering to\n\ntheir students by teaching them how and why to\n\nbe Catholic. So they should fall within the\n\nministerial exception regardless of what the\n\nschool calls them.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"25","file_name":"Our Lady of Guadalupe School v.

As I understand it, this is --\n\nthe kinds of claims that are brought are not\n\nabout religion.\n\nThere is a BFOQ and there is the\n\nreligious exemption and taken together, where\n\nthe organization does something related to\n\nreligion, and that\u0027s why they dismissed the\n\nperson, they\u0027re likely to win if the case is\n\nbrought in the first place.\n\nWe\u0027re talking about the kinds of\n\nthings anyway that Justice Ginsburg raised.\n\nThat\u0027s the kind of thing. Should there be an\n\nimmunity there? And I think the Court has\n\npreviously decided yes, there should be when the\n\nperson is a minister because, in that situation,\n\ndon\u0027t even get into it, Court, don\u0027t even get\n\ninto it.\n\nSo who falls within the minister?

RATNER: So, Justice Gorsuch, a\n\ncouple points. I think the first, the reason we\n\nhave not advocated for a completely deferential\n\napproach is the reason Petitioners\u0027 counsel\n\nalluded to, and that\u0027s that the ministerial\n\nexception is really a legal term of art. And so\n\ndifferent religions may have different views on\n\nwho constitutes a minister under that particular\n\nfaith, but that\u0027s not necessarily going to map\n\non to the sphere that this Court has said has to\n\nbe left to religious organizations.\n\nSo we don\u0027t think that there\u0027s any way\n\nto entirely extricate yourself from this\n\nproblem.

You\u0027re -- you\u0027re much\n\nmore focused on titles, I would think, than\n\nwhether or not they\u0027re performing religious\n\nfunctions.\n\nAnd my concern is -- it was one raised\n\nby the concurring opinion in Hosanna-Tabor, is\n\nthat different faiths put different stock in --\n\nin titles.
