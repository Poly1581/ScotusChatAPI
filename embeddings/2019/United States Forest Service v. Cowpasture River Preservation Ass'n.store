It\n\ndoes not.\n\nThe Act simply charges the Secretary\n\nof the Interior with overall administration of a\n\ntrail. It repeatedly distinguishes between the\n\nagency administering the trail and the land\n\nmanaging agencies administering the land.  The\n\nPark Service thus coordinates -- or -- agencies\n\nand organizations responsible for their own","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"United States Forest Service v.

Review\n\nour reply brief, that generally speaking if you\n\ngrant a right-of-way, which is one way of\n\nthinking about the trail, it doesn\u0027t affect\n\nsubsurface rights. So that actually does\n\nsupport this way of thinking about it.\n\nBut here\u0027s why we briefed it in the\n\nmore straightforward way that you do have to\n\nmaintain the difference between the trail and\n\nthe lands. And that is because the argument on\n\nthe other side is not limited to the Appalachian\n\nTrail. It\u0027s not even limited to federal lands.\n\nIt says that all of the lands -- because the\n\nPark Service administers the whole trail.  And\n\nit\u0027s not just the Appalachian Trail.  There\u0027s\n\nabout two dozen trails that the Park Service\n\nadministers.\n\nAnd they not only go over bridges and\n\nroads; some of them are downtown. I mean, the\n\nPark Service administers the Selma to Montgomery\n\nNational Historical Trail. Now, if that trail\n\nis lands in the Park Service because we just\n\ncan\u0027t get our head around the idea that trails\n\nare different from land, then parts of downtown\n\nSelma, downtown Montgomery are lands of the\n\nNational Park Service.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"23","file_name":"United States Forest Service v.

I don\u0027t think downtown Kansas\n\nCity or Portland, Oregon are lands in the\n\nNational Park Service.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, could --\n\nif -- if we go back to Justice Alito\u0027s idea,\n\nwhich was also the way I thought about it, that\n\nthat was the way to cut this -- but then I\n\nstarted looking around and the -- the mineral --\n\nI wondered whether you can win under that\n\napproach.\n\nSo here\u0027s is the argument that you\n\ncan\u0027t win under the surface/subsurface approach,\n\nis that -- is that the Mineral Leasing Act gives\n\nthe authority to do rights-of-way, including\n\npipelines, to the -- to the -- to the secretary\n\nthat has -- it talks about the surface. It says\n\nwhere the surface of all the federal lands\n\ninvolved in a proposed right-of-way is under the\n\njurisdiction of one federal agency, the agency\n\nhead is authorized to grant the right-of-way.\n\nSo that suggests under the MLA, that\n\nthe right-of-way, the substratum, is given to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"24","file_name":"United States Forest Service v.

CLEMENT: So if I were going to\n\nwarm to the topic of trying to win this case on\n\nthe alternative ground, what I would tell you\n\nabout that is I would say that\u0027s not how I\n\nactually read the provisions together.  That\u0027s\n\n-- that\u0027s sort of a subsidiary provision that\n\nsays how you deal with pipeline rights-of-way\n\nwhen you have two agencies with jurisdiction\n\nover the surface.  And it uses that formulation,\n\nbut when it\u0027s really trying to figure out what\u0027s\n\nthe right agency head, it asks which agency head\n\nhas jurisdiction over the lands. And I think\n\nthat that -- it doesn\u0027t say surface in that\n\nprovision.  And I think that\u0027s the critical\n\nprovision.\n\nBut with one more word about sort of\n\nthe theory we\u0027ve actually articulated, I do\n\nthink if you look at all of these trails, you\u0027ll\n\nsee why Congress picked a different term.  And I\n\nthink it\u0027s important to know, it\u0027s not like we\n\ndon\u0027t have a term in the statute for the trails.\n\nThey are components in the national trail\n\nsystem.
