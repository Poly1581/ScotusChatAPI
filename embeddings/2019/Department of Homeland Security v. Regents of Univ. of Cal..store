NOEL J. FRANCISCO\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nGENERAL FRANCISCO: Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nIn 2017, the Fifth Circuit held that\n\nDAPA and the expansion of DACA were likely\n\nunlawful, a judgment this Court affirmed by an\n\nequally divided Court. In the face of those\n\ndecisions, the Department of Homeland Security\n\nreasonably determined that it no longer wished\n\nto retain the DACA policy based on its belief\n\nthat the policy was illegal, its serious doubts\n\nabout its illegality, and its general opposition\n\nto broad non-enforcement policies.\n\nThat decision did not violate the APA\n\nfor two reasons. First, it\u0027s not subject to\n\njudicial review. The rescission simply ended a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nprevious non-enforcement policy whereby the\n\nDepartment agreed to not enforce the INA against\n\nhundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.\n\nBut the decision whether or not to\n\nenforce the law is committed to the agency\u0027s\n\nunreviewable discretion, unless a statute\n\nrestricts it. And nothing in the INA requires\n\nthe Department, a law enforcement agency, to not\n\nenforce the law.\n\nSecond, the decision to end this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"3","file_name":"Department of Homeland Security v.

First of all, Secretary Nielsen\u0027s\n\nmemoranda clearly encompasses all of the\n\ndifferent arguments. It sets them forth in\n\ngreat detail. And we think that the Nielsen\n\nmemorandum is clearly properly before the Court.\n\nThe district court in Washington, D.C.,\n\nspecifically asked for it. We specifically\n\nprovided it. The district court reviewed it.\n\nSo the only question really is, what does it\n\nmean?\n\nAnd Secretary Nielsen in her\n\nmemorandum effectively ratified Secretary Duke\u0027s\n\ndecision for the reasons given, using precisely\n\nthe same mechanism that Secretary Duke used\n\nherself to issue the memo in the first place,\n\nthe same mechanism that was issued -- used to\n\nissue the DACA memo, and the same mechanism used\n\nto issue the DAPA memo.\n\nSo this isn\u0027t a post hoc\n\nrationalization of agency action.

even\n\nremotely argue here, under State Farm, that we\n\ncompletely failed to consider an important\n\naspect of the question.\n\nSecondly, I think that Secretary\n\nDuke\u0027s memorandum under the proper standard\n\nclearly satisfies the APA standard for -- for\n\nconsidering reliance interests. She does so\n\nexplicitly in -- in the portion of the\n\nmemorandum that you referenced.\n\nAnd, in addition, what I\u0027d point out\n\nis that at the very beginning of her memorandum,\n\npage 2, she specifically says that one of the\n\nthings that she considered were the judicial\n\nopinions reviewing the Duke Memorandum, all of\n\nthe district court decisions.\n\nAnd so then, when she gets to the\n\nspecific discussion of reliance interests, she\n\nsays that she is keenly aware that people have\n\nordered their lives in light of the DACA\n\ndecision.
