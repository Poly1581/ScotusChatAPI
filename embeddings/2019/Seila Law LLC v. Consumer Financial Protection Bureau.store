It -- it stops the\n\nPresident from at whim removing someone,\n\nreplacing someone with someone who is loyal to\n\nthe President rather than to the consumers that\n\nthe Bureau is set up to serve.\n\nYou talked about liberty.  Now whose\n\nliberty are we speaking of?  What about the\n\nconsumers?  I mean, Congress passed this law so\n\nthat the consumers would be better protected\n\nagainst financial fraud.

SHANMUGAM:  So two points in\n\nresponse to that, Justice Ginsburg.  The first\n\nis that the for-cause removal restriction here,\n\nthe inefficiency, neglect of duty, and\n\nmalfeasance standard, has never been understood\n\nto be a modest standard and certainly cannot be\n\nread to permit what we think the Constitution\n\nrequires; namely, that the President be able to\n\nremove a subordinate not just because of policy\n\ndisagreements but because the President has lost\n\nfaith in the official\u0027s judgment or because the\n\nPresident wants someone of his or her own\n\nchoosing.\n\nBut I think, second, to the extent\n\nthat we\u0027re talking about Congress\u0027s goal here,\n\nthere is abundant evidence that what Congress\n\nwas trying to do was to create an agency that\n\nprecisely, because of its desire to protect\n\nconsumers, was insulated from political control\n\nto the fullest extent possible.\n\nAs Elizabeth Warren, who was really\n\nthe progenitor of the CFPB, said at the time, if\n\nCongress did not create an agency with\n\nfunctional independence, \"my second choice is no\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nagency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left\n\non the floor.\"\n\nAnd so, if this Court is considering","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"10","file_name":"Seila Law LLC v.

The only difference between\n\nthe FTC and most cabinet agencies is the\n\nmulti-member structure. If that\u0027s irrelevant,\n\nthen Congress could presumably impose for-cause\n\nremoval restrictions on almost the entire\n\ncabinet, from Treasury to the EPA.\n\nSecond, that, in turn, would sever\n\nexecutive power from political accountability.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"17","file_name":"Seila Law LLC v.

Yet, he insists that this Court\n\nshould decide the constitutional question\n\nbecause the parties somehow agreed at the cert\n\nstage that ratification would be saved for the\n\nNinth Circuit.\n\nThus, this is a case, unlike Windsor,\n\nfor example, where the lack of adverseness\n\nbetween the parties is fundamentally distorting\n\nthis Court\u0027s ability to do its job and its\n\ngeneral preference to decide cases on\n\nnon-constitutional grounds rather -- rather than\n\nwading into difficult constitutional questions.\n\nThere is a phrase that aptly describes\n\nwhat the Solicitor General wants from this\n\nCourt, and it\u0027s an advisory opinion.  And this\n\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to issue it.\n\nBut, if this Court were to reach the\n\nmerits, it should affirm the decision below and\n\nthe constitutionality of a removal provision\n\nthat uses the same familiar phrase that this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"37","file_name":"Seila Law LLC v.

And they\n\nmay not even be able to make an appointment to\n\nthe Fed for a couple of years.  And so I think,\n\nas Justice Kagan alluded to, there is a number\n\nof different forms of multi-member agency.\n\nBut, second, I think that gets to the\n\nquestion that the Chief Justice asked earlier in\n\nthe argument, which is it depends a little bit\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"47","file_name":"Seila Law LLC v.
