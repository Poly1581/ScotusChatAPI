Under Section 158,\n\nsuch an order is not a final order entered in a\n\ncase or proceeding.\n\nAs this Court determined just four\n\nterms ago in Bullard versus Blue Hills Bank, the\n\nfact that an order disposes of a proceeding is\n\nnot, despite what -- despite what Respondent and\n\nthe government contends, the test for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ndetermining finality. That, in the words of the\n\nCourt, slices the case too thin.\n\nRather, an immediately appealable\n\norder is determined by considering the larger\n\nprocess at issue and whether the order is final\n\nby examining whether it alters the status quo\n\nand fixes the rights and obligations of the\n\nparties.\n\nIn Bullard, the relevant process was","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Ritzen Group, Inc. v.

So now that\n\nJackson Masonry has obtained that plan\n\nconfirmation that has resulted in a discharge,\n\nrevesting of the property, and a plan\n\ninjunction, it is effectively moot because there\n\nis no automatic stay that exists.\n\nIf there\u0027s no automatic stay that\n\nexists, how can Ritzen get relief from the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n43\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nautomatic stay in connection with a future\n\nappellate proceeding? That\u0027s the first part.\n\nThe second part is that nothing\n\nrequired Ritzen to consent to the jurisdiction\n\nof the bankruptcy court, but it filed an\n\nadversary proceeding and without reservation and\n\nallowed the bankruptcy court to determine the\n\ncase to finality.\n\nThis Court in Caterpillar versus Lewis\n\nhad a similar type of situation where the Court\n\nultimately concluded that a -- that a procedural\n\ndefect is not fatal if a federal adjudication\n\nexists and there was jurisdiction at the time of\n\nentry of the judgment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"38","file_name":"Ritzen Group, Inc. v.
