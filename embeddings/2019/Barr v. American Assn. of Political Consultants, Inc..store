it is characteristic in the legal\n\nculture that Congress would enact statutes that\n\nregulate communications made in particular\n\nfields of economic activity.\n\nAnd so you have\n\nlaws that

STEWART: Well, a couple of\n\nresponses to that.  The first is, as -- as I was\n\nindicating earlier, that the plaintiffs here did\n\nargue and they were entitled to argue that the\n\nappropriate remedy, if there was a\n\nconstitutional violation, was to strike down the\n\nwhole restriction.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"11","file_name":"Barr v.

problem, they don\u0027t have to do\n\neverything at once.\n\nYou object to the fact that some\n\nspeech is allowed, but the -- the allowance\n\ndoesn\u0027t reach more broadly.  And what we said in\n\nWilliams-Yulee, again, is so long as Congress is\n\nmoving in -- in what the Court regarded as the\n\nright direction, they don\u0027t have to do\n\neverything at the same time.\n\nSo the fact that you say we should\n\nallow more speech here, here, and here, again,\n\nit doesn\u0027t mean that it has to be done at the\n\nsame time as the first step was taken as it was\n\nhere.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nMR.
