SEE: I think there\u0027s two reasons\n\nwhy that\u0027s not a problem for federalism and\n\nstate flexibility.\n\nThe first is that states always retain\n\ninherent discretion to impose more stringent\n\nplans. So, if a state or a group of states\n\nwants to have a trading program, they can do\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\nthat. Section 7416 expressly preserves that\n\nright for the states.\n\nBut I think the second reason is it\u0027s\n\na false argument to say that more options for\n\nEPA leads to more options for the state. And\n\nthe Clean Power Plan shows how that\u0027s true.

in trading and cap-and-trade language.\n\nThat\u0027s in the implementation standards for NAAQS\n\nstandards. It\u0027s in the stratospheric ozone\n\nportion of the statute and also acid rain.\n\nSo we know Congress was thinking about\n\nthese nationwide cap-and-trade measures at the\n\nexact same time it made changes to 111 and it\n\ndidn\u0027t put those words in there.\n\nAnd I think going to the second\n\nquestion of assuming Congress did, assuming we\n\nhad something that specific, I think then we\n\nwould have to look at the non-delegation\n\nquestions, and I think the way that the Court\n\nhas looked at it through the intelligible\n\nprinciple, that\u0027s how we\u0027re arguing it here\n\nunder constitutional avoidance.  We think that\n\nthe limits that Congress put in the statute make\n\nsense if the agency is limited to things a\n\nparticular building can do.\n\nBut those limits have no meaning to\n\nthem if EPA is able to regulate at any level it\n\nwants to.

JACOB M. ROTH\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. ROTH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nOn our reading of Section 111(d), the\n\nEPA\u0027s power is a bounded one. It takes an\n\nexisting pollution source as a given and asks\n\nwhat emissions rate is achievable for that\n\nsource.\n\nRespondents, however, want to divorce\n\nthe EPA\u0027s best system of emission reduction from\n\nthe particular source that\u0027s being regulated.\n\nThat would allow the agency to effectively\n\ndictate not only the technical details of how a\n\ncoal plant operates but also the big-picture\n\npolicy of how the nation generates its\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\nelectricity.\n\nWhat is the right mix of energy\n\nsources for the nation and, for that matter\n\nalso, how the nation uses its electricity?

What? The FDA can regulate tobacco.\n\nOr, if you think about the eviction\n\nmoratorium case from earlier this term, you\n\nknow, it was, what?  The CDC can regulate the\n\nlandlord/tenant relationship.\n\nHere, if we\u0027re thinking about EPA\n\nregulating greenhouse gases, well, there\u0027s a\n\nmatch between the regulation and the agency\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\nwheelhouse, right?\n\nSo you\u0027re describing something a\n\nlittle bit different than Justice Kagan was\n\nasking you.

ALITO: Well, on to the merits\n\npart of what you said just before I asked my\n\nquestion, Mr. Roth made the argument that the\n\napplication of the major questions doctrine here\n\nwould be very

are\n\nincommensurable.  You know, how do you balance\n\nor take into account, what weight do you assign\n\nto, the effects on climate change, which some\n\npeople believe is a matter of civilizational\n\nsurvival, and the costs and the effect on jobs?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think it\u0027s\n\nimportant to distinguish between that type of\n\ncost/benefit analysis, which EPA would conduct\n\nin a regulatory impact analysis under an\n\nexecutive order, and the separate statutory\n\nconstraints in Section 7411, which we think\n\nwouldn\u0027t require that kind of balancing and very\n\nmuch constrain EPA.\n\nFirst, EPA has to determine that the\n\nstandard is adequately demonstrated or the\n\nsystem is adequately demonstrated.

why EPA can\u0027t go even a lot further than it\n\ndid in the CPP.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Because the D.C.\n\nCircuit, which has principally been responsible\n\nfor looking at these types of actions,

And I would\n\nalso point, Your Honor, not just to the actual\n\n1174(d) mercury rule but also the acid rain rule\n\nand the Good Neighbor rule under 7410.\n\nThose were all instances where\n\nCongress said that they had to use emissions\n\ntrading, for example, but they did not require\n\nit in 1174(a), but there\u0027s no indication that it\n\nexcluded it.\n\nAnd if I could, I think that the\n\nstatute really answers this question.
