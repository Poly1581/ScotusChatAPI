What test would --\n\nshould we use to review that exercise of\n\nauthority or to limit that authority?\n\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, I think there are\n\ntwo separate questions there, Justice Thomas,\n\nthat the Court would need to consider, and\n\ndeciding either one of them in our favor or\n\ndeciding that the application of the rule was\n\nharmless error would result in a judgment in the\n\ngovernment\u0027s favor here.\n\nBut the first question, reviewing the\n\nsupervisory rule, is whether the court of\n\nappeals had the power to enact the rule at all,\n\nand the second is whether this Court, exercising\n\nits own supervisory power, would find that rule\n\nreasonable.\n\nAs to the first question, I think the\n\nfundamental problem with this rule is that it\n\ndivests district courts of discretion that this\n\nCourt has repeatedly insisted that they have\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n6\n\nOfficial\n\nover jury selection.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"3","file_name":"United States v.

you look at, for example, page 424\n\nof the Court\u0027s decision in Mu\u0027Min against\n\nVirginia, the Court emphasizes that not only in\n\nconstitutional review but also in exercising\n\nsupervisory power over the federal courts, it\n\nhas given district courts wide discretion over\n\njury selection because they\u0027re there and they\n\ncan see the jurors as they\u0027re individually\n\nquestioned and are familiar -- also familiar\n\nwith local conditions.\n\nAs to the -- the second inquiry, I\n\nthink the main point here would be that although\n\nsuch questions can be helpful in some cases,\n\nthey\u0027re not invariably helpful, and the district\n\ncourt had sound reasons for thinking that they\n\nwould be unhelpful here.\n\nI\u0027d also note that on the third point\n\nI made, Justice Thomas, that the court of\n\nappeals, in devising this rule, clearly has a\n\nprejudice inquiry built into it.

I think everyone was\n\nactually taken by surprise that there even was\n\nsuch a thing as the Patriarca rule given that no\n\none had cited it in the district court,\n\nincluding the court of appeals itself.

That\u0027s quite clear from -- from,\n\nfor example, Mu\u0027Min.\n\nAnd if one accepts that courts of\n\nappeals can impose their own supervisory rules\n\nin this context, I think what they\u0027re labeling a\n\nsupervisory rule is just -- as I was telling the\n\nChief Justice, just an advisement to district\n\ncourts that this is how you should do it.\n\nBut I think it definitely exceeds his\n\n-- a court of appeals\u0027 authority to impose such\n\na rule that contradicts the way that this Court\n\nhas handled similar situations.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feigin, can I turn\n\nto the evidentiary question in this case?  I\u0027ve\n\nbeen having a little bit of a difficult time\n\nteasing apart your various arguments about why\n\nit is that the district court acted within its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to admit the evidence\n\nabout Tamerlan\u0027s participation in the Waltham\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\nmurders.\n\nSo I just thought I\u0027d give you a\n\nlittle bit of a hypothetical -- or maybe it\u0027s\n\nnot a hypothetical, maybe it\u0027s just asking you\n\nto assume something that you contest -- which is\n\nassume for me that the evidence was very strong\n\nthat Tamerlan participated in and indeed had a\n\nleading role in the Waltham murders, all right?\n\nSo assume that the evidence is strong with\n\nrespect to that.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"18","file_name":"United States v.

general Rules of\n\nEvidence?\n\nMR. FEIGIN: If I -- if I could, two\n\n-- two points in response to that, Your Honor.\n\nFirst, I actually think it does make a\n\ndifference because Rule 403, which has the word\n\n\"substantially\" in it, exists as a backstop to\n\nbolster other Rules of Evidence that already\n\nensure reliability, like the hearsay rule and\n\nthe best evidence rule, whereas Section 3593(c)\n\nsubstantially lowers the bar for the admission\n\nof evidence in the penalty phase of a capital\n\ntrial but nevertheless leaves the district court\n\nwith some tools to ensure fundamental\n\nreliability and ensuring that the -- the\n\nevidence is going to be appropriate for the\n\ncase.\n\nAnd the second point I would -- I\n\nwould make is just what negative effect, I\n\nthink, introducing the evidence here would have\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"27","file_name":"United States v.

I -- I think one way to\n\nlook at this is, if you look at, for example,\n\nthe Court\u0027s decision in Green against Georgia,\n\nthat -- Georgia there maintained its hearsay\n\nrules in the penalty phase of a capital trial.\n\nAnd it had imposed the hearsay rule, and this\n\nCourt found that it had violated the defendant\u0027s\n\nEighth Amendment right in doing so.  But, before\n\nit was -- before it was able to reach that\n\nconclusion, it assured itself that the evidence\n\nwas reliable.\n\nAnd I think that is a -- at least a\n\nminimum floor that even the Eighth Amendment\n\nwould require.

That\n\nbedrock principle was violated in two ways here.\n\nFirst, the district court violated the\n\nFirst Circuit\u0027s longstanding voir dire\n\nsupervisory rule by refusing to learn whether\n\njurors had been exposed to inadmissible and\n\ninflammatory publicity that could prejudice\n\ntheir consideration of the death penalty.\n\nSecond and more fundamentally, the\n\ndistrict court violated the Eighth Amendment by\n\ncategorically excluding evidence that Tamerlan\n\nrobbed and murdered three people as an act of\n\njihad. That evidence was central to the\n\nmitigation case.\n\nThe -- the defense\u0027s entire argument\n\nwas that Dzhokhar was less culpable because\n\nTamerlan indoctrinated him and then led the\n\nbombings.  Tamerlan\u0027s commission of the murders\n\nsupplied the key indoctrinating event by\n\ndemonstrating to Dzhokhar that Tamerlan had\n\nirrevocably committed himself to violent jihad.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"49","file_name":"United States v.

And just because something\n\nwould be admitted under the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence as a statement against interest or, I\n\nguess put differently, the hearsay rules\n\nwouldn\u0027t keep it out doesn\u0027t mean that the\n\ndistrict court wouldn\u0027t have discretion under\n\n403, under a very similar standard as this, to\n\nkeep it out.\n\nSo I think another way to think about\n\nJustice Alito\u0027s question is, is this part of the\n\nFederal Death Penalty Act inconsistent with the\n\nEighth Amendment, or do you think that that\n\nsentence in the Federal Death Penalty Act is a\n\nlegitimate ground for excluding evidence?\n\nMS. ANDERS: I don\u0027t think the two are\n\ninconsistent, and -- and I\u0027ll answer that\n\ndirectly, but, first, let me say that I think\n\nthe way to think about reliability here is that\n\nthe district court committed legal error by\n\nfinding that the corroborating evidence here\n\ndidn\u0027t rise to the level of the minimal indicia\n\nof reliability, the standard that applies.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"57","file_name":"United States v.
