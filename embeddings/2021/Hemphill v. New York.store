my first answer is that\u0027s not in\n\nfront of you here today.\n\nBut going back to the New York court\n\nof appeals opinion in Reid, it cited the case --\n\nthis Court\u0027s decision in Harris, which involved\n\nthe Miranda rule and a forfeiture exception to\n\nthe Miranda rule.  And I want to draw out one\n\nimportant difference there.\n\nEven if you didn\u0027t want to get wrapped\n\nup in the testimonial versus non-testimonial\n\nline under Crawford, it\u0027s important to note that\n\nthis case is miles away even from Harris.\n\nFirst of all, Harris involves a\n\nprophylactic rule, and this involves a rule of\n\nexclusion in the Constitution itself.\n\nAnd the other thing in Harris is what\n\nthe Court said is the truth-seeking process of\n\nthe courts should not be perverted by allowing\n\nthe defendant to -- to manipulate evidence and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\nkeep out trustworthy evidence.\n\nWell, what you have here, even if you\n\nleave Crawford entirely aside, is the classic\n\nform of presumptively unreliable evidence the\n\nConfrontation Clause has always been concerned\n\nwith.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that\u0027s this\n\ncase.\n\nMR.

FISHER: So for two reasons.  One\n\nis the New York Guide to Evidence itself calls\n\nthe rule of completeness and the more broader\n\n\"opening the door\" theory rules of evidence, so\n\njust as a matter of nomenclature and\n\ncharacterization under New York law, the state\n\nis wrong.\n\nBut just leaving labels aside, the\n\nreason why the state is wrong is because the\n\nadmissibility of a statement under the \"opening\n\nthe door\" theory turns on the contents of the\n\nstatement.  And that\u0027s to be -- that\u0027s to be\n\ncontrasted with situations like notice and\n\ndemand under Melendez-Diaz or Illinois versus\n\nAllen or things that depend on things having to\n\ndo not with the content of the defendant\u0027s case\n\nbut, rather, about his timeliness of an\n\nobjection or his other -- you know, other\n\nprocedural actions he might take.\n\nSo we distinguish substance of the\n\nstatement rules, which are evidence rules and\n\nwhich run into the Confrontation Clause, from\n\njust procedural devices to manage the trial with\n\ndefendants have to meet under the Confrontation\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"34","file_name":"Hemphill v.

So I -- I suppose the state may try and\n\ncome back and suggest that its rule is actually\n\npretty close to and not much of an outgrowth of\n\nthe rule of completeness.\n\nWhat -- what are the distinguishing\n\nfeatures in your mind that make this radically\n\ndifferent?\n\nMR. FISHER: The core distinguishing\n\nfeature is that in a rule-of-completeness\n\nsituation, the defendant has put in part of the\n\nabsent witness\u0027s statement into play, whereas,\n\nhere, Mr. Hemphill did not put Mr. Morris\u0027s\n\ntestimony or anything else he said into play.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why not?  With the\n\nstatement about the 9-millimeter casing found,\n\nwhere else would it have come from?\n\nMR. FISHER: Well, that\u0027s just a true\n\nfact about evidence found in Mr. Morris\u0027s\n\napartment.  And that\u0027s far different than what\n\nhe said.

You could delay the\n\nproceedings.  Courts have alternatives, but it\u0027s\n\nreally got to be up to the judge to weigh and\n\nbalance those alternatives to come up with the\n\nthing that makes -- is the best fitting.\n\nAnd what he did here, as I said, was\n\nhe not -- admitted not only the couple of lines\n\nfrom Morris about what he did, but he -- the\n\njudge also allowed the jurors to hear the\n\nreasons that Morris took that plea.
