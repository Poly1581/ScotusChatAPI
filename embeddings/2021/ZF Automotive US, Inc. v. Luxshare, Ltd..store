ROMAN MARTINEZ\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN 21-401\n\nMR. MARTINEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSection 1782\u0027s text, structure, and\n\nhistory make clear that district courts are not\n\nauthorized to grant discovery for use in purely\n\nprivate foreign arbitrations.  The key statutory\n\nlanguage is the complete phrase \"foreign\n\ntribunal.\"  That phrase most naturally refers to\n\ngovernment tribunals, just like the phrase\n\n\"foreign leader\" most naturally refers to\n\ngovernment leaders.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nOrdinary and legal usage confirm that\n\ninterpretation.  So do nearby provisions using\n\nthe same phrase, as well as this Court\u0027s\n\ndecision in Intel.\n\nThe history supports us too. The\n\nrules commission drafted this statute under a\n\ndirect command from Congress in the 1958 Act to\n\npromote interstate comity and assist the\n\njudicial and quasi-judicial arms of foreign\n\ngovernments.  The commission, Senate, and House\n\nreports all show that the drafters chose the\n\nwords \"foreign tribunal\" to achieve these\n\ngovernment-focused objectives.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"3","file_name":"ZF Automotive US, Inc. v.

I think courts enforce private contracts\n\nall the time, and we all recognize that the\n\ncontracts themselves remain private.  So the\n\nfact that there\u0027s, like, judicial involvement\n\ndoesn\u0027t kind of, you know, make it a -- a public\n\ncontract in any sort of meaningful way.\n\nI think, secondly on that, U.S. courts\n\nacross the country have had to wrestle with the\n\nidea of whether arbitrators are state actors for\n\nconstitutional purposes.  Courts have uniformly\n\nrejected that idea.  I think there are five\n\ncircuits out there have said arbitrators are not\n\nstate actors, I think recognizing that\n\narbitration really is something that\u0027s private.\n\nAnd then -- and then, finally, I do\n\nthink that having a judicial role is not enough\n\nto make an arbitration governmental because the\n\njudicial role is so limited.  Whether it\u0027s under\n\nthe FAA or under Section 1059 of the German\n\nCivil Procedure Code, review of arbitrations,\n\nwhen you\u0027re being asked to enforce an\n\narbitration -- enforce an arbitral judgment or\n\naward, is extremely limited, and if -- if a\n\ncourt comes in and sees a -- an error of law, it\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"23","file_name":"ZF Automotive US, Inc. v.

DAVIES\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN 21-401\n\nMR. DAVIES: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nCongress has authorized assistance to\n\nforeign tribunals.  The best, most natural\n\ninterpretation of that broad phrase includes a\n\nforeign-seated commercial arbitral tribunal.\n\nA commercial arbitral tribunal is a\n\ntribunal because it\u0027s authorized to render an\n\nadjudication of the parties\u0027 legal rights that\n\nis final, unless it\u0027s set aside by a reviewing\n\ncourt. That\u0027s consistent with this Court\u0027s\n\ninterpretation of \"tribunal\" in Intel and with\n\ncontemporaneous usage of \"tribunal\" to mean\n\ncommercial arbitral tribunals.\n\nAnd a foreign-seated commercial\n\narbitral tribunal is foreign because its legal\n\ndomicile or its juridical home is in another\n\njurisdiction.  There is no basis to draw an\n\narbitrary line at the tribunals of foreign\n\ncountries.  That limitation is not supported by\n\nthe statutory language or context or by Intel.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"70","file_name":"ZF Automotive US, Inc. v.

YANOS: Absolutely.  I -- that\u0027s\n\nactually exactly where I was going to go.\n\nThe first thing I would mention is\n\nthat a number of sovereigns have invoked\n\nSection 1782 in connection with Bilateral\n\nInvestment Treaty disputes:  Turkey, Equador.\n\nThat\u0027s -- that\u0027s in -- in our brief in one of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n97\n\nOfficial\n\nthe footnotes.\n\nSo it\u0027s not only investors who have\n\ninvoked Section 1782 to obtain third-party\n\ndiscovery.  So, you know, comity should --\n\nshould take that into account as well.\n\nAnd the other is that, obviously, the\n\nMixed Claims Commission had no ability to\n\nreciprocate to the United States when it was\n\ncoming to discovery. So comity is not purely a\n\nbilateral question.  It\u0027s a question of\n\nrespecting international tribunals created by\n\nsovereigns or imbued with authority by\n\nsovereigns and giving those tribunals respect\n\nand promote -- you know, assisting them.\n\nAnd I should mention that Mixed Claims\n\nCommissions existed well beyond the\n\nGerman-American Mixed Claims Commission.  There\n\nwere a number formed involving foreign\n\nsovereigns like Mexico and France, and, of\n\ncourse, the U.S. was an innovator in this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"87","file_name":"ZF Automotive US, Inc. v.

turns on the\n\ntext and history of the key phrase and in\n\nparticular the -- the meaning of the entire\n\nphrase \"foreign tribunal\" or \"foreign\n\ninternational tribunal.\"\n\nLuxshare has conceded what I think was\n\napparent from their briefs, which is that they\n\ndon\u0027t have any evidence, any example, of the\n\nphrase \"foreign tribunal,\" the one that\u0027s used\n\nin this statute, ever being used to cover\n\nprivate arbitrations.  They don\u0027t give us a\n\ndictionary example.  They don\u0027t give us a\n\nstatute.  They don\u0027t give us a court decision, a\n\nnewspaper, nothing.\n\nAnd so, instead, what they do is they\n\ncriticize our use of -- our statutory arguments.\n\nThey say we don\u0027t have an example either.  But\n\nthat\u0027s not right.  We have the Corpus\n\nLinguistics study, which, if you want to look at\n\nit or not, we think you should look at it.\n\nMy friend criticized the study in\n\nvarious ways.  We think you can judge for\n\nyourself.  There\u0027s a 283-page appendix that\u0027s\n\nappended to the study that lets you kind of\n\ncheck their work.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"99","file_name":"ZF Automotive US, Inc. v.

importantly, though, it\u0027s just\n\nnot true, as my friend said, that we have not\n\ncited a single example of anyone using the\n\nphrase \"foreign tribunal\" to go beyond courts to\n\ncover other types of quasi -- of governmental\n\nentities. The very best example of that is this\n\nexact statute, this exact statute.\n\nThe rules commission itself said we\u0027re\n\nusing the word \"foreign tribunal\" because we\n\nwant to pick up quasi-judicial agencies, foreign\n\nadministrative tribunals, and investigating\n\nmagistrates.  So this example, I think, refutes\n\ntheir case.  And in the absence of any example\n\non their side, I think we win sort of the plain\n\ntext argument.  And I think that\u0027s true in both\n\ncases. If you look at the text, the surrounding\n\ncontext, and the history, I think we have the\n\nbetter reading.\n\nSecond, I just want to touch on the\n\npossible workaround Justice Breyer suggested,\n\nwhich is essentially allowing this kind of\n\ndiscovery only when the arbitrator says it\u0027s\n\nokay.  We don\u0027t think that\u0027s work -- a workable\n\nsolution for a couple reasons.\n\nFirst of all, Intel forecloses it\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n112\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"100","file_name":"ZF Automotive US, Inc. v.
