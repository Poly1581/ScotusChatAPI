that there are two\n\ngoals to the convention, not one.

That\u0027s its\n\nnumber one priority.\n\nIts second priority is to protect the\n\nchild if there\u0027s grave danger.  But, if the\n\nconvention insisted that a child shouldn\u0027t be\n\nreturned, it would have said don\u0027t return the\n\nchild if it\u0027s a grave danger.  But, instead, it\n\ngives a district court discretion.\n\nSo, to me, that means that you have to\n\nkeep the first goal in mind as well.

A lot has happened in\n\nthe last two years since the -- the last return\n\norder.\n\nAnd that process alone, in the same\n\nway that we object to the -- the categorical\n\nsort of Second Circuit mandatory rule in the\n\nfirst place, that process alone is damaging to\n\nthe child and inconsistent with the convention.\n\nIt\u0027s certainly a possible outcome\n\nhere, a possible remedy, but we think, on\n\nbalance, there is a safe and swift remedy\n\navailable to this Court and for this child, and\n\nit would serve the child\u0027s interests and be\n\nconsistent with the convention to take that\n\nremedy now and end this, rather than send it\n\nback for a third bite at the apple.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  You\u0027re -- you\u0027re\n\nthinking -- maybe I will ask a question I -- I\n\nthink might be a problem.  Judges in different\n\ncountries, there\u0027s a child in front of them.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"20","file_name":"Golan v.

This is the fifth Hague case that\n\nthis Court has heard in 12 years, and in each of\n\nits prior opinions, it identified the grave risk\n\nexception as an example of where return is not\n\nrequired because it is the plain reading of the\n\nconvention.  There is no obligation to return,\n\nno heavy thumb on the scale towards return, once\n\ngrave risk is proven.\n\nAnd the exception exists for a reason.\n\nAnd this is the first case where a mother has\n\nproven the grave risk exception by the\n\nexceedingly high evidentiary standard in this\n\ncountry, by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nAnd so, if we go back the three years","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"71","file_name":"Golan v.
