We think there\n\nis what functions as a definition both of who is\n\nentitled and what that entitlement means.\n\nNow those provisions are at 426(a) and\n\n(b), which answers the question who is entitled.\n\nIt says every individual in these categories\n\nshall be entitled.

described, and I\u0027d like to walk\n\nthrough it in a bit of detail, but I think the\n\nthrough line is that the agency is not flouting\n\nCongress but responding in good faith under the\n\ncircumstances to actions by Congress and\n\njudicial decisions.\n\nI think that the relevant history\n\nstarts in 1983 in the statute that created the\n\nprospective payment program.  In that statute,\n\nCongress did tell HHS to adopt adjustments,\n\nincluding for low-income patients, but what it\n\nsaid was as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n\nAnd the agency determined after\n\nlooking at the data that it didn\u0027t think an\n\nadjustment was appropriate.  That\u0027s reflected in\n\na series of Federal Register rulemakings that\n\nare cited collectively at JA 39 to 40. So the\n\nagency made that initial determination.\n\nNow, at that point, you\u0027re right,\n\nCongress disagreed and said, no, you really must\n\nadopt a definition, and it gave the agency a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n12\n\nOfficial\n\nvery short deadline that the agency didn\u0027t meet.\n\nBut, when a court ordered the agency to meet\n\nanother deadline, the agency complied.  All of\n\nthat was overtaken by the 1986 definition that\n\nCongress adopted.\n\nNow the agency did interpret that for\n\nthe first decade or so not to include patient\n\ndays that were not paid for, i.e., covered by\n\nthe Medicaid or Medicare programs, and Congress","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"9","file_name":"Becerra v.

But four courts of appeals\n\nrejected that.  So the agency is responding as\n\nthose events unfold.\n\nBut I think, at a broader level, the\n\n-- the answer to the question which\n\ninterpretation is best can\u0027t be answered by\n\nbroad-brush statements of congressional purpose\n\nto increase payments, especially given the\n\nhighly reticulated calculation set forth at 18a\n\nto 25 of our appendix, where Congress laid out\n\nall these detailed things.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"28","file_name":"Becerra v.

has repeatedly violated those\n\nclear instructions and has done so again here.\n\nIn this case, HHS has concluded that\n\ninpatients are entitled to benefits under Part A\n\nfor days on which they\u0027re entitled to no Part A\n\nbenefits, no inpatient benefits because those\n\nbenefits have been exhausted, and no other\n\nbenefits because all other Part A benefits are\n\nincompatible with being a hospital inpatient who\n\nrequires discharge.\n\nThat interpretation is impermissible.\n\nFirst, the agency\u0027s position violates the plain\n\nmeaning of the statute.  As Justice Kavanaugh\n\npointed out, the agency reads the statutory\n\nterms \"entitled\" and \"eligible\" to mean the same\n\nthing. That is both inconsistent with the\n\nordinary meaning of \"entitled\" and contrary to\n\nhow the agency interprets \"entitled\" in the same\n\nsentence of the statute.\n\nThe agency claims that the ordinary\n\nmeaning of \"entitled\" doesn\u0027t matter because\n\n426, according to the agency, controls and --\n\nand explains what Congress mean -- means by\n\n\"entitled to benefits under Part A.\"  But that\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\nwrong. 426 is not a definitional provision,\n\nand, in any event, it addresses a different\n\nissue.\n\nSecond, the agency\u0027s interpretation is\n\nunreasonable.  HHS\u0027s rule provided almost no\n\njustification for its repudiation of an\n\ninterpretation that it held for over two\n\ndecades.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"31","file_name":"Becerra v.
