intelligence\n\npartnerships depend on our partners\u0027 trust that\n\nwe will keep those relationships confidential.\n\nRespondents seek discovery that would\n\ncompel a breach of that trust by confirming or\n\ndenying the existence of an alleged CIA facility\n\nin Poland, and Respondents seek that discovery\n\nnot to vindicate any rights under U.S. law but,\n\ninstead, in a discretionary Section 1782\n\napplication aimed at sending evidence abroad to\n\na foreign investigation whose very purpose is to\n\nreveal and prosecute the alleged involvement of\n\nPolish officials in covert CIA

why that\n\ncompelled disclosure would seriously harm the\n\nnational security.  The Ninth Circuit should\n\nhave afforded deference to that expert judgment,\n\nand it failed to do so because it made two\n\nfundamental legal errors.\n\nFirst, the Ninth Circuit undertook its\n\nown inquiry into whether the existence of the\n\nalleged facility was a secret given public\n\nspeculation on that subject.  But, under this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Reynolds, the question is\n\nnot whether a court thinks that the information\n\nsought is secret in some abstract sense; it is\n\nwhether compelled disclosure will harm the\n\nnational security.\n\nThat is a question that squarely\n\nimplicates the CIA director\u0027s special knowledge","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"United States v.

In the prior contexts\n\nwhere they\u0027ve testified, in the Salim litigation\n\nand in the military commissions at Guantanamo,\n\ntheir testimony has focused on the nature of the\n\ntreatment of detainees, on the what was done.\n\nThat is information that the executive branch,\n\nafter extensive consultation internally and with\n\nCongress, decided to declassify in 2014 to\n\nfacilitate public scrutiny of the United States\u0027\n\nactions.  So that information is no longer\n\nclassified.\n\nBut part and parcel of that\n\ndeclassification decision was a decision to keep\n\nsecret, to keep the trust with our foreign\n\npartners.  And because this proceeding is all\n\nabout revealing the involvement of foreign\n\npartners, it\u0027s fundamentally different from the\n\ntestimony that has been given in the past.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  You say -- you offer\n\nthe utmost deference standard.

FLETCHER:  I\u0027m not aware of\n\nauthority that speaks to that one way or the\n\nother. The way I -- I could imagine it being\n\nrelevant is potentially in the necessity\n\ninquiry, but I think the way that that would be\n\nrelevant is not just about the seriousness of\n\nthe conduct at issue but what is the need that\n\nthe party seeking the information has for it.\n\nAnd so, if you had a party that was\n\nasserting rights in U.S. court, substantive\n\nlegal rights in U.S. court, the gravity of those\n\nrights might weigh into the necessity inquiry.\n\nHere, though, I understand, you know, the\n\nseriousness of the allegations about treatment,\n\nbut I think the necessity inquiry and the\n\nnecessity analysis looks very different because\n\nit\u0027s ultimately evidence for a foreign\n\nproceeding, not rights under U.S. law.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Anything\n\nfurther, Justice Kavanaugh?\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No further\n\nquestions.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n41\n\nOfficial\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBarrett?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"34","file_name":"United States v.
