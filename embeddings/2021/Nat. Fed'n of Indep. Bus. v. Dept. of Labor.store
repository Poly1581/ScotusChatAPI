more\n\nexpansive than that as certainly modified by\n\n\"proper\" or in the context of \"proper.\"  So it\n\njust suggests that \"necessary\" can be really\n\nnecessary or not necessarily really

over the American people.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, OSHA has a lot\n\nof expertise about workforces and about the\n\ndangers that workforces can confront individual\n\nemployees with.  And I\u0027m sure OSHA also talked\n\nto other agencies within the federal government\n\nto consider public health issues and brought\n\nthat knowledge to bear as well with its\n\nknowledge of -- of how workplaces function and\n\n-- and, again, came out with a -- a\n\nwell-supported policy that has political\n\nleadership behind it and all the political\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n33\n\nOfficial\n\naccountability that one could wish for.\n\nAnd why is it that courts would\n\ndisplace that judgment and say it is up to us\n\nto decide about vaccination policy in the\n\nemployment settings of this country?\n\nMR.

I mean, the line it drew, for\n\ninstance, with the hundred-or-more employee\n\nlines, they said they were doing that because\n\nthey thought the larger companies were the ones\n\nthat had the administrative capacity to do it.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t because they were denser working\n\nenvironments.  You could have a company with a\n\nhundred employees and every single person is\n\nworking somewhere else.\n\nEven the narrow exception that they\n\nhave raised, even they say that 9 percent of\n\nlandscapers and 5 percent of highway workers","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"28","file_name":"Nat.

So the way I would\n\nanswer that is to say just about every\n\nworkplace has been affected, but that doesn\u0027t\n\nmean the work is arising from the workplace.\n\nTo take another example, if we look at\n\nterrorism, there\u0027s some risk of terrorism that\n\nwe face when we wake up in the morning.  We\n\nface it at home, in public, and at work. And\n\nwe adjusted to that after 9/11.  If you see\n\nsomething, say something.  Ideas like that.\n\nNow the fact that you face that work\n\n-- that risk when you go to work doesn\u0027t make\n\nit a workplace risk.

find it, you know, unbelievable that it\n\ncould be in the public interest to suddenly\n\nstop these vaccinations.  And the only answer\n\nthat was given was a lot of people will quit.\n\nWell, OSHA considered that.  My\n\nwonderful law clerk has 61475, 63422, 61466, 61\n\n474 and 475, those are pages.  I don\u0027t think\n\nyou should read all 61,000, but, nonetheless,\n\nthere are at least five or 10 pages where they\n\nwent into this, and they said, in our view,\n\nhmm, yeah, that\u0027s right, some people may quit,\n\nmaybe 3 percent.

the -- the purpose --\n\nif this is to be sustained, it has to be on the\n\nground that it presents a grave danger to\n\nunvaccinated workers who have chosen to be\n\nunvaccinated.\n\nThat\u0027s my understanding of the issue,\n\nbut maybe I haven\u0027t understood it correctly.\n\nIs that your understanding?

So the broad societal effects\n\nare not -- are not at issue.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  And protection of\n\nvaccinated employees, who may face some danger\n\nof contracting the virus, was not the basis for\n\nthis rule, is that correct?\n\nMR. FLOWERS: Correct.  And I would go\n\nfurther and say they cannot rely at all on the\n\nrisk to vaccinated workers because they\n\nconclude -- this is 61419 of the Federal\n\nRegister -- that no one who\u0027s vaccinated is --\n\nis in grave danger.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nSotomayor.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"55","file_name":"Nat.

ELIZABETH B.

It studied the science\n\nof how this virus is transmitted and found that\n\nworkers are exposed to danger when they\u0027re\n\ninside together for as little as 15 minutes,\n\nand OSHA considered the extensive evidence that\n\nunvaccinated employees are at heightened risk\n\nof contracting the virus, of transmitting it to\n\nothers and infecting their coworkers, and of\n\nsuffering the gravest consequences,\n\nhospitalization and even death.\n\nTo protect against that grave danger,\n\nthe standard requires employers to adopt a\n\npolicy that unvaccinated employees either get\n\nvaccinated or mask and test.  Those are\n\ncommonplace and highly effective measures that\n\nOSHA determined were essential to stopping the\n\nspread of this dangerous disease at work.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"64","file_name":"Nat.

JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  I just wanted to ask\n\nyou a question on this issue of a commencement\n\nof enforcement and the issuance of a stay.\n\nThis ETS was issued a couple

PRELOGAR:  Yes.\n\nOf course,\n\nJustice Sotomayor.\n\nTo be clear, we think that Congress\n\nhas already acted here in passing\n\nSection 655(c) to authorize OSHA to take this\n\nkind of swift action in response to an\n\nemergency situation.\n\nIf you look at the plain text of the\n\nstatute, we think that OSHA\u0027s standard clearly\n\nHeritage Reporting

And to the extent\n\nthat the Applicants are suggesting that there\u0027s\n\nsome kind of specific authorization requirement\n\nhere that Congress had to do more, I think that\n\ngets to the heart of your question, which is\n\nthat when this Court has interpreted statutes\n\nbefore, it hasn\u0027t departed from plain meaning\n\nand imposed that kind of burden on Congress to\n\nlegislate with that specificity and that\n\ngranularity, particularly in an emergency\n\nsituation like this one.\n\nAnd the Applicants have pointed to no\n\naspect of the statute that would warrant that\n\nkind of result here.  It\u0027s their interpretation\n\nthat runs counter to express statutory\n\nprovisions, Section 669(a)(5), that\n\nspecifically contemplates that immunization\n\nrequirements can be imposed, the American","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"86","file_name":"Nat.

-- don\u0027t complain that Congress hasn\u0027t\n\ndone anything and that -- you know, that was 50\n\nyears ago that you\u0027re saying Congress acted.

ALITO:  -- I mean, suppose --\n\nthis is a little science fiction, but maybe it\n\nwill illustrate a point.\n\nSuppose that this protection were\n\nprovided not by the administration of a

specifically authorize it; we\u0027re not going\n\nto give the statutory text its -- its ordinary\n\nmeaning.\n\nInstead, in the cases where the Court\n\nhas looked at those kinds of consequences, it\n\nhas always identified a conflict with other\n\nexpress statutory language, a conflict with\n\nother statutes that Congress has enacted that\n\ndirectly addressed the issue at question, or a\n\nconflict with the entire structure of the\n\nstatute such that it would be unrecognizable to\n\nthe Congress that enacted it.\n\nAnd it\u0027s only been in those situations\n\nwhere the Court has identified a textual and\n\nstructural problem with the agency\u0027s\n\ninterpretation in the beginning, using those\n\ntraditional tools of statutory construction,\n\nthat the Court has then gone on

And,\n\nhere, our choice on the one hand is a federal\n\nagency and on the other hand the Congress of\n\nthe United States and state governments.\n\nNow you argue we should not consider\n\nthe major questions doctrine unless and until\n\nwe find a statutory ambiguity.

PRELOGAR:  So accepting the\n\nassumption that there\u0027s an ambiguity, which, of\n\ncourse, we disagree with, as you know, I think\n\nthat many of the factors you identified are\n\njust simply inconsistent with the whole premise\n\nof the OSH Act.\n\nSo it\u0027s true that states have a police\n\npower over health and safety.  But, as this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n120\n\nOfficial\n\nCourt recognized in the Gade case, Congress in\n\nenacting the OSH Act specifically brought the\n\nfederal government into the role of protecting\n\nthe health and safety of America\u0027s workers and\n\ndisplacing and preempting state law in that\n\nfield.\n\nAnd so I think the idea that simply\n\nbecause states have that residual police power\n\nprovides a basis to assume that the OSH Act\n\ncan\u0027t have any application or that there has to\n\nbe a specific authorization here of each and\n\nevery type of mitigation measure is just\n\nfundamentally inconsistent with Congress\u0027s\n\npolicy as embodied in that Act.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: What do we make of\n\nthe fact that Congress -- that OSHA has not\n\ntraditionally mandated other vaccines for other\n\nhazards that could be -- pose a graze -- grave\n\nrisk, some might say? The flu kills people\n\nevery year.  Other grave diseases do too.  And\n\nthere are vaccines against many.

here, I think the critical\n\ndifference is that the Applicants haven\u0027t\n\npointed to anything in this statute that\n\napproximates the kind of textual or structural\n\nproblem that has prompted the Court to look at\n\nthose kinds of consequences before.\n\nAnd it would be their interpretation\n\nthat creates those problems.  They would render\n\nsuperfluous Section 669(a)(5)\u0027s specific\n\nrecognition that immunization requirements can\n\nbe imposed under the OSH Act itself. By saying\n\nthat OSHA can\u0027t regulate COVID-19 in the\n\nworkplace, they\u0027d give no effect to Congress\u0027s\n\nappropriation just last year directing OSHA to\n\ndo just that and to target that grave danger.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n127\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd so, in this case, we think that\n\nall of the textual clues line up on our side,\n\nin addition to the plain language of the\n\nstatute.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And one other\n\nquestion related to this -- sorry to prolong\n\nthis -- but Congress has specifically referred\n\nto vaccines in a variety of contexts.\n\nImmigration contexts, those statutes authorize\n\nspecifically via language vaccines.  Military\n\ncontexts, which you would expect, at least the\n\nAnthrax vaccine is referenced in the military\n\nstatutes.  The National Childhood Vaccine Act\n\npassed in \u002786 refers, and that\u0027s a different\n\ncontext, but dealing with vaccines.

So my first question has to do with\n\nthe question with which Justice Thomas opened,\n\nwhich is the meaning of \"necessary.\"  So, of\n\ncourse, when OSHA passes a rule through its\n\nregular regulatory process, it has to go\n\nthrough notice and comment, and that\u0027s a way of\n\nholding an agency accountable.  All affected\n\npeople have an opportunity to comment, and the\n\nagency develops a robust record.\n\nWith an ETS, of course, the agency can\n\ncircumvent that process so that it can act more\n\nquickly.  So, for an ETS, we would want that\n\npower to be the exception, not the rule.

explained why vaccination as the\n\nsingle most effective way to target all of the\n\nways that the virus threatens workers in the\n\nworkplace was a necessary measure here.\n\nAnd it further explained why masking\n\nand testing would be essential if workers\n\nremain unvaccinated, in order to ensure that,\n\ndespite their higher risk level of contracting\n\nthe virus, they couldn\u0027t carry it into the\n\nworkplace and spread it to their coworkers.\n\nSo I think the suggestion that this\n\nwasn\u0027t adequately explained is inconsistent\n\nwith the -- the arguments they\u0027re

They\u0027re saying\n\nthose things should have just been carved out\n\naltogether.\n\nBut that is inconsistent with the\n\nSecretary\u0027s judgment that all unvaccinated\n\nworkers face a grave danger and that the risk\n\nexists anywhere that employees are gathered\n\nindoors together.\n\nAnd, again, there might be\n\nsubcategories within those groups that are in\n\ngraver danger, but I don\u0027t think there is any\n\nbasis on this record to conclude that the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"116","file_name":"Nat.
