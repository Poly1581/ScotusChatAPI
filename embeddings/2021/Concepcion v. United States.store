one -- one\n\nlast thing.\n\nSo I come back to my original\n\nquestion.\n\nI think it was my first question.\n\nIf what Congress wanted to say was, in these\n\ncases covered by the First Step Act, you just\n\nresentence the defendant, why didn\u0027t they just\n\nsay that?  Why did they use this formulation?\n\nMR. McCLOUD: Justice Alito, I think\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n19\n\nOfficial\n\nit\u0027s because Congress did not want a plenary\n\nresentencing.  As I said before, we think that\n\nrules like waiver and forfeiture and law of the\n\ncase would still apply.\n\nSo Congress was not wiping the slate\n\nclean. It was giving district courts the\n\noption to make an exception to finality and to\n\ngive the defendant a new sentence that\u0027s lower\n\nrelative to their prior sentence.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mr. McCloud --\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  So here\u0027s the\n\nexample.  Look, 3553(a) applies to most\n\nsentencing because almost all sentencing\n\nstatutes don\u0027t list factors.

McCLOUD: So, Justice Kavanaugh,\n\nlet me start with the \"as if\" language, and\n\nthen I\u0027ll turn to the question about disparity.\n\nWe agree that the \"as if\" language\n\nplays an important role in the statute, but\n\nit\u0027s a very limited role.  The \"as if\" language\n\nis critical for getting around 1 -- U.S.C. 109,\n\nthe federal savings statute, and making\n\nSections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act\n\nretroactive.  And that\u0027s clear from the\n\nreference in the clause to the time of the\n\ncovered offense.  As this Court explained in\n\nDorsey, that is the point at which criminal\n\npenalties affix to a defendant.\n\nSo all Congress was trying to do in\n\nthe \"as if\" clause was to make clear that when\n\na court imposes a new sentence, it doesn\u0027t have\n\nto be bound by the statutory penalties that\n\nwere previously in effect for that defendant.\n\nSo it is not a limitation.\n\nThere are, in fact, limitations in the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"20","file_name":"Concepcion v.

principal argument, as\n\nyou\u0027ve heard this morning, in favor of such an\n\nentitlement rests on the term \"impose\" in\n\nSection 404, which Petitioner would read to\n\nincorporate a requirement to redo the\n\nSection 3553(a) analysis that a court does in\n\nimposing an initial sentence.\n\nThat argument is inconsistent with the\n\ntext of Section 404 as a whole, in particular,\n\nwith the text of Section 404(c), as well as\n\nwith the undisputedly limited scope and nature\n\nof sentence reduction proceedings.\n\nAs the statutory text reflects, the\n\nlodestar of any proceeding under Section 404 is\n\nthe defendant\u0027s existing lawful sentence.\n\nAt every single proceeding under\n\nSection 404, the district court has already\n\nfully considered the Section 3553(a) factors at\n\nthe original sentencing, and the only question\n\nbefore the court is whether to reduce that\n\ncurrent sentence.\n\nIn that context, we think that\n\nCongress chose to require district courts

So, if we limit this just to the\n\nmandatory minimums, what are we going to find?\n\nWe\u0027re going to find that where you\u0027re talking\n\nabout 4, 3, 2, and 1, for example, and where\n\nthe Commission both rechanged it and made them\n\nretroactive to a considerable degree, we will\n\nhave a big discrepancy because we will only be\n\nlooking at the change from 100 to 1 to 28 to 1.\n\nAnd so that -- Congress is most unlikely to\n\nhave wanted that.\n\nSo I would think that sometimes at\n\nleast a district court should look at other\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n59\n\nOfficial\n\nthings, such as what the Commission did with\n\nfour grams or six grams or 10 grams.

GUARNIERI:  Sure.  So I think the\n\nbest analogue here is a -- a sentence reduction\n\nproceeding in light of a retroactive guidelines\n\namendment which unfolds under 3582(c)(2).  And\n\nthat\u0027s the best analogue because that is the\n\nother circumstance in which a district court\n\nhas discretion to reduce the sentence in light\n\nof retroactive legal changes.\n\nNow there, obviously, it\u0027s a change\n\nthat the Commission has made retroactive.\n\nHere, it\u0027s Congress has created this limited\n\nretroactivity provision.  But 3582(c)(2) is\n\nprobably the best -- the closest sibling to\n\nthese proceedings.\n\nAnd in that context, it -- the\n\ndistrict court, it is not a de novo\n\nresentencing.  The court is not redoing the\n\n3553(a) factors from scratch.
