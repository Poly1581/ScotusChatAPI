page 10\n\nsays. What it says is that if there\u0027s even a\n\ndrop of money that comes -- that not from\n\nuniformed service, then you don\u0027t get the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n15\n\nOfficial\n\nexception the way -- the uniformed service\n\nexception.\n\nSo Congress in 1983 passed a broad\n\nprovision, the windfall elimination provision,\n\nwhich says \"if any part or whole of the money\n\ncomes from non-covered service, then you\u0027re in\n\nthe windfall elimination provision.\"  That\u0027s\n\nwhat they said.  That\u0027s a sweeping broad\n\nprovision that affects 1.9 million Americans\n\neach year.\n\nAnd then Congress said, we\u0027re going to\n\nenact a narrow exception only for those who are\n\nwholly in uniformed service, people who have\n\nbasically spent their career doing that.\n\nAnd so the word \"wholly\" has a lot of\n\nmeaning.  It\u0027s integral to our -- to our reading\n\nof the statute because, without it, it means\n\nthat you can have just a little bit of money\n\nfrom uniformed service and then you\u0027re entirely\n\nout of this broad windfall elimination\n\nprovision.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"13","file_name":"Babcock v.

might be a\n\ndifferent answer for Mr. Babcock.\n\nThe\n\nindividual who was the plaintiff in Martin, the\n\nEleventh Circuit case on this issue, was a\n\npersonnel clerk, so he did paperwork but still\n\nhad to be a National Guard member.  But I can\n\ntell you why we got here and maybe some of the\n\nbenefits of it.\n\nAs to the why, this is really a\n\nholdover of how states had structured the system\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\nbefore.  So, in 1916, Congress authorized states\n\nto hire military caretakers, who were the\n\npredecessors of dual-status technicians, and\n\nstates developed a practice where most of these\n\nindividuals had to be members of the National\n\nGuard.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, is it -- is this\n\njust a historical accident, or is there some\n\nbenefit to the federal government or to the\n\nNational Guard from having these people in a\n\ndual status as opposed to a -- an overlapping\n\nstatus as opposed to completely discrete\n\nstatuses?\n\nMS. REAVES: So I think the benefits\n\nare that it definitely helps the National Guard\n\nwith enrollment because these civilian jobs are\n\nvery attractive with all the benefits that they\n\nhave. And it also does help the National Guard\n\nfrom the perspective of cohesion and unit\n\nreadiness.  These individuals, you know, do get\n\ncalled up with their National Guard units and do\n\ninactive training and drills with them.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"44","file_name":"Babcock v.

KATYAL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  Three points.\n\nFirst, as Justice Gorsuch was\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial\n\nindicating, we do think that the plain text\n\ncontrols here.  There are two key features of\n\nour argument.  First, Section 415 looks to\n\nservice, not status, and, in particular,\n\nuniformed status -- service.\n\nAnd, second, Congress has specifically\n\ndefined National Guard service as uniformed\n\nservice and dual-status technician service in\n\nparticular as part of that and has labeled it\n\nmilitary.\n\nSecond, Mr. Chief Justice, he got one\n\npaycheck for his DST service, his dual-status\n\nservice.  That was -- that\u0027s petition appendix\n\npage 42a.  That is, to be sure, a civilian\n\npaycheck under Title 5.\n\nOur point is civilian pay -- where\n\nyour paycheck comes from doesn\u0027t matter for\n\npurposes of 415.  415 doesn\u0027t ask that. And,\n\nindeed, as Justice Gorsuch was saying, it\u0027s not\n\nmutually exclusive.  You can have a civilian\n\npaycheck but still be serving -- your service\n\nmay still be performed as a member of a\n\nuniformed service.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"50","file_name":"Babcock v.
