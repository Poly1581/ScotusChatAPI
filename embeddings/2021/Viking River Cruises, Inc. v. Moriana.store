Epic.\n\nAnd I think Epic correctly just reads\n\nSection 2 of the FAA as a direction to enforce\n\nthe terms of a party\u0027s arbitration agreement as\n\nwritten, unless there\u0027s some generally\n\napplicable state law that says otherwise that\n\nmakes it inapplicable.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  But Epic is, like,\n\nreally quite specific, more so than Concepcion,\n\nabout how it is that the text of Sections 3 and\n\n4 and their emphasis on certain kinds of\n\nstreamlined procedures are responsible for the\n\nEpic device.\n\nAnd, as Justice Breyer suggested, this\n\nis not essentially

let\u0027s go to the second point.\n\nIn\n\n1925, there were plenty of representative\n\nactions, arbitrations.  1925, there were\n\nrailroad arbitrations that were representative\n\narbitrations.  There were navigation, maritime\n\narbitrations.  There were agricultural\n\narbitrations.\n\nAll of them were representative.  All\n\nof them were complex.

This is not an\n\nFAA problem.\n\nMR. CLEMENT: So, Justice Kagan, it\n\nhappens to be unfair to defendants, but it also\n\nhappens to be radically inconsistent with\n\nbilateral arbitration and the resolution of\n\ndisputes through the traditional characteristics\n\nof arbitration.\n\nSo it -- it\u0027s -- it\u0027s maybe from this\n\nperspective of my clients a happy coincidence\n\nthat this anomalous claim that nobody else has\n\nthat, you know, blends procedure and substance\n\nin weird ways, I mean, you know, you keep\n\ncalling it substantive, but California calls it\n\nprocedural.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, it doesn\u0027t\n\nmatter because this is a claim that because it\n\naggregates all these multitude of claims\n\ninvolving distant employees, puts them all in\n\none proceeding, gives you class action discovery\n\nas wide as class actions, it does all that.\n\nIt\u0027s just it\u0027s -- it\u0027s nothing that\n\nlooks like the kind of thing that\u0027s suitable for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\nbilateral arbitration.\n\nAnd since Congress protected the\n\nability of parties to agree to bilateral\n\narbitration, no matter how much California\n\nthinks it\u0027s got a better way to do things, it\n\njust has to yield when it comes to people who\n\nare parties to arbitration agreements.\n\nAs to other people, as to employees","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"27","file_name":"Viking River Cruises, Inc. v.

CLEMENT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  Just a few points in rebuttal.\n\nFirst, a lot has been said about the\n\ndifferences between PAGA claims and class\n\nactions, but I think it\u0027s worth recognizing the\n\nsimilarities between an employer-wide PAGA\n\naction and an FLSA collective action.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n73\n\nOfficial\n\nI mean, the FLSA collective action is\n\na means of securing the federal wage and hour\n\nlaws on behalf of similarly situated employees.\n\nPAGA is a way for an employee to vindicate\n\nCalifornia\u0027s wage and hour laws, and it\u0027s not\n\neven restricted to similarly situated employees.\n\nIt\u0027s anything goes, the whole\n\nworkforce.  It makes no sense to say that Epic\n\ncontrols as to the FLSA collective actions, but\n\nyou don\u0027t extend it to PAGA actions.\n\nThe second point I want to emphasize\n\nis we don\u0027t care about this being representative\n\nin the sense that a state gets a 75 percent cut\n\nof the $100 violation that was provided or\n\npenalty that was provided by PAGA.  That\u0027s not\n\nthe -- the sense in which the representative\n\nnature of these cases bothers us.\n\nIt is the fact that it is\n\nrepresentative on behalf of all other employees","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"67","file_name":"Viking River Cruises, Inc. v.
