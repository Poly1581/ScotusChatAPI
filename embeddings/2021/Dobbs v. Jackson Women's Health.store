They have no\n\nbasis in the Constitution.  They have no home in\n\nour history or traditions.  They\u0027ve damaged the\n\ndemocratic process.  They\u0027ve poisoned the law.\n\nThey\u0027ve choked off compromise.\n\nFor 50 years, they\u0027ve kept this Court\n\nat the center of a political battle that it can\n\nnever resolve.  And 50 years on, they stand\n\nalone. Nowhere else does this Court recognize a\n\nright to end a human life.\n\nConsider this case:  The Mississippi\n\nlaw here prohibits abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nThe law includes robust exceptions for a woman\u0027s\n\nlife and health. It leaves months to obtain an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nabortion.

What\u0027s\n\nspecial about it?  They say it\u0027s rare.  They\n\ncall it a watershed.  Why?  Because the country\n\nis divided.  Because feelings run high. And yet\n\nthe country, for better or for worse, decided to\n\nresolve their differences by this Court laying\n\ndown a constitutional principle, in this case,\n\nwomen\u0027s choice.  All right.

They have no basis in the Constitution.\n\nThey -- they adopt a right that purposefully\n\nleads to the termination of now millions of\n\nhuman lives.  The -- if nothing had changed,\n\nthey\u0027d be just as bad as they were 30 years ago,\n\n50 years ago.

ARGUMENT OF JULIE RIKELMAN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\nMS.\n\nRIKELMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nMississippi\u0027s ban on abortion two\n\nmonths before viability is flatly\n\nunconstitutional under decades of precedent.\n\nMississippi asks the Court to dismantle this\n\nprecedent and allow states to force women to\n\nremain pregnant and give birth against their\n\nwill.\n\nThe Court should refuse to do so for\n\nat least three reasons.\n\nFirst, stare decisis presents an\n\nespecially high bar here.  In Casey, this Court\n\ncarefully examined and rejected every possible\n\nreason for overruling Roe, holding that a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\nwoman\u0027s right to end a pregnancy before\n\nviability was a rule of law and a component of\n\nliberty it could not renounce. The question\n\nthen is not whether Roe should be overturned but\n\nwhether Casey was egregiously wrong to adhere to\n\nRoe\u0027s central holding.\n\nSecond, Casey and Roe were correct.\n\nFor a state to take control of a woman\u0027s body\n\nand demand that she go through pregnancy and\n\nchildbirth with all the physical risks and\n\nlife-altering consequences that brings is a\n\nfundamental deprivation of her liberty.\n\nPreserving a woman\u0027s right to make this decision\n\nuntil viability preserve -- protects her liberty\n\nwhile logically balancing the other interests at\n\nstake.\n\nThird, eliminating or reducing the\n\nright to abortion will propel women backwards.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"43","file_name":"Dobbs v.

In fact, the majority of\n\ncountries that permit legal access to abortion\n\nallow access right up until viability, even if\n\nthey have nominal lines earlier.\n\nSo, for example, Canada, Great\n\nBritain, and most of Europe allows access to\n\nabortion right up until viability, and it also\n\ndoesn\u0027t have the same barriers in place.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"49","file_name":"Dobbs v.

it seems to me, seen in that light,\n\nboth Roe and Casey emphasize the burdens of\n\nparenting, and insofar as you and many of your\n\namici focus on the ways in which forced\n\nparenting, forced

was egregiously wrong.\n\nAnd if I may answer your earlier\n\nquestion about whether viability was squarely at\n\nissue in Casey, it clearly was, Your Honor.  At\n\npages 869 to 871, the Court squarely addressed\n\nviability because the government had made the\n\nargument that viability was arbitrary --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, I\n\nappreciate that Casey addressed it, but that\u0027s\n\ndifferent than saying it was at issue.  It said\n\nit was the central principle of Roe because it\n\nwas pretty much all that was left after they\n\nwere done dealing with the rest of it.\n\nAnd the regulations in Casey had --\n\nhad no applicability or not depending upon where\n\nviability was.  They applied throughout the\n\nwhole range, period.  So, if they didn\u0027t say\n\nanything about viability, it\u0027s like what Justice\n\nBlackmun said in -- when discussing among his\n\ncolleagues, which is a good reason not to have\n\npapers out that -- that early, is that they\n\ndon\u0027t have to address the line-drawing at all in\n\nRoe, and they didn\u0027t have to address the\n\nline-drawing at all in Casey.\n\nMS.

It would be telling the women of\n\nAmerica that it was wrong, that, actually, the\n\nability to control their bodies and perhaps the\n\nmost important decision they can make about\n\nwhether to bring a child into this world is not\n\npart of their protected liberty, and I think\n\nthat that would come at tremendous cost to the\n\nreliance that women have placed on this right\n\nand on societal reliance and what this right has\n\nmeant for further ensuring equality.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  The reliance point is\n\na -- is a good point, and this may be my fault.\n\nI\u0027m talking about pages 854 to 863 in the Casey\n\ncase.

The Court has always looked at that issue\n\nby looking at the people for whom the law is a\n\nrestriction, not those for whom it\u0027s irrelevant.\n\nSo the question is, why would women\n\nneed access to abortion after 15 weeks, and what\n\nis the effect on them?
