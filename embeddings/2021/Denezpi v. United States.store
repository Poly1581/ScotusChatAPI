and the federal government are separate\n\nsovereigns for these purposes because they\n\nderive their power to prescribe conduct from\n\ndifferent sources of authority.\n\nIndeed, there\u0027s no question in this\n\ncase that if Petitioner had been convicted of\n\nhis tribal offense in a tribally operated court,\n\nhis double jeopardy claim would fail, no matter\n\nhow much assistance that -- that tribally\n\noperated court received.\n\nPetitioner argues for a different\n\nresult here only because the Ute Mountain Ute\n\nTribe made the sovereign choice for its tribal\n\ncode to be enforced in a Court of Indian\n\nOffenses.  But the Double Jeopardy Clause\n\nfocuses on the offense, and it is silent as to\n\nthe forum of prosecution or the identity of the\n\nprosecutor.\n\nReflecting the clause\u0027s text, this\n\nCourt\u0027s decisions have likewise focused on the\n\nultimate source of authority for the offense,\n\nwhich here is unquestionably tribal, as I take\n\nPetitioner to concede.\n\nAnd the Court has rejected similar\n\ninquiries that would turn on a sovereign\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\nfunctional autonomy, explaining that they would\n\nlead to unclear and inconsistent results.\n\nBut even if the nature of the court or\n\nthe prosecutor mattered, Petitioner would fail\n\nhis own test.

the reason why is because, as this\n\nCourt recognized in Wheeler, because it\u0027s\n\nequally true, to go to some of Justice\n\nSotomayor\u0027s questions with respect to tribally\n\noperated courts, Congress has limited the\n\nsentence that can be imposed in either a Court\n\nof Indian Offenses or a tribally operated court.\n\nIt has, in fact, defined Indian courts for\n\npurposes of the

So I think because, as some of the\n\nquestions suggested earlier, the -- the Court of\n\nIndian Offenses is concerned with violations of\n\ntribal law and offenses between Indians on the\n\nreservation, and -- and so, because the tribe\n\nstill has a sovereign interest as expressed\n\nthrough the criminalization of this conduct, I\n\nthink, you know, the fact that a lesser sentence\n\nis available doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that there\n\nisn\u0027t an interest to be served there.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"33","file_name":"Denezpi v.

Just a few clarifications.\n\nFirst, our position, to Justice\n\nKagan\u0027s question, is, indeed, that if the tribe\n\ncontrols the prosecutor, we don\u0027t have this\n\nproblem.  To be clear, it\u0027s not just the\n\nappointment, but it\u0027s also that the prosecutor\n\nin turn is controlled by and answerable to the\n\ntribe so that the prosecution properly can be\n\ncalled a tribal prosecution.  In the words of\n\nSanchez Valle, that the prosecuting entity\n\nderives its power from the tribe.\n\nThat manifestly did not happen here\n\nbecause the prosecutor is answerable to federal\n\nauthorities under the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations and the United States Code.\n\nThere was some attention in my\n\nfriend\u0027s presentation to whether or not these\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"64","file_name":"Denezpi v.

page 8 of our blue brief -- is the Kewa\n\nPueblo was required to assume jurisdiction under\n\na CFR court, and that was in 2020, just 18\n\nmonths ago.  It was very, very recent.\n\nBeyond that, the Assistant Secretary\n\nfor Indian Affairs has to approve, under the Ute\n\nMountain Ute Code\u0027s constitution, any ordinance\n\nthat the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe purports to\n\nadopt. And so, in order for it to adopt the\n\nkind of judicial system that would be necessary\n\nto do away with the CFR courts, it would require\n\nthe BIA\u0027s approval.\n\nAnd beyond that, in any event, we have\n\nat page 8 of the tribe\u0027s brief and page 9 of the\n\nUnited States\u0027 brief an observation that these\n\ncourts really are only made available to the --\n\nthe tribes and Pueblos that cannot afford\n\njudicial systems of their own.
