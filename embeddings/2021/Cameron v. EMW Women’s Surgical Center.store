ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW F.\n\nKUHN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nKUHN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nTwo days after learning that another\n\nstate official had stopped defending Kentucky\u0027s\n\nHouse Bill 454, the Attorney General moved to\n\nintervene so that the Commonwealth could exhaust\n\nall appeals in defense of its law.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit kept the Attorney\n\nGeneral out of court, and it made three\n\nfundamental errors in doing so.\n\nFirst, the panel overlooked that the\n\nAttorney General simply sought to pick up where\n\nthe Secretary had left off in this litigation.\n\nMore to the point, the Attorney General, on\n\nbehalf of the Commonwealth, merely accepted a\n\nhandoff from another state official to exhaust\n\nall appeals.\n\nHeritage Reporting

to consider\n\nKentucky\u0027s sovereign interests in enforcing and\n\ndefending its law.  To be clear, the panel did\n\nnot merely weigh factors to arrive at its\n\ntimeliness holding.

In that case,\n\nthe -- the Virginia House of Delegates did not\n\nhave the authority that we have here, but the\n\nCourt talked about it as standing in for the\n\nstate.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s what we\u0027re doing\n\nhere.

Nobody else\n\nwas doing that.\n\nSo the two seems completely\n\nintertwined to me, and the Secretary\u0027s role in\n\nthe litigation prior to the Attorney General\u0027s\n\nintervention motion proves that, doesn\u0027t it?\n\nMR.

Justice\n\nBarrett?\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  I have a question\n\nthat\u0027s related to the question Justice Thomas\n\nstarted out with and that Justice Gorsuch just\n\nfollowed up on.\n\nHeritage

asked you where we get\n\nthe authority to even impose these standards on\n\nthe courts of appeal.  And I think we\u0027ve treated\n\nit as the lower court having some inherent\n\nauthority just pursuant to the judicial power to\n\nmanage its docket, and I heard you saying that\n\nwe have the authority to make sure that the\n\nrules that the courts adopt and apply are not\n\nabuses of their discretion, and that would be\n\ntrue whether we\u0027re talking about pre-judgment or\n\npost-judgment intervention.

 Thank you, Mr.\n\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Attorney General agreed to be\n\nbound by final judgment and chose not to appeal\n\nit. Because he was expressly bound by the\n\njudgment, he had a right to appeal, but he had\n\nto do so within the 30-day timeframe set by\n\nstatute.  He cannot now avoid his jurisdictional\n\nfailure by seeking to intervene instead.\n\nThe Attorney General does not directly\n\ndispute that one who is bound by judgment and\n\nfails to appeal cannot intervene.  Instead, he\n\noffers two responses, both insufficient.\n\nFirst, he argues that he is exempt\n\nfrom jurisdictional rules because he is wearing\n\na different hat on appeal than he wore when he\n\nagreed to be bound.

doesn\u0027t mean that there can be\n\nan exception to the jurisdictional rule.\n\nBut, second, under Kentucky law, the\n\nAttorney General has the authority to decline to\n\ndefend a statute.  The Kentucky Supreme Court\n\nhas held that.  And that is exactly what\n\nhappened when the Attorney General originally in\n\nthis case declined to defend the statute.\n\nAnd it is not a violation of\n\nKentucky\u0027s sovereign authority to hold him to\n\nthat decision.  As this Court recognized in\n\nBethune-Hill, the decision not to appeal is as\n\nmuch an exercise of sovereign authority as the\n\ndecision to appeal.

I mean, he\u0027s not filing a\n\nnotice of appeal.  He\u0027s seeking to intervene.\n\nIt seems like a different thing.\n\nAnd it might be that the fact that he\n\nstyled -- signed this stipulation before might\n\nbe an equitable reason or one of the\n\nconsiderations in this intervention calculation,\n\nthe Rule 24 analog for why the court might not\n\nlet him do it.

is no such thing as essentially\n\nwaiving sovereign immunity.\n\nSovereign immunity,\n\nit must be unambiguously and expressly waived.\n\nAnd this Court has held that voluntary\n\nintervention is such a waiver.\n\nAnd that\u0027s why I think it\u0027s not just a\n\nmere technicality or formality that this case is\n\n-- the intervenor is Attorney General Cameron\n\nand this case is called Cameron v. EMW. The\n\nintervenor here is the Attorney General; it is\n\nnot the State of Kentucky.\n\nAnd this Court should not construe --\n\nwhere there is ambiguity and where there is\n\nquestion of who the intervenor is, should not\n\nconstrue it as the Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\nbecause that would be an irreversible waiver of\n\nKentucky\u0027s sovereign immunity, and, indeed, the\n\nparties in this case have not even briefed the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n70\n\nOfficial\n\ncircumstances under which the Attorney General\n\nin Kentucky can waive the Commonwealth\u0027s\n\nimmunity.\n\nSo I think that it\u0027s very clear that\n\nwhat we are dealing with here is the same party\n\nwho was sued is now the party who is moving to\n\nintervene. The same party who was bound is the\n\nparty who is moving to intervene.

It took two people.  It took two\n\nconstitutionally elected, separately elected\n\nofficials to agree not to appeal further.  The\n\nGovernor\u0027s administration said no further, but\n\nKentucky created that fail-safe.\n\nI think the effect of the Sixth\n\nCircuit\u0027s ruling is to say to a sovereign state\n\nthat you just can\u0027t structure your government\n\nthat way.  You cannot defend your sovereign\n\ninterests the way that you want to do so.\n\nI think that is directly contrary to\n\nwhat this Court said in Bethune-Hill that we\n\nrespect how states structure their government.\n\nThe second and final point that I want\n\nto make is to respond to some of the questions\n\nthat Justice Gorsuch and the Chief Justice asked\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n79\n\nOfficial\n\nabout the terms of the stipulation.\n\nThis Court has told us that a party is\n\nbound -- that agrees to be bound by a -- a\n\nnon-party that agrees to be bound by a judgment\n\nis bound in accordance with the terms of his or\n\nher agreement.
