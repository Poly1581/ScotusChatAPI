ALI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Second Circuit holds that a\n\ncriminal proceeding terminates in the accused\u0027s\n\nfavor only if it affirmatively indicated that\n\nthe accused is innocent.\n\nThat is wrong.  A criminal proceeding\n\nterminates in the accused\u0027s favor when it ends\n\nand the prosecution has failed to obtain a\n\nconviction.\n\nAs this Court has recognized,\n\nSection 1983\u0027s favorable termination rule\n\nprotects against parallel proceedings,\n\ninconsistent judgments, and collateral attack.\n\nThat explains why the plaintiff in Heck had to\n\ngo off and get his conviction overturned on\n\ndirect appeal, habeas, or through a pardon.

ALI: So, Your Honor, I think that\n\nthe -- the best authority this Court has on that\n\nis Justice Ginsburg\u0027s concurrence in Albright.\n\nWe don\u0027t think the Court should get into any of\n\nthis.\n\nRemember, like just last term, the\n\nCourt decided a question about what seizures\n\nmeant, and it took 50 pages of historical\n\nanalysis to get to that result with a divided\n\nopinion.  This is an issue that Respondent just\n\ninjected into the case in the first instance in\n\nits brief in opposition.\n\nWe think what we need from this Court\n\nis a resolution of the question that was decided\n\nby the court of appeals, whether there is an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\naffirmative indications-of-innocence requirement\n\nunder Section 1983, so that we can move on and\n\nlitigate these questions about the merits.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have a quick --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nSotomayor?\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I to understand","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"26","file_name":"Thompson v.

ELLIS\n\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\n\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. ELLIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nAt common law, the favorable\n\ntermination element served three purposes,\n\nnamely, avoiding collateral tax on criminal\n\nproceedings through civil suits, avoiding\n\nparallel proceedings over guilt and probable\n\ncause, and avoiding inconsistent criminal and\n\ncivil judgments.\n\nBecause Petitioner\u0027s Section 1983\n\nclaim, like a malicious prosecution claim,\n\nthough not exactly a malicious prosecution\n\nclaim, challenges the validity of a criminal\n\nproceeding against him, incorporating a\n\nfavorable termination element would well serve","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"41","file_name":"Thompson v.
