entitlement to benefits\n\nunder the law.\n\nAnd so, for example, if a claimant was\n\ndenied benefits by DOE and then has an appeal\n\npending to the state industrial board,\n\nWashington\u0027s view of the law now is that if the\n\nclaimant is not covered by -- even if the claim\n\nwas submitted before SB 90 was enacted, if the\n\nclaimant was covered by HB 1723 but not under\n\nthe new law, the claimant will not be entitled\n\nto benefits because the new law will govern not\n\nonly new claims but additional stages in the\n\nprocessing of an existing claim.\n\nAnd it\u0027s possible that the Washington\n\ncourts will sustain that reading, but any\n\nclaimant who was covered by the prior law and\n\nnot by the new one can be expected to resist it.\n\nHeritage Reporting

HEINTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nTo protect workers on federal projects\n\nlike the Hanford cleanup, Congress passed a\n\nwaiver statute that allows states to regulate\n\nfederal contractors using all the same tools we\n\ncan use as to any private actor.\n\nThat waiver allowed Washington\u0027s\n\nformer law that is challenged here.  But,\n\nultimately, this Court need not decide this\n\nissue because this case is moot.\n\nThe federal government is asking you\n\nto issue a constitutional ruling invalidating a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\nstate law that no longer exists and that has no\n\nongoing effect.\n\nThis Court should decline and should\n\ninstead vacate the decisions below and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\nThe government concedes that there is\n\nno prospective relief that this Court can grant\n\nas to Washington\u0027s former law because the state\n\nhas already eliminated the provisions that are\n\nchallenged here.\n\nThe only reason the government argues\n\nthat there is still a live controversy is\n\nbecause it assumes that invalidating\n\nWashington\u0027s former law could still impact the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"25","file_name":"United States v.

Washington\u0027s\n\npresumption statute applies retroactively, so\n\nthe revised law will govern any pending claims\n\nfor benefits initially filed under the former\n\nlaw, even those cases on appeal.\n\nThe government speculates that there\n\nmay be individuals whose pending claims were\n\nfiled under the old law and that would not be\n\ncovered under Washington\u0027s revised statute.
