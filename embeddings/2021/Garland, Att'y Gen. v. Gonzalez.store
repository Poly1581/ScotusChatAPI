has just explained in the first case\n\nthis morning, Section 1231(a)(6) does not\n\ncompel the bond hearing regime imposed by the\n\nNinth Circuit, any more than the Third Circuit,\n\nafter the removal period, not as a matter of\n\nthe statute\u0027s text, nor as a matter of\n\nconstitutional avoidance.\n\nWith respect to the additional\n\nquestion, the courts below could not

to constitutional challenges, and any\n\nsuch limit would only encourage plaintiffs to\n\ndo what happened here, seek to avoid the bar by\n\nadvancing implausible statutory constructions\n\nunder the guise of constitutional avoidance.\n\nMoreover, the statute\u0027s exception for\n\norders granting relief to an individual alien\n\nagainst whom removal proceedings have been\n\ninitiated does not

ADAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nIt\u0027s a bedrock principle in our legal\n\nsystem that where the government seeks to lock\n\nup a human being for a prolonged period, that\n\nperson is entitled to a hearing before an\n\nindependent decisionmaker to determine whether\n\ndetention is justified.\n\nThe court of appeals was correct to\n\nread this statute to require such a hearing for\n\ntwo reasons.\n\nFirst, the text itself, it calls for a\n\ndetermination to either detain or release such\n\nindividuals, and it identifies the traditional\n\nbail hearing criteria for that decision.\n\nSecond, constitutional avoidance\n\nrequires this textual reading, as held in\n\nZadvydas.

GANNON: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nI\u0027ll start with a couple points about\n\nthe 1252(f) question.  My friend talked about\n\nanother provision that he says reads on the\n\nquestion of what operation means.  And he cited\n\n1252(a)(2)(A)(i) as a provision that refers to\n\noperation or implementation, suggesting that\n\nwe\u0027re wrong to equate those two terms.\n\nI would point out that the phrase\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\nthere is a reference to operation or\n\nimplementation of an order of removal, not of\n\nthe statute itself. And so I don\u0027t think the\n\nanalogy is quite as clear as my friend\n\nsuggests. And we do think otherwise, that\n\neverything I was saying before about the scope\n\nof this provision in talking about the way the\n\nstatute is applied and the fact that the\n\nexception is about application to individuals","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"53","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.
