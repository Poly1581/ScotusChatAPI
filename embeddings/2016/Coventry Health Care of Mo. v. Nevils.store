ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nThe issue in this case is whether FEHBA\n\npreempts State laws that forbid subrogation by insurance\n\ncarriers. The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the State\n\nrule, but we believe that is wrong for at least three\n\nreasons.\n\nNumber one, antisubrogation laws relate to\n\nbenefits and coverage, as this Court concluded in FMC v.\n\nHolliday, and at the very least, they relate to payments\n\nwith respect to benefits.\n\nNumber two, if there\u0027s any ambiguity on this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Coventry Health Care of Mo. v.

same reasons this Court\n\nconsidered in FMC in concluding that the same rule was\n\npreempted under ERISA. That is to say that it\n\neffectively requires plan administrators to calculate\n\nbenefits on the basis of different liability conditions\n\nthat vary from State to State; that very importantly, it\n\nundermines the statute\u0027s goal of uniformity; and third,\n\nthat it could encourage plan sponsors, in this case, the\n\nFederal government, to reduce the scope of coverage.\n\nIn addition to those reasons, this statute\n\ngives you an additional reason to find that it is\n\npreempted, and that is that it also preempts those rules\n\nthat relate to payments with respect to benefits.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"2","file_name":"Coventry Health Care of Mo. v.

ESTRADA: I actually was going to be the\n\nheadline on my second point, Justice Kagan. So thank\n\nyou.\n\nYou know, we recognize that McVeigh\n\nconsidered the same statute and concluded that the\n\nstatute did not give rise to a cause of action in\n\nFederal subject matter jurisdiction. And we believe\n\nthat that question was indeed difficult, because unlike\n\nERISA, where Congress expressly provided a cause of\n\naction in Section 502 of that statute, Congress had not\n\ndone so here. And the Court was basically being asked\n\nto imply common law cause of action out of the terms of\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nwhat otherwise appears to be a defensive preemption\n\nprohibition, which is relatively rare.\n\nThe background rule in the Federal system is\n\nthat Federal preemption is a defense only, as we learned\n\nin the Motley case. And the difficulty that the Court\n\nhad was in transforming what it otherwise would be a\n\ndefense into a cause of action and implying Federal\n\njurisdiction.\n\nI think that context is extremely important\n\nto understand the Court\u0027s caveat as to the text of the\n\nstatute, because the question then was will the statute\n\nwould bear a construction that was expansive indeed with\n\nrespect to an entirely different subject matter.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"5","file_name":"Coventry Health Care of Mo. v.

think we just have the\n\nbetter of the two readings of the statute.\n\nThe\n\napplication of the presumption against preemption here,\n\nI think, is really just fundamentally misguided. Not\n\nonly do we have an express-preemption provision, we\u0027re\n\ntalking about Federal benefits for Federal employees\n\nunder Federal contracts entered into under a Federal\n\nstatute. And the way this would work on the ground is\n\nif Missouri can prohibit subrogation, then what happens\n\nis that Federal workers in Illinois who are enrolled in\n\nthe same plan and paying the same premiums are footing\n\nthe bill for benefit payments they can\u0027t even keep, and\n\nit\u0027s not part of a State\u0027s traditional authority to\n\nimpose those kinds of externalities on out-of-State\n\nFederal workers.\n\nSo what I was getting at, and the answer to\n\nJustice Sotomayor\u0027s question, is that we would clearly\n\nget deference here on -- on 8902(d) in determining what\n\nare -- what are the definitions and are there\n\nlimitations on benefits available under a plan? And I\n\nthink under Chevron, it doesn\u0027t make much sense for us\n\nto get less deference in determining what is the nature\n\nand extent of benefits and benefit payments, if it\u0027s\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nreally just another way of saying the same thing.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"19","file_name":"Coventry Health Care of Mo. v.

So one thing to\n\nsay, first -- I\u0027ll answer your question, Your Honor, but\n\nthis is not an implied preemption case.\n\nNeither the Petitioners nor the government\n\nhave argued that there is a conflict that has -- that\n\nhas been created that gives rise to a form of implied\n\npreemption. Their argument is focused solely on the\n\nmeaning of scope of this express-preemption clause.\n\nNow, there could be, down the road, if the\n\ngovernment were to, in fact, enact a substantive\n\nregulation, some form of implied conflict that could\n\ngive rise to the displacement of State law, but we\u0027re\n\nnot in that world in this case today.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s actually a crucial point\n\nthat -- that what we have here is the challengers are\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"34","file_name":"Coventry Health Care of Mo. v.
