BELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\n9 may it please the Court:\n\n10 Clause (1) of the Federal Bank Fraud Statute\n\n11 premises culpability on intent to defraud a financial\n\n12 institution, and this case concerns what that element\n\n13 entails. The settled meaning of clause (1)\u0027s text based\n\n14 on a century of this Court\u0027s precedent, its fraud\n\n15 precedent, makes clear that intent to defraud a bank\n\n16 requires intent both to deceive the bank and wrong the\n\n17 bank in its own property rights. Intent to wrong a\n\n18 bank\u0027s property rights, which includes its own\n\n19 possessory rights, in bank-held property means intent to\n\n20 cause the bank, not the customer, to bear the proper\n\n21 loss of a fraud scheme.

making loans.

I mean, the\n\n15 argument may as well -- people commonly think you put\n\n16 your money in the bank, it\u0027s your money, and they\u0027ll\n\n17 give it back, but of course it\u0027s loaned out by the bank.\n\n18 But if the defendant really thinks I\u0027m not -- I don\u0027t\n\n19 want to take anything from the bank.

I don\u0027t think the court of\n\n24 appeals meant to say if you walk into the bank and tell\n\n25 the bank, you know, the nationals lost their game and\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n42\n\n1 don\u0027t have home field advantage that that\u0027s bank fraud.\n\n2 Of course, the court of appeals knows it\u0027s an order to\n\n3 obtain something from the bank. That\u0027s what bank fraud\n\n4 is. And I don\u0027t think that, you know, just as the\n\n5 heading for our brief in Section C might not have been\n\n6 fully complete, the same thing for the court of appeals\n\n7 opinion.\n\n8 But I\u0027d like to get back to I think what\u0027s a\n\n9 broader issue here, which is what is the intent\n\n10 required.
