United\n\nStates.\n\nMr. Landau.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. LANDAU: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nSection 1425(a) of the Federal Criminal Code\n\nauthorizes the government to strip a naturalized\n\nAmerican of citizenship if it was procured contrary to\n\nlaw. Our position in this case is simple. The words\n\n\"procured contrary to law\" require a causal link between\n\nthe procurement of citizenship and the underlying\n\nviolation of law. At the government\u0027s urging, the\n\ndistrict court read such a causal link out of the\n\nstatute, instructing the jury that it could convict if\n\nPetitioner obtained United States citizenship and\n\nviolated at least one law governing naturalization. The\n\ninstructions didn\u0027t require the government to prove that\n\nthe underlying violation of law had any effect\n\nwhatsoever on the naturalization decision.
