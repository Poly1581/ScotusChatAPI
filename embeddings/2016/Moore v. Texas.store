Texas.\n\n5 Mr. Sloan.\n\n6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN\n\n7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n8 MR. SLOAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held that\n\n11 the Eighth Amendment prohibits executing people who are\n\n12 intellectually disabled. And in Hall v. Florida, this\n\n13 Court reiterated that the inquiry into whether somebody\n\n14 is intellectually disabled for that important Eighth\n\n15 Amendment purpose should be informed by the medical\n\n16 community\u0027s diagnostic framework and by clinical\n\n17 standards.\n\n18 Texas has adopted a unique approach to\n\n19 intellectual disability in capital cases in which it\n\n20 prohibits the use of current medical standards. It\n\n21 relies on harmful and inappropriate lay stereotypes,\n\n22 including the so-called Briseno factors. It uses an\n\n23 extraordinary, virtually insuperable, and clinically\n\n24 unwarranted causation requirement. And most\n\n25 fundamentally, it challenges and disagrees with this\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n4\n\n1 Court\u0027s core holding in Atkins; namely, that the entire\n\n2 category of the intellectually disabled, every person\n\n3 who is intellectually disabled, is exempt from execution\n\n4 under the Eighth Amendment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Moore v.

And I think in Hall,\n\n3 this Court identified several considerations. There are\n\n4 four considerations in particular that would go into\n\n5 evaluating whether there is a sound reason for doing so.\n\n6 And the first is, is there genuinely a\n\n7 clinical consensus on that point? The second is, what\n\n8 do other States do on that point? The third is, what\n\n9 does the State do in other intellectual disability\n\n10 context? And very tellingly here, Texas uses these\n\n11 Briseno factors and this prohibition on current medical\n\n12 standards only in the death penalty context, in no other\n\n13 intellectual disability context.\n\n14 And as the Court explained in Hall, the\n\n15 condition, as the Court said in Hall, of intellectual\n\n16 disability has applicability far beyond the death\n\n17 penalty. And so when a State does, as Texas is doing\n\n18 here, treats it very differently with much more severe\n\n19 restrictions on finding intellectual disability only in\n\n20 the death penalty, it is at the very least a very major\n\n21 red flag.

KELLER\n\n20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\n21 MR. KELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n22 and may it please the Court:\n\n23 Petitioner conceded that we could have used\n\n24 the DSM-IV instead of the current DSM-5 that answers the\n\n25 question presented. And Petitioner, in their reply\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n27\n\n1 brief, says there is no material difference between the\n\n2 language in Texas\u0027s standard, which is based on the\n\n3 AAMR 9th Clinical Framework, and current clinical\n\n4 frameworks. So, essentially, this case has shifted to a\n\n5 discussion of the seven Briseno evidentiary factors.\n\n6 And if I can put those into context, the\n\n7 seven Briseno factors are all grounded in this Court\u0027s\n\n8 precedents. As we point out in our bullet-point list at\n\n9 pages 53 to 55 of our brief, what those go to are the\n\n10 second prong of the clinical definition, the adaptive\n\n11 deficits inquiry.\n\n12 All of those questions are asking, can\n\n13 someone function in the world? And that\u0027s precisely\n\n14 what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted when it also\n\n15 endorsed the Briseno factors.\n\n16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You describe these as\n\n17 coming from some source, but Briseno itself listed","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"25","file_name":"Moore v.

The\n\n11 clinicians say, no, that\u0027s sort of like stereotypical\n\n12 layperson view of adaptive functioning, which is\n\n13 different from the -- the clinical view of adaptive\n\n14 functioning. But the Briseno factors made very clear,\n\n15 sort of point one, that you\u0027re supposed to sort of --\n\n16 that you\u0027re supposed to rely on -- on what the neighbor\n\n17 said and what the teacher with absolutely no experience\n\n18 with respect to intellectual disabilities said.\n\n19 So that seems to me a very big difference\n\n20 between the Briseno factors and the clinical view of\n\n21 intellectual disability.\n\n22 MR.

And every time the DSM-5 or the next\n\n6 edition of the AAIDD 11th -- or 12th comes out, the\n\n7 States don\u0027t have to automatically wholesale about that,\n\n8 because there is a well-established three-prong test.\n\n9 This test has existed for 50 years.
