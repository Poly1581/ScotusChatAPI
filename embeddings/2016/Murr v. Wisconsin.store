KAGAN: The usual way, Mr. Groen, or\n\nat least a frequent way in which this comes up is a\n\ndeveloper buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is\n\nsplit up into 100 one-acre parcels. And let\u0027s say 15,\n\none-five, percent of them are on wetlands and can\u0027t be\n\nbuilt on. It makes an enormous difference whether we\u0027re\n\ngoing to say that those 15 percent are independent lots,\n\nbecause if they are, then the developer comes in and\n\nsays you have to pay me for all of that. But if they\u0027re\n\nnot, the developer is out of luck because it\u0027s only 15\n\npercent of the whole. Isn\u0027t that right?\n\nMR.

All the discussion about,\n\nwell, the property is valuable because it\u0027s waterfront,\n\nall of that discussion goes to the merits of the takings\n\nclaim; in other words, how much economic impact is\n\nthere? The first step is to define the relevant unit of\n\nproperty for analysis. And that step is looking at the\n\ndeeds and the -- the geographic boundaries of Lot E.\n\nThat is the presumption.\n\nWhen you turn to the valuation question, the\n\nnotion that Lot -- the combined Lot E-F has value\n\nbecause it\u0027s waterfront, that is ignoring the\n\nfundamental aspects that the valuation in a residential\n\nlot is because you can build on it. And that is what\n\nhas been taken from the Murrs. They previously had two\n\nbuilding sites; now they have one.\n\nThe valuation that the county discusses, the\n\nvalue is not attributed to Lot E, because Lot F has the\n\nbuilding site. So, really, the county is getting a\n\nwindfall by suggesting that, oh, well, you can have this\n\nbigger, better lot, and that will enable you to -- to\n\nrecover from the compensation. That goes to -- to the\n\nquestion on -- we have of how do you -- how do you\n\ndetermine the amount of damages?\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n73","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"76","file_name":"Murr v.
