FEIGIN: Well, with respect, Justice\n\nKagan, I think, as the discussion when my friend was up\n\nhere demonstrated, I don\u0027t think a court can reasonably\n\ndo that. As the Chief Justice pointed out, there might\n\nbe somebody who hasn\u0027t been in the United States very\n\nlong and doesn\u0027t have the ties that this defendant has\n\nwho says, well, all my life I\u0027ve been waiting to come to\n\nthe United States, and so it\u0027s perfectly rational for me\n\nto roll the dice.\n\nThe -- the last place I would look -- point\n\nyou to for the fact that trials are treated as\n\ninstrumental under Strickland, not as ends in and of\n\nthemselves, is the Court\u0027s most recent Strickland\n\ndecisions in Cooper and Frye, which look to the outcome\n\nof what would have happened in the combined trial/plea\n\nprocess, and in fact, find the defendant\u0027s election to\n\ngo to trial was prejudicial where there was a plea offer\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"42","file_name":"Lee v.
