Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n17 please the Court:\n\n18 The parties, both parties, and the\n\n19 government now all agree that the rule under which the\n\n20 Sixth Circuit decided this case is wrong, and that\n\n21 exhaustion is required only if the relief that the\n\n22 plaintiff actually seeks in the case is available under\n\n23 the IDEA. In light of that agreement, we think the most\n\n24 sensible way to resolve the case is simply to reverse\n\n25 the decision below and let the claims go forward.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n19\n\n1 As the Sixth Circuit pointed out, the relief\n\n2 actually sought in this case is money damages, not a\n\n3 change to the IEP, and that relief is not available\n\n4 under the IDEA.\n\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Martinez, that begs\n\n6 the last question that was asked, which is the Payne --\n\n7 you know the Ninth Circuit Payne decision.\n\n8 MR. MARTINEZ: Sure.\n\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn\u0027t do just that.\n\n10 It doesn\u0027t just look just at the relief. It looks at\n\n11 the nature of the claims and decides whether they are a\n\n12 fact claim or not, whether it is seeking a change in a\n\n13 FAPE or not, in essence in substance. So it\u0027s not\n\n14 looking at it technically as we are asking for relief.\n\n15 But it\u0027s -- it\u0027s looking at whether or not a FAPE claim","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"18","file_name":"Fry v.

I don\u0027t think -- because I don\u0027t think that the statute\n\n6 has in mind a sort of process by which either a Federal\n\n7 court or an IDEA hearing officer is given some sort of\n\n8 roving commission to go sniff out FAPE and IDEA\n\n9 violations.\n\n10 The IDEA haring process is an adversarial\n\n11 process. It depends on the parties to come together,\n\n12 bring their disagreements forward, bring evidence, and\n\n13 then a decision is made. It\u0027s not some of process where\n\n14 the hearing officer is supposed to say, well, I know the\n\n15 parties agree that there is no legal violation, but\n\n16 we\u0027re going to go ahead and maybe there is one anyway.\n\n17 And I think that -- that the rule that\n\n18 Respondents advocate here, which would require people to\n\n19 bring claims that they do not believe has merit, not\n\n20 only is it unheard of in American law, but it actually\n\n21 is inconsistent with the IDEA itself, which would allow\n\n22 for an award of attorney\u0027s fees against a parent who\n\n23 brings a claim that\u0027s frivolous, unreasonable, or\n\n24 without foundation.\n\n25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n29\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 Mr. Katyal.\n\n2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K.

MR.\n\nKATYAL: And that is my second answer to\n\n21 you.\n\n22 So the second answer is the complaint asks\n\n23 for a declaratory judgment, and that\u0027s what we were\n\n24 talking about at the beginning, to ask for declaratory\n\n25 judgment under this Court\u0027s decision in Golden v.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n43\n\n1 Zwickler and City of Lyons, the only way they can invoke\n\n2 Article III jurisdiction is by saying there is a\n\n3 reasonable prospect that the situation would occur.\n\n4 There is not a word in the complaint that says she won\u0027t\n\n5 return to the school, and indeed, the Sixth Circuit\n\n6 grapples with this all the time, when children leave the\n\n7 school and file these lawsuits.\n\n8 There is a case called Woods, which is at\n\n9 487 Federal Appendix 979, and what that case says is,\n\n10 even if you leave the school, the school has an ongoing\n\n11 obligation to keep an IEP current in case the person\n\n12 comes back to the school.\n\n13 If you adopted, if the Federal district\n\n14 court granted their declaratory judgment, the only way\n\n15 they can do so, and the only way they can invoke Article\n\n16 III processes is by saying, look, there is a chance E.F.\n\n17 might come back.\n\n18 And that happens all the time. That\n\n19 happens, you know, in the Payne case itself.

Subject to Final Review\n\n1 And the reason for that -- what is in the complaint is\n\n2 that they felt that the dog wouldn\u0027t be able to be\n\n3 welcomed back.\n\n4 And so the idea that they could allow money\n\n5 damages for this type of situation without first\n\n6 exhausting the state processes is an end-run around the\n\n7 expert agency statute that Congress set up, which they\n\n8 wanted to give states and localities the first crack at\n\n9 resolving this instead of allowing parents to abandon\n\n10 the IDEA system and march into Federal court, which is\n\n11 exactly what happened here. And I understand that there\n\n12 is awkwardness here, but that\u0027s an awkwardness of the\n\n13 statute Congress laid out.\n\n14 JUSTICE BREYER: It\u0027s not necessarily\n\n15 awkward. You -- you forgot the words \"before filing the\n\n16 complaint.\" Damages are something you get when somebody\n\n17 didn\u0027t give you something. But go back in time before\n\n18 they make that decision. At that point, what you want\n\n19 is the dog, not the money. Now if that\u0027s the truth, you\n\n20 have to go to the board. Once the board makes clear\n\n21 they won\u0027t give you the dog, at that time you\u0027re free to\n\n22 sue. You\u0027ve met any exhaustion requirement because it\u0027s\n\n23 futile.
