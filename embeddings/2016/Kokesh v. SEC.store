So the government\u0027s supposed equitable\n\nrestriction -- or at least the government has taken that\n\nposition in every court, and certainly does not\n\ncontradict that position in its brief.\n\nSo the government\u0027s view is that there\u0027s\n\nsome kind of equitable limitation that only applies at\n\nthe remedial stage after the trial and the remedial\n\nstage is already over. So the person\u0027s already stood\n\ntrial after, you know, 10, 20, 30 years after the\n\nincident. And even then, it\u0027s a pretty weak equitable\n\nrestriction.\n\nI think the recent Wiley case kind of\n\nillustrates this restriction in action where the\n\ngovernment sought 22 years of prejudgment interest at a\n\nvery high interest rate.

Well, Your Honor, first of\n\nall, I think the legal standard is that if it has\n\ncomponents of both a penal and remedial remedy, it\u0027s\n\nconsidered penal. So the question is whether it has\n\nsome penal component. I think that the answer is yes,\n\nbecause when one defines the purpose of the disgorgement\n\nremedy, it\u0027s to -- it\u0027s to create -- it\u0027s to ensure that\n\nsomeone doesn\u0027t benefit from wrongdoing. But when you\n\nsay that, you are talking about wrongdoing; in other\n\nwords, the -- the purpose of the remedy is to impose\n\nunpleasant legal consequences of wrongdoing.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\u0027s every --\n\nrestitution is that way, and you don\u0027t think of\n\nrestitution as punitive.\n\nMR.

fact, forfeiture of proceeds of illegal\n\nactivity are -- those statutes, such as 29 U.S.C.\n\n853(a)(1) are essentially identical to disgorgement.\n\nThe government\u0027s brief identifies no differences, no\n\nmaterial differences between those forfeiture of\n\nproceeds statutes and disgorgement. And when Congress\n\nenacted those statutes, it called them forfeiture.\n\nNow, it\u0027s true those statutes are pretty\n\nnew, but the reason Congress uses the word \"forfeiture\"\n\nis that it falls within the definition of a forfeiture.\n\nSo I give an example of an injunction. So\n\nschool desegregation or prison de-crowding orders, those\n\nare injunctions. They\u0027re new injunctions, they didn\u0027t\n\nexist in 1830, but they\u0027re still injunctions.

There\u0027s\n\ncompensatory payments and there\u0027s punitive payments.\n\nAnd, in fact, there\u0027s this case called Brady v. Daly,\n\nwhich, in fact, this Court held applied to Section 2462,\n\nin a subsequent case called Chattanooga, where the Court\n\nsays that a payment to a victim is remedial, and the\n\nsame payment to the government, in the context of the\n\nqui tam action, is punitive.

The\n\nquestion is -- the words \"fine,\" \"penalty,\" and\n\n\"forfeiture\" are in the Federal bankruptcy statute, and\n\nthe government\u0027s position really is that disgorgement is\n\nnot dischargeable because it is a fine, penalty, or\n\nforfeiture, but it is not a fine, penalty, or forfeiture\n\nfor purposes of the limitation period.\n\nAnd it\u0027s true that there\u0027s a separate\n\nprovision for securities disgorgements in the bankruptcy\n\nlaws, but that doesn\u0027t apply to the disgorgements under\n\nother statutes, such as the statute in which the\n\ngovernment previously took the position in this Court\n\nthat disgorgement was a fine, penalty, or forfeiture.\n\nSo I think that citizens are entitled to\n\nbasic consistency from the regulators, which doesn\u0027t\n\nseem to have happened in the context of disgorgement.\n\nAnd I\u0027d like to reserve my time.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"29","file_name":"Kokesh v.

It could still bring actions like this\n\naction, more than five years after the earliest of the\n\nbad conduct, seeking disgorgement and penalties.\n\nAnd so it\u0027s not as if the defendant would be\n\nprotected from having to defend himself against claims,\n\nfrom having to bring witnesses, from having to come\n\nforward with evidence.

So we\u0027re happy to rely on the text in\n\nthis case.\n\nI also want to talk about the dangers of\n\nthis implied remedy, because as there\u0027s some questions\n\nfrom the bench that disgorgement seems to be an implied\n\nremedy, there\u0027s no clear statutory authority. And the\n\ndanger of that is that disgorgement seems to keep\n\nmorphing in the government\u0027s briefs and positions.\n\nSo, for instance, the government always\n\nclaims, as I mentioned, in lower courts, that the\n\ncompensation is just an ancillary aspect of -- of\n\ndisgorgement, its primary function is not compensatory,\n\nand did that to beat down a whole bunch of legal\n\narguments such as the argument that private compensatory\n\nstatutes of limitations apply.\n\nAnd now in this Court, when we point out\n\nthose positions, the SEC says, well, it\u0027s sometimes\n\ncompensatory, sometimes isn\u0027t, but the fact that merely\n\nsometimes we\u0027re compensating people, that\u0027s enough to\n\nmake it compensatory enough to fall outside of\n\nSection 2462.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n66\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"69","file_name":"Kokesh v.

They don\u0027t want\n\nthat rule under bankruptcy law or tax law, because that\n\nmight decrease the amount of money that goes to the\n\nTreasury. But under Section 2462, the government was\n\nemphatic that it wants categorical rule: Disgorgement\n\nis always, 100 percent of the time, not a penalty or\n\nforfeiture under the statute.\n\nSo even in -- in these Foreign Corrupt\n\nPractices Act cases where billions of dollars go into\n\nthe United States Treasury, and there\u0027s no prospect of\n\ncompensation to victims, the government says that\u0027s\n\ndisgorgement, and so that is not a penalty or\n\nforfeiture. And that will be the government\u0027s position\n\nif it prevails in this case.\n\nAnd so I just don\u0027t think that the\n\ngovernment can define the remedy as sometimes\n\ncompensatory, sometimes not compensatory, and avoid\n\neverything.

And\n\nthere\u0027s lots of cases in which the reverse canon of\n\nconstruction has been used.\n\nSo we cite, for instance, the old Maillard\n\ncase and the old Adams case from the early Republic\n\nwhere the Court is clearly saying that there\u0027s a\n\nconstruction in favor of the statute of limitations\n\nbecause, as Chief Justice Marshall said, it would be\n\nutterly repugnant not to apply it.\n\nWe look at the Maillard case involving a\n\nvalue customs forfeiture quite similar to this case in\n\nwhich, again, the judge at the time -- it was a district\n\ncourt -- refused to apply that canon because of the --\n\nthe court\u0027s view that it shouldn\u0027t apply in these\n\nbackwards-looking remedies.\n\nAnd in fact, the Gabelli case itself I\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"71","file_name":"Kokesh v.
