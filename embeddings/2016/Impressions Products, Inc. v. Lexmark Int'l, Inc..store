were two\n\nbasic justifications.\n\nOne was statutory.\n\nThe Federal\n\nCircuit assumed that the exhaustion doctrine was\n\ngrounded in the without-authority clause in Section\n\n271(a) and that,

at all that exhaustion was a question of\n\nthe patentee\u0027s authority, rather, a flat rule. And the\n\nCourt\u0027s exhaustion we think is best looked at in either\n\nof two ways; either as a limit on the 152(a) rights, the\n\nrights to exclude that are set forth, and what the Court\n\nhas indicated is that there are a limit on the -- the\n\nscope of the patentee\u0027s right to exclude.\n\nAlso, the 1952 Act included in\n\nSection 282(b)(1) a section called Defenses that set\n\nforth defenses that could be pled. And one of those\n\ndefenses was absent of liability for infringement\n\nthereto in obvious incorporation of the preexisting\n\nexhaustion doctrine.\n\nThe Federal Circuit\u0027s second rationale\n\nconfused two concepts: The ability of a patentee to set\n\nthe terms for a first sale, and the ability to impose\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n10\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npost-sale restrictions.

think it\u0027s quite clear that\n\njust as a patentee can decide for itself who it will\n\nsell to, it can impose as a condition of licensing,\n\nmanufacturing and sales by others those same\n\nrestrictions. It can restrict who the licensee can sell\n\nto just as who it can decide to sell to.\n\nBut in either case, whether the sale by the\n\npatentee or the sale by the licensee, post-sale\n\nrestrictions are invalid as long as it\u0027s an authorized\n\nsale. Any sale by the patentee is, of course,\n\nauthorized. In the licensee context, there\u0027s an\n\nadditional inquiry: Did the licensee abide by the terms\n\nof the license? If it did, then the sale is authorized\n\nand no post-sale restrictions can be enforced.\n\nLet me turn, if I may, to the second\n\nquestion, the question of international exhaustion\n\nthat -- that this case raises. We think that the\n\nstarting point here is, again, Congress\u0027s incorporation\n\nof this Court\u0027s statements regarding the exhaustion\n\nrule. In other words, the Patent Act should be read as\n\nif there were provisions stating the initial authorized\n\nsale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to\n\nthat item. There\u0027s certainly nothing in the Patent Act\n\nthat limits exhaustion to sales by U.S. patentees within\n\nthe United States.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"9","file_name":"Impressions Products, Inc. v.

the second point I make about domestic\n\nexhaustion is that the court of appeals\u0027 err, in our\n\nview, stem to a large extent from its misreading of\n\ngeneral talking pictures. General talking pictures\n\ndealt not with a -- not with simply a restriction on the\n\nuse that purchasers could make after an article had been\n\nlawfully sold. It dealt with the conditions on which\n\nits patentee\u0027s licensee could sell the article in the\n\nfirst place. And the -- the exhaustion doctrine is\n\nalso -- often referred to colloquially as the first-sale\n\ndoctrine, and I think that\u0027s a reason -- there\u0027s a\n\nreason for that. It\u0027s that the presence or absence of\n\nexhaustion turns on whether there has been a lawful\n\nfirst sale, and if the licensee departs from the\n\ninstruction of the patentee and sells the article in a\n\nway that is not authorized, there\u0027s no lawful first\n\nsale, and therefore, no patent exhaustion. But once the\n\narticle has been lawfully sold, any restrictions on\n\nresale or use that the patentee purports to impose\n\ndownstream can be enforceable only under contract law or\n\ncommercial law, not under patent law.\n\nAnd that brings me to my third point about\n\ndomestic exhaustion, which is one of the arguments on\n\nthe other side is -- on the Respondent\u0027s side is that\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"23","file_name":"Impressions Products, Inc. v.

And the proceeds of that\n\nsale are the patentee\u0027s reward for lifting those\n\nrestraints.\n\nThat reasoning doesn\u0027t work for sales\n\noutside the United States. The sale doesn\u0027t lift any\n\nlegal restraints that otherwise would have limited what\n\nthe buyer could do, because the U.S. patent has no force\n\noverseas.
