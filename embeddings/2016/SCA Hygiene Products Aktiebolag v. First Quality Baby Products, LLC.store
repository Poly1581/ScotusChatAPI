First Quality Baby Products.\n\n6 Mr. Black.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN J. BLACK\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n9 MR. BLACK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 In Petrella, the Court reaffirmed the\n\n12 principle that when Congress enacts a limitations\n\n13 period, that courts may not apply the doctrine of laches\n\n14 to shorten the statutory period.\n\n15 In patent law, Congress prescribed a\n\n16 six-year lookback period from the date of suit and a\n\n17 20-year patent term. Injecting judicial discretion into\n\n18 the statutory scheme would frustrate the will of\n\n19 Congress, and create uncertainty about something as\n\n20 fundamental as the timeliness of suit.\n\n21 There is nothing in the Patent Act which\n\n22 compels the creation of a unique patent law rule, and if\n\n23 the Court were to create an exception here, that would\n\n24 invite litigation in the lower courts over a wide range\n\n25 of Federal statutes.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v.

The patent troll\n\n2 says, I don\u0027t think this really works, the license. I\u0027m\n\n3 going to bring a lawsuit.\n\n4 He brings a lawsuit. The judge thinks this\n\n5 is very unfair, given what the patent troll and everyone\n\n6 else had told the defendant. Laches would normally\n\n7 apply.\n\n8 And I was saying now they\u0027re going to get\n\n9 vast profit without the expense that went into making\n\n10 the profit. You say I\u0027m wrong. The reason I\u0027m wrong is\n\n11 because you only get a reasonable royalty. And in\n\n12 calculating the reasonable royalty, the judge will\n\n13 subtract the costs of producing that royalty during the\n\n14 six-year period, so you\u0027ll end up where you end up in\n\n15 copyright.\n\n16 Now, do I have the argument correctly?\n\n17 MR.

What\u0027s not been said here is two\n\n24 things:\n\n25 One is the ABA and the AIPLA, you have a\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n24\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 pretty broad brief, have both said that laches is a\n\n2 burden, that it\u0027s not necessary to deal with the patent\n\n3 trolls. They\u0027ve come out very strongly in getting rid\n\n4 of the doctrine of laches and conforming patent law to\n\n5 the other areas of law.\n\n6 The other thing is that -- the reality is\n\n7 that there aren\u0027t -- there aren\u0027t -- there\u0027s a lot of\n\n8 litigation over laches. What happens in the real world\n\n9 and the trenches is that a plaintiff files a complaint\n\n10 for patent infringement. The plaintiff seeks back\n\n11 damages. The defendant is pretty much bound to file an\n\n12 answer claiming laches. Why? Because the Federal\n\n13 circuit has said under its presumptions that, well,\n\n14 laches can apply at any time, and it applies by\n\n15 presumption after six years.\n\n16 So every case -- you have answers filed all\n\n17 the time in patent cases with laches.
