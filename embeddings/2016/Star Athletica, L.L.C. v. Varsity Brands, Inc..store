MR.\n\nBURSCH: Yeah.\n\n8 JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, the\n\n9 utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you\n\n10 in the woods.\n\n11 MR. BURSCH: Yes.\n\n12 JUSTICE KAGAN: And so -- so that function\n\n13 would not be excluded by these things.\n\n14 MR. BURSCH: Right, but the utilitarian\n\n15 function of the fabric only works -- of the design only\n\n16 works in conjunction with the useful article, and the\n\n17 same is true here. When you talk about camouflage, it\u0027s\n\n18 creating an optical illusion, right? We\u0027ve got that\n\n19 picture on page 1 of our reply brief, and when you first\n\n20 look at that, you don\u0027t immediately see that there is a\n\n21 person standing in that tree because they are\n\n22 camouflaged.\n\n23 Well, in the same way with these\n\n24 cheerleader-uniform designs, it creates the optical\n\n25 illusion that they are taller, that they\u0027re slimmer,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n24\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 that they\u0027re -- they\u0027re curvier. You know, all these\n\n2 functions work exactly the same way as camouflage.\n\n3 JUSTICE BREYER: Forget the special things.\n\n4 I have a picture of a dress now. The dress is in my\n\n5 mind. I have abstracted it.
