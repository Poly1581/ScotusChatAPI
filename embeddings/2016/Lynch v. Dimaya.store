KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\nplease the Court:\n\nThe court of appeals held that the\n\ndefinition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C 16(b) is\n\nunconstitutionally vague on its face, relying on this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Johnson, holding the residual clause\n\nin the Armed Career Criminal Act unconstitutionally\n\nvague.\n\nThat was wrong for two reasons. First, the\n\nstandard of vagueness applicable in an immigration\n\nproceeding is not the same as in a criminal proceeding,\n\nbecause the Constitution does not require prior notice\n\nthat conduct will give rise to removal and also because\n\nthe immigration laws have long been administered by the\n\nexecutive and administrative proceedings because --\n\nunder broad delegations of authority because of the\n\nclose relation of immigration to foreign relations and\n\nnational security.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Lynch v.

And that is a key\n\ndistinction between this case and Mahler, for example,\n\nwith -- with -- which Mr. Kneedler invoked.\n\nMahler was a situation in which Congress had\n\ndefined the crimes that would make you deportable. And\n\nthe problem was that the Attorney General could then\n\nexercise discretion as to whether he would deport you or\n\nnot.
