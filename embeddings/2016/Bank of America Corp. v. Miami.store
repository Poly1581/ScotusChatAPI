ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K.\n\nKATYAL\n\n9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n10 MR.\n\nKATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n11 and may it please the Court:\n\n12 The question in this case is whether cities\n\n13 can sue under one of our nation\u0027s most important laws,\n\n14 the Fair Housing Act. Our answer to that question is\n\n15 yes, sometimes, and I mean three things by that.\n\n16 First, the answer can\u0027t be yes always,\n\n17 because that would eviscerate two key doctrines of this\n\n18 Court: Proximate cause and zone of interests.\n\n19 Second, the answer can\u0027t be no, never,\n\n20 because cities can identify concrete harms that fall\n\n21 within the zone-of-interests, such as discrete\n\n22 expenditures to combat a particular defendant\u0027s racial\n\n23 misconduct.\n\n24 And third, this lawsuit fails both the zone\n\n25 of interests and proximate cause, because the injury it\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n5\n\n1 seeks to remedy is unrelated to the Act\u0027s purposes, and\n\n2 because that injury is several steps removed from any\n\n3 alleged acts of Petitioners.\n\n4 If I could start with zone of interests.\n\n5 This Court, in Lexmark --\n\n6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you -- before you\n\n7 do that, Mr. Katyal, could you please tell us: You --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"2","file_name":"Bank of America Corp. v.

They have identified an\n\n4 economic harm. So that\u0027s why this case is not within\n\n5 the zone of interest, but the one there is.\n\n6 It looks much -- you can think of it this\n\n7 way: There are kind of two lodestars in this Court\u0027s\n\n8 cases. One is the Thompson shareholder. The\n\n9 shareholder who has an economic injury, no doubt they\n\n10 are hurt by an underlying act of discrimination at the\n\n11 front end against someone who is fired, like the CEO who\n\n12 is fired for race discrimination or something like that.\n\n13 But this Court said, a-ha, that opens the door towards\n\n14 way too many lawsuits and landlords --\n\n15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a hypothetical\n\n16 the Court brought up on its own. I\u0027m -- I\u0027m surprised\n\n17 you put so much weight on Thompson because that was a\n\n18 case that upheld standing.\n\n19 MR. KATYAL: Oh, absolutely. And again, our\n\n20 opinion is fully consistent with Thompson. That is the\n\n21 language in the opinion itself. It certainly was\n\n22 something Justice Kennedy raised in oral argument and\n\n23 then picked up by Justice Breyer in Thompson. But their\n\n24 actual language and opinion does talk about\n\n25 shareholders. And it\u0027s not just Thompson.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"7","file_name":"Bank of America Corp. v.

And the measure of damages wouldn\u0027t be the\n\n22 measure of damages which they\u0027re seeking, which is\n\n23 recovery for the 2008 foreclosure crisis in Miami and to\n\n24 the tune of billions of dollars nationwide.

What the\n\n11 Court did was look at the statute, the endangered\n\n12 species statute, look at its words, and decide that \"any\n\n13 person\" meant any person and decided it did away with\n\n14 the zone of interests.\n\n15 Here, we have a Congress in 1988 taking the\n\n16 word \"aggrieved,\" which was in the -- in Title VII and\n\n17 many other statutes but undefined. And what it did was\n\n18 take the definition looked at by prior regulations,\n\n19 examined by this Court in its three cases establishing\n\n20 Article III standing, and put in a definition of\n\n21 \"aggrieved\" that is very different from the normal\n\n22 definition.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"23","file_name":"Bank of America Corp. v.

PECK\n\n2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\n3 MR. PECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n4 please the Court:\n\n5 The City of Miami brought this -- these\n\n6 cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages\n\n7 because the banks\u0027 practice of providing minority\n\n8 borrowers with more expensive and riskier loans than\n\n9 they qualified for, or that nonminority borrowers\n\n10 received, actually frustrated and counteracted the\n\n11 City\u0027s efforts on fair housing, and -- and tended to --\n\n12 to cause the City to lose the benefits of social,\n\n13 professional, and business opportunities that come with\n\n14 an integrated community free from housing\n\n15 discrimination.\n\n16 Now, you heard my friend describe these as","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"28","file_name":"Bank of America Corp. v.

Now, you heard my friend describe these as\n\n17 two buckets, that if the complaint makes that out\n\n18 clearly, then we do have standing that we fit within the\n\n19 zone of interests. We thought that the original\n\n20 complaint that we filed made this apparent. The\n\n21 Eleventh Circuit agreed with us.\n\n22 But when the district court dismissed us\n\n23 with prejudice on the original complaint, we made a\n\n24 motion for reconsideration to try to make more explicit\n\n25 what we thought was implicit in this complaint.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n30\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 As a result, the Court did deny us the\n\n2 opportunity to do that. But if you look at that amended\n\n3 complaint, it does talk about the fact that the City\n\n4 operates a Department of Community and Economic\n\n5 Development which takes complaints about fair housing,\n\n6 that tries to mediate it, that counsels, that educates\n\n7 citizens about it, and is in charge of all these kinds\n\n8 of efforts that we thought were part of our original\n\n9 complaint.\n\n10 At the same time, we recognize that the\n\n11 injury to the City is one that comes from the -- the\n\n12 failure to fall into the nondiscrimination principles\n\n13 embodied in the Fair Housing Act. And so those two\n\n14 buckets do exist in this complaint. And if they don\u0027t,\n\n15 then they do exist if we had the opportunity to amend\n\n16 the complaint and make it even more explicit.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"29","file_name":"Bank of America Corp. v.

blue brief at\n\n6 page 33 says that they do identify an interest, but they\n\n7 have to plausibly allege some impact on segregation in\n\n8 order to survive.

They haven\u0027t\n\n9 told you whether segregation is increasing or decreasing\n\n10 as a result of the bank\u0027s conduct.\n\n11 Second, the damages here they seek are way,\n\n12 way broader than what they\u0027re painted out to be. Just\n\n13 the taxes and the complaint are bad enough. Indeed, the\n\n14 Bank of America petition -- cert petition at page 34\n\n15 cites one of the complaints filed by the same counsel\n\n16 against Cobb County, seeking hundreds of millions of\n\n17 dollars.\n\n18 There are 19,300 cities in America.

And then, Justice Sotomayor, you asked him\n\n6 how to write the opinion to avoid the gardener, and his\n\n7 answer was, look at Gladstone, because Gladstone has a\n\n8 direct reduction in property values. That cannot be a\n\n9 consistent theory for this Court on proximate-cause\n\n10 principles for many reasons, one of which Gladstone is\n\n11 not a proximate-cause case at all. It\u0027s not briefed or\n\n12 argued.\n\n13 But second, even the language he\u0027s reading\n\n14 to you is only at the very end of Gladstone, saying that\n\n15 if you have a reduction in property value, then it will\n\n16 directly reduce the tax base.\n\n17 This complaint\u0027s totally different. You\u0027ve\n\n18 got five steps, as the Solicitor General\u0027s own brief\n\n19 explains, before you even get to the reduction in\n\n20 property value. Each of those are opportunities for\n\n21 intervening causes, and all the kinds of things that\n\n22 this Court in Lexmark said are the reasons why we cut\n\n23 off liability at the first step.\n\n24 Now, his other answer was to say, well, look\n\n25 at the Congressional Report. The Congressional Report\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n57\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 identifies that Congress was concerned with property\n\n2 values, and therefore concerned with cities.\n\n3 That Congressional Report also says Congress\n\n4 was equally concerned with employers who suffered from\n\n5 segregated neighborhoods, employees who were fired\n\n6 because the neighborhoods suffered from blight, and","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"57","file_name":"Bank of America Corp. v.
