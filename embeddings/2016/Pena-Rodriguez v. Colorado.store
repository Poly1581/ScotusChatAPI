FISHER: Race, this is unique in terms\n\n8 of our history and constitutional structure and in terms\n\n9 of the more practical considerations of rooting it out\n\n10 with the prophylactic measures we\u0027ve discussed. The\n\n11 briefing is filled with citations and examples of why\n\n12 race is particularly hard to get at through the Tanner\n\n13 factors as compared to even something like other kinds\n\n14 of discrimination.\n\n15 And the tiers of scrutiny analysis I think\n\n16 is a good place for the Court to look, because it\u0027s not\n\n17 that we\u0027re saying other forms of discrimination are okay\n\n18 under the constitution whereas race discrimination is\n\n19 unconstitutional.\n\n20 We\u0027re saying that different tools need to be\n\n21 available, more searching inquiries need to be done,\n\n22 when it comes to race.
