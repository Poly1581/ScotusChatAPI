EISENSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\n2 it please the Court:\n\n3 We think that this Court should locate the\n\n4 constitutional right at issue in the Fourth Amendment\n\n5 for the reason that the Fourth Amendment does apply to\n\n6 pretrial detentions as this Court has long held. The\n\n7 Fourth Amendment requires any prolonged period of\n\n8 detention to be supported by, one, valid determination\n\n9 of probable cause at the outset of that -- at that\n\n10 period of detention.\n\n11 The Seventh Circuit error here was to find\n\n12 that the Fourth Amendment stops operation once criminal\n\n13 charges are filed. And this Court has long recognized\n\n14 as well that there\u0027s a variety of ways to make that\n\n15 probable cause determination, including by the same\n\n16 procedure used to bring the criminal charge itself.\n\n17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it\u0027s a close\n\n18 question about probable cause. None of the fabricated\n\n19 evidence, just was the information available to the\n\n20 police sufficient to -- to make the arrest, and the\n\n21 court wrongly determines that there was probable cause\n\n22 and he\u0027s held for six weeks.

And to begin, I think\n\n7 it\u0027s essential to note we are not disputing at any point\n\n8 in this litigation that misstatements made that result\n\n9 in a finding of probable cause at a Gerstein hearing is\n\n10 a Fourth Amendment violation, nor does the Seventh\n\n11 Circuit disagree.\n\n12 The reason this came up to the Seventh\n\n13 Circuit as it did -- and this may be important in\n\n14 understanding the context -- this is on a motion to\n\n15 dismiss for statute -- for violation of the statue of\n\n16 limitations. All of the claims were dismissed but one,\n\n17 the one that was appealed, and that one survived\n\n18 momentarily in the district court because Petitioner\n\n19 claimed that that one claim has a favorable termination\n\n20 element because it is malicious prosecution.\n\n21 He reiterated that claim before the Seventh\n\n22 Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit reached two\n\n23 conclusions.\n\n24 One, you have a Fourth Amendment claim which\n\n25 they discuss, and that the only claim before them was\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n29\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"27","file_name":"Manuel v.

And the reason was very simple.\n\nBecause as\n\n14 this Court said in Gerstein, Fourth Amendment\n\n15 contemplates that you can have bad arrests and good\n\n16 convictions.

So I don\u0027t see why you have\n\n4 one wrong which ends on arrest, but then if you are\n\n5 continuing to be held based on trumped-up false\n\n6 information, why isn\u0027t that like a continuing tort? And\n\n7 it continues until it ends.\n\n8 MR.

If the question is why then doesn\u0027t the\n\n13 accrual period run from when one is ultimately released,\n\n14 I would make a couple of points in response to Your\n\n15 Honor\u0027s question.\n\n16 First, Petitioner has been very careful not\n\n17 to make that argument. Indeed, the continuing seizure\n\n18 idea would be inconsistent facially with the cert\n\n19 petition, which claimed they need the benefit of\n\n20 favorable termination to prevail. They, of course,\n\n21 wouldn\u0027t need it if they were instead arguing for a\n\n22 period of a continuing seizure.\n\n23 Lower courts have rejected the notion of a\n\n24 continuing seizure, and they\u0027re not raising it here.\n\n25 And I think the reason may be twofold.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n37\n\n1 The first is that it runs into -- it runs in\n\n2 the face of traditional accrual principles that this\n\n3 Court has said, cases like Ricks and others, that it\u0027s\n\n4 not the period of harm that matters for accrual\n\n5 purposes. It\u0027s when one first experiences the harm and\n\n6 thereby has all the elements needed to proceed.\n\n7 And a case like Morgan, which was a hostile\n\n8 work environment case, is really the exception that\n\n9 proves the rule. In many ways it tells us why or how\n\n10 narrowly the Court has -- has construed the exceptions\n\n11 to this typical accrual principle.

As Wallace itself concluded, there can be a\n\n21 cutoff, which Wallace imposed between the initial arrest\n\n22 and the post-process arrest, and Wallace itself in that\n\n23 regard, I think, breaks through the notion of a\n\n24 continuing seizure.\n\n25 The final point I would make -- and I think\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n38\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 this comes out in one of their amicus briefs; namely,\n\n2 the brief by Professor Alschuler -- taken to its logical\n\n3 conclusion, the logic of continuing seizure may lead one\n\n4 to conclude that the seizure doesn\u0027t end until the\n\n5 ultimate period of incarceration concludes. And what\n\n6 that means is now you have potential civil plaintiffs\n\n7 bringing claims 10, 15, 20 years down the road without\n\n8 any prior notice to the would-be defendants, no ability\n\n9 to maintain evidence and so forth.\n\n10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why do you need to give\n\n11 evidence to somebody who\u0027s fabricated the reasons why","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"37","file_name":"Manuel v.
