And I\n\nacknowledge and recognize and this Court has already\n\nsaid it\u0027s not a worldwide Constitution.

You\u0027ve said essentially\n\nit\u0027s a border area and the shot came from the United\n\nStates. So that, I take it, is your rule.\n\nSo it seems to me that the harder question\n\nis actually -- and this goes back to the Chief Justice\u0027s\n\nquestion -- why is that your rule?
