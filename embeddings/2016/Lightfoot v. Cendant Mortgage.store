So a dozen\n\n13 times since this case was first briefed, and just last\n\n14 Friday, Fannie is still arguing to Federal courts that\n\n15 this is a grant of diversity jurisdiction.

Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n21\n\n1 It\u0027s -- the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue in that case\n\n2 was the same as the one in Red Cross, and as\n\n3 Mr. Rosenkranz explained, here, Fannie Mae\u0027s charter\n\n4 used to have a sue-and-be-sued clause that looked\n\n5 exactly the same as the FDIC\u0027s, which the Court said in\n\n6 D\u0027Oench Duhme conferred Federal jurisdiction, and in\n\n7 1954, Congress changed it to mean something different.\n\n8 One of the main rationales of the court of\n\n9 appeals in this case was that the -- the work that\n\n10 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is doing is that it\u0027s\n\n11 telling you that you can\u0027t file suit in a specialized\n\n12 court, like a State traffic court or a Federal\n\n13 bankruptcy court. Well, the reason why the phrase\n\n14 \"court of competent jurisdiction\" would tell you to do\n\n15 that is because you\u0027ve got to look at the statutes\n\n16 authorizing those other specialized courts to see if the\n\n17 suit that\u0027s being brought can be brought in that\n\n18 particular court.

That was the SG\u0027s briefing in\n\n15 the Portsmouth case.

BROOKS: Yes, Your Honor. So the way we\n\n13 think all these things work together is, first of all,\n\n14 as I say, the entire phrase, \"court of competent\n\n15 jurisdiction,\" State or Federal, had been unanimously\n\n16 held to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Right?\n\n17 Those are the cases we talked about, and there were no\n\n18 cases to the contrary at the time.\n\n19 And the understanding of what \"competent\n\n20 jurisdiction\" was adding was twofold. First of all,\n\n21 from Congress\u0027s perspective at the time, I think it\u0027s\n\n22 fair to say they weren\u0027t thinking about much, because\n\n23 the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of\n\n24 Federal housing policy having very little to do with\n\n25 jurisdiction.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n32\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 And we think what happened is they simply\n\n2 borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to\n\n3 confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae.\n\n4 There was no other reason to think they meant anything\n\n5 different from that.\n\n6 But we also know that less than two years\n\n7 before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this\n\n8 Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a\n\n9 standalone basis and said that all it referred to at\n\n10 that time in that context was personal jurisdiction.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"32","file_name":"Lightfoot v.

was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley,\n\n6 the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost\n\n7 his re-election campaign.\n\n8 JUSTICE BREYER: For this reason.\n\n9 (Laughter.)\n\n10 MR. BROOKS: We -- we -- we can only assume,\n\n11 or perhaps hope.\n\n12 But in any case, 1938 was a different\n\n13 statute. The congressional charter for Fannie Mae, that\n\n14 wasn\u0027t even created in 1938. The congressional charter\n\n15 for Fannie Mae that\u0027s being reviewed today was created\n\n16 in 1948, one year after the Red Cross charter was\n\n17 adopted, and six years after D\u0027Oench, Duhme. And the\n\n18 language adopted in 1948 was the D\u0027Oench, Duhme\n\n19 language.\n\n20 So somebody has to prevail, either the\n\n21 Supreme Court unanimously in D\u0027Oench, Duhme, or the\n\n22 failed Senator Bulkley. We -- we think the answer is\n\n23 most likely this Court in D\u0027Oench, Duhme followed in Red\n\n24 Cross.\n\n25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the Federal\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n39\n\n1 courts -- may be stepping back a bit. There are courts\n\n2 of limited jurisdiction. And to get into them you have\n\n3 to carry, I think, a significant burden to establish\n\n4 their right to be there.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"39","file_name":"Lightfoot v.

BROOKS: So, Your Honor, let me begin\n\n9 where you ended, if I might, and just say that this\n\n10 Court has repeatedly held that the word -- the phrase\n\n11 \"competent jurisdiction\" again, standing alone, okay,\n\n12 has multiple different meanings depending on context.\n\n13 In the United States v. Morton in 1984, this\n\n14 Court held that it sometimes refers to subject-matter\n\n15 jurisdiction and sometimes refers to personal\n\n16 jurisdiction citing cases.\n\n17 In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.\n\n18 Guerre, which was the case decided just two years before\n\n19 our statute was decided, it said that in that context,\n\n20 the phrase only referred to personal jurisdiction.\n\n21 So I think the only way to harmonize all of\n\n22 these cases is to say that where competent jurisdiction\n\n23 is included in a phrase that has the Red Cross\n\n24 language/Osborn/D\u0027Oench, Duhme, it means all of the\n\n25 other things that \"competent jurisdiction\" normally\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n41\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"41","file_name":"Lightfoot v.

The question is, is this a good\n\n25 thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n46\n\n1 Our view basically is Congress said what it\n\n2 meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said\n\n3 that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were\n\n4 supposed to have no advantages over each other and have\n\n5 all the same powers.\n\n6 The question for this Court is: Why would\n\n7 Congress -- although it used a different language across\n\n8 multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac\n\n9 to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same\n\n10 securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC\n\n11 exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit,\n\n12 but have different Federal court litigating powers?\n\n13 There\u0027s no answer to that.\n\n14 And all we know is that in terms of the\n\n15 Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what\n\n16 we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only\n\n17 much, much bigger. So it doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense to\n\n18 imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest\n\n19 company in the United States by assets, creating housing\n\n20 across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been\n\n21 intended not to be protected by Federal court\n\n22 jurisdiction.\n\n23 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you look it up?

mean, Your Honor, there is\n\n16 no material policy different between these two agencies,\n\n17 and again, we have the legislative history that shows an\n\n18 intent to treat these the same.\n\n19 I will say that since 1974, every GSE\n\n20 statute, and there have been many, have simultaneously\n\n21 imposed identical amendments to both the Fannie Mae and\n\n22 the Freddie Mac charter. So since Freddie was created,\n\n23 Congress has never treated one differently, not in the\n\n24 \u002770s and not today.

ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I can\u0027t\n\n12 explain the position that the government has taken, but\n\n13 the government has said that those were also kind of\n\n14 drive-by jurisdictional references in cases that simply\n\n15 did not involve the question of what is the source of\n\n16 Federal jurisdiction.\n\n17 If I may, one last point on Fannie and\n\n18 Freddie. Why -- why did Congress treat them\n\n19 differently? The answer is different era, 32 years\n\n20 apart, and better lobbyists. Freddie was being\n\n21 supported and pressed by the Federal Home Loan Board,\n\n22 what used to be called the Home Loan Bank Board. They\n\n23 were ardent that Fannie was going to stop protecting\n\n24 Federal interests. They wanted an advantage.\n\n25 So Congress said, we are not giving them any\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n54\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 advantage. But case after case has held that, of\n\n2 course, Freddie has jurisdiction. And if I may, just\n\n3 one more sentence, but the vast majority of cases have\n\n4 held, before this case came along -- the vast majority\n\n5 of cases have held that there was no automatic\n\n6 jurisdiction for Fannie.\n\n7 Thank you, Your Honors.\n\n8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n\n9 The case is submitted.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"55","file_name":"Lightfoot v.
