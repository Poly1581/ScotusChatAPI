WU: Well, if I could get to that in\n\njust one second and finish the answer to Justice\n\nBreyer\u0027s, because I think given the way the statute is\n\nphrased, the easiest way to dispose of this case is to\n\nrecognize this as a direct price regulation that this\n\nCourt in 44 Liquormart and other cases have held is not\n\nsubject to First Amendment scrutiny.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn\u0027t set a\n\nstanding price. It doesn\u0027t set any price at all. It\n\nlets the merchant set the price. And the question is\n\nhow that price is described. So I think it\u0027s quite\n\ndifferent from OPA ceiling prices, which says you cannot\n\ncharge more than the ceiling price. Here, the sky is\n\nthe limit as to what the -- the merchants can charge.\n\nNew York is not regulating what the price of the goods\n\nare.\n\nMR. WU: But the way to understand the\n\nstatute -- and I think this answers Justice Sotomayor\u0027s\n\nquestion as well -- is that once the seller has chosen\n\nthat price, which I agree they have a free choice about,\n\nthen its ability to change that price for someone who\n\nuses a credit card is constrained.
