The panel believed the\n\nGeneral Assembly needed a racial target in\n\nCharleston County to achieve its political goal\n\ndistrict-wide.

And, here --\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- counsel, I\u0027m --\n\nI\u0027m sorry to interrupt, but we\u0027ve been kind of\n\ndancing around the -- the -- the -- the big\n\nquestion, which I think is, to my mind, the\n\ndistrict court\u0027s finding that -- that your --\n\nyour clients had to have looked at -- at race\n\ndata rather than politics data because the\n\npolitics data wasn\u0027t robust enough.\n\nNow you -- you\u0027ve given part of an\n\nanswer.  I\u0027d just like the full answer as to why\n\nyou think that is clearly erroneous.  Tick it\n\noff for me.\n\nMR. GORE: Sure.

The direct\n\nevidence is that everyone relied on that data.\n\nRacial data does not predict election outcomes\n\nparticularly effectively.  The correlation\n\nbetween race and politics only affects election\n\noutcomes to the extent people turn out and vote.\n\nBut racial data doesn\u0027t measure that; only\n\nelection data measures that.\n\nTheir own expert, Dr. Duchin, agreed\n\nwith that.  Dr. Duchin said that racial data\n\ncould not be used to predict election outcomes\n\nbecause you have to know about turnout, you have\n\nto know about crossover voting and other\n\nfactors.\n\nTheir own brief at page 10 concedes","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"24","file_name":"Alexander v.

That\u0027s a great question.\n\nLet me give a couple of responses.\n\nFirst of all, as you just read from\n\nCooper, the court has to consider whether it\u0027s\n\nplausible in light of the entire record and all\n\nof the evidence.  And, here, the district court\n\njust ignored other evidence that was put\n\nforward.\n\nWhat we are asking the Court to do is\n\nexactly what it did in Cromartie II.  In\n\nCromartie II, there was a plaintiff\u0027s expert who\n\ndid an analysis of VTDs moved in or moved out or\n\npotentially available to the district.  The\n\nstate also put forward an expert to give the\n\ncontradictory interpretation of that evidence,\n\nbut the district court excluded that expert.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes --\n\nMR.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThis Court has recognized that cases\n\nlike these, where state defendants disclaim the\n\nuse of race in line drawing and argue that

sensitive\n\ninquiry.\n\nAs part of that inquiry, plaintiffs\n\nbear the burden to disentangle race and politics\n\nand show that race drove the map-makers\u0027\n\ndecisions about where to place a

It ensures that racial\n\ngerrymandering cases remain focused on racial\n\ndiscrimination and not partisan disputes.  It\n\nalso ensures that the grave finding of racial\n\ngerrymandering rests on actual evidence of\n\nracial predominance and not malleable expert\n\nanalysis.\n\nIf Dr. Ragusa were correct that race\n\nbetter explains the enacted plan than politics,\n\nit should have been very easy to draw an\n\nalternative map that disentangled the two and\n\npreserved the Republican political lean in\n\nDistrict 1.  Appellees failed that requirement.\n\nThey did put alternative maps into the record,\n\nso they obviously had the capacity to do that,\n\nand all the alternative maps turned District 1\n\ninto a majority Democratic district.\n\nWe\u0027ve heard from counsel for the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"117","file_name":"Alexander v.
