That exact language that you\n\njust read came from the Sentencing Reform Act\n\nof 2015 that used the \"or\" between (A), (B),\n\n\"or\" (C).

to go back\n\nto that point. And as I understood you\n\nearlier, when Congress wanted to use the\n\ndistributive form, it generally did it. It did\n\nit in (f)(2) by using \"the defendant did not\n\nuse violence or credible threats of violence or\n\npossess a firearm or other dangerous weapon\n\nor...\"\n\nWhen it wanted to do a \"not\" in\n\n(f)(4), it wrote, contrary to Justice Kagan\u0027s\n\nexpectation, in a very cumbersome way, it said,\n\nthe statute requires a defendant was not an\n\norganizer or leader and was not engaged, and it\n\nwent on and on.\n\nSo, here, the anomaly would be\n\nCongress changing course just for this one\n\nprovision and changing \"and\" to mean \"or.\" I\n\nthink that\u0027s your basic point.  But assume that\n\nwe have two ways of reading this statute, that\n\nyou could accept that there was a possibility\n\nof reading \"or\" to mean \"and.\"\n\nWhere does the Rule of Lenity come\n\ninto this?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"34","file_name":"Pulsifer v.

question is, what does \"and\" conjoin?\n\nIt joins together three independently\n\ndisqualifying conditions by distributing the\n\nphrase \"does not have.\"  That\u0027s the only\n\ninterpretation that avoids rendering the first\n\nsubparagraph entirely redundant and the only\n\ninterpretation that assigns (f)(1) a coherent\n\ngatekeeping role.\n\nWhat\u0027s inexplicable about

That makes\n\nno sense.\n\nPetitioner\u0027s counterarguments fall\n\ninto three buckets. First, he argued in his\n\nbrief that the distributive interpretation is\n\ntextually impermissible.

if you look at\n\nthe grammar books, they say the opposite.\n\nThey\n\nsay, when \"and\" is used, even when combined\n\nwith a negative -- this is \"The Cambridge\n\nGrammar of the English Language\" -- they say\n\n\"and\" is more often distributive.

It\n\nwould -- it would be to tolerate a huge error\n\nrate if the Court simply assumed that because\n\n70 percent of \"ands\" out there are joint, we\u0027re\n\njust going to read every -- every \"and\" in the\n\nworld as joint.
