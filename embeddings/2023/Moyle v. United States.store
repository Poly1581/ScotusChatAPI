TURNER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nWhen Congress amended the Medicare Act\n\nin 1986, it put EMTALA on a centuries\u0027 old\n\nfoundation of state law.  States have always\n\nbeen responsible for licensing doctors and\n\nsetting the scope of their professional\n\npractice.  Indeed, EMTALA works precisely\n\nbecause states regulate the practice of\n\nmedicine.  And nothing in EMTALA requires\n\ndoctors to ignore the scope of their license and\n\noffer medical treatments that violate state law.\n\nThree statutory provisions make this\n\nclear. First, Section 1395, the Medicare Act\u0027s\n\nopening provision, forbids the federal\n\ngovernment from controlling the practice of\n\nmedicine.  That\u0027s the role of state regulation.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nSecond, subdivision (f) in EMTALA codifies a\n\nstatutory presumption against preemption of","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Moyle v.

BARRETT:  My question -- I\n\nhave a question about the Hyde Amendment.\n\nSo I\n\ngather from the briefing that there might be\n\nsome situations in which EMTALA would require an\n\nabortion, but the Hyde Amendment wouldn\u0027t permit\n\nfederal funds to be used to pay for it. And you\n\nsaid in your brief that EMTALA requires in other\n\ncircumstances as well stabilizing treatment to\n\nbe given that federal funds don\u0027t cover.\n\nCan you give an example of that?  And\n\nam I right about the Hyde Amendment?  And then\n\ncan you give an example of that?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So you are\n\nright about both things.  It is common under\n\nEMTALA that hospitals are going to have to\n\nprovide care where there\u0027s not federal funding\n\navailable.  And I\u0027ll give you an example of a\n\nMedicare patient who goes in and his emergency\n\nmedical condition means he needs a particular\n\ndrug that\u0027s not covered by Medicare benefits.\n\nStill, the hospital has to provide him with\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n95\n\nOfficial\n\nstabilizing treatment and give him that\n\nmedication, even though the federal funding\n\nisn\u0027t going to pay for it.\n\nAnd that also applies to people who\n\nare uninsured, who aren\u0027t covered by Medicare in\n\nthe first instance.

I\u0027m thinking\n\nhere of the provision in the Affordable Care Act\n\nthat was exclusively about abortion, and there,\n\nCongress said nothing in the ACA displaces Hyde\n\nand the other -- other federal funding\n\nrestrictions on abortion, but also, nothing in\n\nthe ACA displaces EMTALA\u0027s requirement to\n\nstabilize.\n\nAnd that shows two things.

is it true that there really isn\u0027t\n\nin operation a difference between the two -- the\n\n-- the EMTALA and what Idaho has required here?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. That is\n\ngravely mistaken on three levels.  It\u0027s\n\ninconsistent with the actual text of the Idaho\n\nlaw. It\u0027s inconsistent with medical reality.\n\nAnd it\u0027s inconsistent with what\u0027s happening on\n\nthe ground.\n\nAnd this is a really important point,\n\nso let me try to unpack this.  On the text\n\nitself, Idaho\u0027s law only allows termination if\n\nit\u0027s \"necessary to prevent death.\"  And that is\n\ntextually very narrow compared to what EMTALA\n\nrequires with the category of harm to begin\n\nwith. In Idaho, doctors have to shut their eyes\n\nto everything except death, whereas, under\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n104\n\nOfficial\n\nEMTALA, you\u0027re suppose -- supposed to be\n\nthinking about things like, is she about to lose\n\nher fertility?  Is her uterus going to become\n\nincredibly scarred because of the bleeding?  Is\n\nshe about to undergo the possibility of kidney\n\nfailure?  So I think that that is one critical\n\ndistinction.\n\nThe other critical textual distinction\n\nis the idea of necessity.  Under Idaho law, you\n\nhave to conclude that death will necessarily\n\nresult, which is also materially different, and\n\nthe Idaho Supreme Court specifically recognized\n\nit.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"90","file_name":"Moyle v.

if Mr. Turner is right about what\n\nthe state is trying to convey to hospitals about\n\nwhen they\u0027ll be prosecuted, like, why is this\n\nhappening?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that the\n\nreason this is happening is because those\n\ndoctors can look at the text of the statute\n\nitself, they can look at the Idaho Supreme\n\nCourt\u0027s decision, which made clear, very clear,\n\nthat this was a departure from prior Idaho laws\n\nthat tracked EMTALA.  And they can recognize\n\nthat their livelihood is on the line, their\n\nmedical license, their ability to practice\n\nmedicine, their freedom if they have to go to\n\njail and serve one of these minimum two-year\n\nsentences of imprisonment, and they simply\n\ncannot provide the care, even consistent with\n\ntheir subjective medical judgment, because, as a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n116\n\nOfficial\n\nmatter -- matter of medical reality, for many of\n\nthese conditions, it\u0027s not yet putting a woman\n\nat the brink of death or necessary to prevent\n\nher death, yet they know that the standard of\n\ncare is to provide her with termination because\n\nshe is just going to get worse and worse and\n\nworse if they wait it out.\n\nAnd the other important point about\n\nthis, and I think it goes back to this dual\n\nstabilization idea, is that, tragically, in many\n\nof these cases, the pregnancy is lost.

And so I think that --\n\nthe -- the lower courts did not address it.

think one of the themes on the\n\nother side is that this law passed in 1986 was a\n\nvery important law addressing a very important\n\nproblem, namely, the problem where hospitals\n\nwere turning away poor and uninsured patients\n\nHeritage Reporting

We can\u0027t allow hospitals in\n\nthis country to turn away poor and uninsured\n\npeople in emergencies.\n\nBut their theme is that the law was\n\nnot designed contextually to deal with specific\n\n-- with abortion or other specific kinds of\n\ncare. And so they make a textual argument, but\n\nI think they also make a broader contextual\n\nargument about the whole idea of what was going\n\non in 1986.  And I want to make sure -- I don\u0027t\n\nthink that\u0027s really come up too much.  I want to\n\nmake sure you respond to that.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  I appreciate having\n\nthe chance to address that.  So, at the outset,\n\nI don\u0027t think they can square that theory with\n\nthe text of the statute, which says in no\n\nuncertain terms here is the fundamental\n\nguarantee.  If you have an emergency medical\n\ncondition and you go to an ER in this country,\n\nthey have to stabilize you.  They have to give\n\nyou such treatment as may be necessary within\n\nreasonable medical probability to ensure that\n\nyou don\u0027t deteriorate.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"107","file_name":"Moyle v.

of life, but the\n\nfederal government says that EMTALA -- well,\n\nEMTALA says that the health is -- am I right,\n\nit\u0027s health and life?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  That\u0027s -- that\u0027s\n\nthe principal difference, but I think it\u0027s also\n\nthe difference between \"necessary to prevent\n\ndeath\" versus the health concerns would be\n\nreasonably expected to occur. So I think that\n\nthat is a standard that builds in a little more\n\nspace for doctors to take action.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Got it.
