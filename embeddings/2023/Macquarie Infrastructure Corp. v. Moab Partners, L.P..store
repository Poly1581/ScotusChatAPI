That text makes clear that an omission\n\nis actionable in just one circumstance, when the\n\nomitted fact is material and necessary to make a\n\nstatement not misleading.\n\nToday, you\u0027re going to hear arguments\n\nfor omission liability in a different\n\ncircumstance, when the omitted fact is material\n\nand required to be stated by Item 303. None of\n\nthose arguments is rooted in the text.\n\nThe text doesn\u0027t permit eliding the\n\nstatement requirement by treating the entire\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nmanagement narrative as misleading if one thing","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v.

Is the rule that you\u0027re asking for\n\npretty narrow?\n\nBecause the Chief and Justice Kagan\n\nare pointing out that it can sometimes be\n\ndifficult to tell when an omission causes a\n\nstatement or statements in the disclosure to be\n\nmisleading.  So Professor Grundfest suggests\n\nthat most omission cases can pretty easily be\n\nrepleaded as misleading statement cases.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial\n\nDo you agree that that\u0027s going to be\n\ntrue of some significant portion of these,\n\nmeaning that the rule that you\u0027re asking for is\n\nfairly narrow?\n\nMS.

The Second Circuit held that a violation\n\nof Item 303 is actionable independent of whether\n\nthere\u0027s a misleading statement.  And -- and we\n\nthink that rule is incorrect and needs to be\n\nvacated.\n\nNow, as far as what the -- the status\n\nquo will be going forward, and it is what the\n\nlaw is in every other circuit right now, a\n\nplaintiff must identify a specific statement.\n\nIf that happens, then, of course, the statement\n\nrequirement is satisfied and we move on to the\n\nother elements.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"11","file_name":"Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v.

understand\n\nthat. But the Chief Justice asked the very\n\nquestion that I was going to ask, which is what\n\nis the difference between a pure omission in a\n\nworld in which you\u0027re required to make a\n\ndisclosure and an omission that renders a\n\nstatement misleading?  And if you do it at a\n\ncertain level of generality, I see that there is\n\nno difference between those two.\n\nMR. FREDERICK:  And I think there is\n\nno difference except in the circumstance where\n\nyou simply don\u0027t file an MD\u0026A at all.  That is a\n\npure omission.  It is as pure as you can be that\n\nyou have violated the rule by simply not\n\ncomplying with it.\n\nNow I\u0027m told that never happens in the\n\nreal world, but that\u0027s why this whole pure\n\nomission thing is a canard for really not\n\ncapturing what is going on in a securities\n\naction, which are a series of half-truths.\n\nHere, the difference is that between\n\nthe voluntary scenario where you do have to have\n\nmore specificity about the misleading omissions\n\nand statements, where you\u0027re under a regulatory\n\nregime that requires certain disclosures and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"37","file_name":"Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v.
