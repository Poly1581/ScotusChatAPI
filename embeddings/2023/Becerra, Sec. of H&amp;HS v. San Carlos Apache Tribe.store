requires us to deduct the construction\n\ncost from the cost base when we\u0027re calculating\n\ncontract support costs.\n\nSo, translated into English, what that\n\nmeans is that if we\u0027re

One is that for many years\n\nthere\u0027s these appropriations caps under which\n\ntribes couldn\u0027t even recover contract support\n\ncosts on the secretarial amount. It took two\n\ncases from this Court, the Cherokee Nation case\n\nand then the Salazar versus Ramah Navajo Chapter\n\ncase in 2012, for this Court to hold that the\n\ntribes actually are entitled to all of the\n\ncontract support costs under the statute, and\n\nthat\u0027s when these lawsuits started being\n\nbrought.\n\nAnd the second point is the payor of\n\nlast resort provision that Justice Gorsuch\n\nraised.  So, like, that\u0027s when tribes really\n\nstarted feeling like they had to go out and\n\ncollect this money, they had no choice.  And, by\n\nthe way, it\u0027s not just the statute.
