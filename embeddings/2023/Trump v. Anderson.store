Trump is constitutionally\n\n12   disqualified from serving as president under\n\n13 Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Colorado\n\n14 Supreme Court\u0027s decision is wrong and should be\n\n15   reversed for numerous independent reasons.\n\n16 The first reason is that President Trump is\n\n17 not covered by Section 3 because the president is not\n\n18 \"an officer of the United States\" as that term is\n\n19 used throughout the Constitution.  \"Officer of the\n\n20   United States\" refers only to appointed officials,\n\n21 and it does not encompass elected individuals, such\n\n22 as the President or members of Congress.

Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin\u0027s Case and it\n\n4 goes to I think the policy concerns he talks about,\n\n5 where this was a case -- Griffin\u0027s Case involved a\n\n6 convicted criminal

Griffin\u0027s Case again?\n\n12 Section 3 refers to insurrection and raises questions\n\n13 about who decides what processes are to be used.\n\n14   That\u0027s ratified in 1868.

But your point then is it\u0027s\n\n22   reinforced because Congress itself relies on that\n\n23 precedent in the Enforcement Act of 1870 and forms\n\n24 the backdrop against which Congress does legislate.\n\n25 And then, as Justice Alito says, the historical\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n54\n\nOfficial\n\n1 practice for 155 years has been that that\u0027s the way\n\n2 it\u0027s gone.

But I think the reason why there aren\u0027t\n\n7 examples of states doing this is an idiosyncratic one\n\n8 of the fact that elections worked differently back\n\n9 then. States have a background power under Article\n\n10 II and the Tenth Amendment to run presidential\n\n11   elections.  They didn\u0027t use that power to police\n\n12   ballot access until about the 1890s.  And by the\n\n13   1890s, everyone had received amnesty and these issues\n\n14 had become moot.  So I don\u0027t think the history tells\n\n15 us --\n\n16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I\u0027d like\n\n17 to sort of look at Justice Thomas\u0027s question sort of\n\n18 from the 30,000-foot level. I mean, the whole point\n\n19 of the Fourteenth Amendment was to restrict state\n\n20   power, right?  States shall not abridge privilege of\n\n21   immunity, they won\u0027t deprive people of property\n\n22 without due process, they won\u0027t deny equal\n\n23   protection.  And on the other hand, it augmented\n\n24 federal power under Section 5.

Section 3 speaks in the same\n\n20   mandatory terms.\n\n21 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, when you look at\n\n22 -- at Section 3, the term \"insurrection\" jumps out,\n\n23 and the question is -- the questions are:  What does\n\n24 that mean?  How do you define it?  Who decides?  Who\n\n25 decides whether someone engaged in it? What\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n75\n\nOfficial\n\n1   processes -- as Justice Barrett alluded to, what\n\n2 processes are appropriate for figuring out whether\n\n3 someone did engage in that?\n\n4 And that\u0027s all what Chief Justice Chase\n\n5 focused on a year after the Fourteenth Amendment to\n\n6 say these are difficult questions and you look right\n\n7 at Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, as the\n\n8 Chief Justice said, and that tells you Congress has\n\n9 the primary role here.\n\n10 I think what\u0027s different is -- is the\n\n11   processes, the definition, who decides questions\n\n12 really jump out at you when you look at Section 3.\n\n13 MR.

President Trump had a five-day trial in\n\n12 this case.  He had the opportunity to call any\n\n13   witnesses that he wanted.  He had the opportunity to\n\n14   cross-examine our witnesses. He had the opportunity\n\n15 to testify if he wanted to testify.  And, of course,\n\n16 the process was expedited because ballot access\n\n17   decisions are always on a fast schedule.\n\n18 But, in this whole case, from the trial\n\n19 court all the way up to this Court, President Trump\n\n20 has never identified a single process, other than\n\n21   expert depositions, that he wanted to have that he\n\n22 didn\u0027t get. He had the opportunity for fact witness\n\n23   depositions.  He had the opportunity to call\n\n24   witnesses remotely.  He didn\u0027t use all of his time at\n\n25 trial. There was ample process here, and this is how\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n114\n\nOfficial\n\n1   ballot access determinations in election cases are\n\n2 decided all the time.\n\n3 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.

The first is that\n\n14   constitutional safeguards are for the purpose of\n\n15   safeguarding our democracy not just for the next\n\n16   election cycle but for generations to come.\n\n17 And -- and, second, Section 3 is designed\n\n18 to protect our democracy in that very way. The\n\n19 Framers of Section 3 knew from painful experience\n\n20 that those who had violently broken their oaths to\n\n21 the Constitution couldn\u0027t be trusted to hold power\n\n22 again because they could dismantle our constitutional\n\n23 democracy from within, and so they created a\n\n24   democratic safety valve.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.\n\n10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Barrett?\n\n11 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So the general rule is\n\n12 that, absent rare circumstances, state courts and\n\n13 federal courts share authority.  State courts have\n\n14   authority to enforce the Constitution, but there are\n\n15 certain limits to that, certain situations in which\n\n16 the Constitution itself preempts the states\u0027 ability\n\n17 to resolve constitutional questions.\n\n18 And, you know, Tarble\u0027s Case is one. And\n\n19 you said earlier that once a president is elected,\n\n20 you accepted that a state couldn\u0027t do anything about\n\n21 that, like you couldn\u0027t -- Colorado couldn\u0027t enact\n\n22 its own say quo warranto provision and then use it to\n\n23 get the secretary of state or the president or anyone\n\n24 else out of office, and I -- I assume that\u0027s because\n\n25 of this principle of structural preemption.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n118\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Am I right?\n\n2 MR.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON W.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\n21 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT GRISWOLD\n\n22 MS.\n\nSTEVENSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\n23 it please the Court:\n\n24 Exercising its far-reaching powers under\n\n25 the Electors Clause, Colorado\u0027s legislature\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n125\n\nOfficial\n\n1 specifically directed Colorado\u0027s courts to resolve\n\n2 any challenges to the listing of any candidate on the\n\n3   presidential primary ballot before Coloradans cast\n\n4 their votes.\n\n5 Despite this law, Petitioner contends that\n\n6 Colorado must put him on the ballot because of the\n\n7 possibility there would be a super majority act of\n\n8   Congress to remove his legal disability.\n\n9 Under this theory, Colorado and every other\n\n10 state would have to indulge this possibility not just\n\n11 for the primary but through the general election and\n\n12 up to the moment that an ineligible candidate was\n\n13 sworn into office.\n\n14 Nothing in the Constitution strips the\n\n15 states of their power to direct presidential\n\n16   elections in this way.  This case was handled capably\n\n17 and efficiently by the Colorado courts under a\n\n18 process that we\u0027ve used to decide ballot challenges\n\n19 for more than a century.
