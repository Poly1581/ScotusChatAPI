Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nA consent decree requires consent.\n\nThe proposed consent decree in this case,\n\nhowever, would dispose of the United States\u0027\n\nclaims without its consent.  The decree would\n\nimpose obligations on the United States without\n\nits consent.  And the decree would bind the\n\nUnited States to an interpretation of the Rio\n\nGrande Compact that is contrary to the Compact\n\nitself.  For each of those reasons, the proposed\n\ndecree should be rejected.\n\nI want to emphasize why the United\n\nStates is here today.  The Compact apportions\n\nthe water below Elephant Butte.  The Compact\n\ndoes so by incorporating and protecting the\n\ndelivery of water by the Rio Grande Project to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nMexico and to two irrigation districts, one in\n\nNew Mexico and the other in Texas. The United\n\nStates intervened in this case to enforce the\n\nCompact\u0027s protection of the project.\n\nAs New Mexico acknowledges, the\n\nCompact imposes on New Mexico a duty not to\n\ninterfere with the Project\u0027s delivery of water.\n\nThe United States claims that New Mexico is\n\nviolating that duty by allowing too much\n\ngroundwater pumping.\n\nSix years ago, this Court upheld the\n\nUnited States\u0027 right to pursue those Compact\n\nclaims, recognizing that the United States has\n\ndistinctively federal interests in protecting\n\nthe supply and the allocation of Project water.\n\nThose distinctively federal interests are why\n\nthe United States is still here today.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Texas v.

WECHSLER\n\nON BEHALF OF NEW MEXICO\n\nMR. WECHSLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe question of whether the United\n\nStates can veto the settlement of the Compacting\n\nstates can be resolved by the application of\n\nfour principles.\n\nFirst, the distinctively federal\n\ninterests of the United States do not include an\n\ninterest in the equitable apportionment of Rio\n\nGrande water.  That is undisputed.  Because the\n\nonly issue resolved by the consent decree is the\n\nequitable apportionment, the United States\u0027\n\ninterests are not implicated.\n\nSecond, the Compact establishes the\n\napportionment.  The Rio Grande Project must then\n\nconform its operations to ensure that the\n\nCompact apportionment is delivered.\n\nThird, this Court has recognized the\n\nright of states to clarify an ambiguity in an\n\ninterstate compact so long as the clarification\n\nis consistent with the Compact.  Here, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n65\n\nOfficial\n\nconsent decree measures Texas\u0027s share of the\n\nArticle IV delivery in a manner that is\n\nexpressly contemplated by the Compact.\n\nAnd, fourth, there are other available\n\nfora for the United States to resolve its\n\nremaining claims.  The Special Master observed\n\nthat \"it is difficult to envision a resolution\n\nto this matter that might be superior to the\n\nconsent decree.\"","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"57","file_name":"Texas v.

So, as the Special Master indicated in\n\ncases like Hinderlider, California versus United\n\nStates, the Court has established that the\n\nCompact -- the -- the apportionment as between\n\nthe two states is established by the Compact\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n71\n\nOfficial\n\nitself, not the operation of the Project.\n\nAnd once that apportionment is set,\n\nnow the Project must operate within that\n\napportionment. And so the amounts that the\n\ndistricts are entitled to, for example, the New\n\nMexico District, that amount, to use the\n\nlanguage from Nebraska versus Wyoming, can rise\n\nno higher than New Mexico\u0027s apportionment\n\nitself.\n\nAnd so, to the extent that the -- the\n\nProject -- or the United States has a claim\n\nconcerned about, like, are there New Mexico\n\nwater users taking water, that is purely an\n\ninterstate matter.  It\u0027s a matter of how is the\n\nNew Mexico apportionment being used.\n\nAnd that\u0027s a matter that this Court\n\nhas held, and the Special Master also is\n\nrecommending, that those questions can be\n\nresolved in the lower courts, courts that are\n\nmore appropriate or -- or more used to\n\naddressing questions of having to do with New\n\nMexico water administration, New Mexico water","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"63","file_name":"Texas v.

All these rules protect the federal\n\ngovernment from being what is an essential --\n\nessentially a direct regulation by the states.\n\nAnd the last point I\u0027ll make is -- is\n\nabout this -- this idea that the states can just\n\ncome together and resolve ambiguities in --\n\nambiguities in the Compact and then impose them\n\non the United States.
