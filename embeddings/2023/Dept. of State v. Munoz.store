So\n\nlet\u0027s take each of your points, okay?\n\nAs far back as 1888, this Court said\n\nin Maynard that getting married is something\n\nmore than a mere contract, which is your\n\nposition in your brief, that it\u0027s only statutory\n\nrights or benefits.\n\nIn 1923, this Court described in one\n\nbreath the right \"to marry, establish a home,\n\nand bring up children,\" and that right is one\n\nlong recognized at common law as essential to\n\nthe orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\n\nThat\u0027s our Meyer case.\n\nIn Loving versus Virginia, we said\n\nmarriage is fundamental.  In United States\n\nversus Windsor, we said \"marriage is more than a\n\nroutine classification for purposes of certain\n\nstatutory benefits.\"  So -- and Obergefell, I\u0027m\n\nnot going to cite it, but it said something to\n\nthat effect.\n\nSo, if I assume that there\u0027s a liberty\n\ninterest that has to be protected by some sort\n\nof process, then the question is, what kind of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"6","file_name":"Dept. of State v.

If I could just make three points.\n\nFirst, I still haven\u0027t heard a clear\n\nexplanation as to why this constitutional right,\n\nwhether it\u0027s a procedural or a substantive one,\n\nshould be limited to spouses or the effects on\n\nvisas.\n\nMy friend said that no one else other\n\nthan a spouse would have the right to petition\n\nunder the statute as it currently exists for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n103\n\nOfficial\n\nthis type of relief. But, if this is a\n\nconstitutional liberty interest underlying this,\n\nI\u0027m not sure why people wouldn\u0027t be able to say\n\nthe inability to make those petitions is\n\nunconstitutional, and so -- and no court has\n\ncountenanced that type of argument in any other\n\ncontext.\n\nSecond, my friend talks about the\n\ndomestic context, talks about what DHS does when","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"93","file_name":"Dept. of State v.
