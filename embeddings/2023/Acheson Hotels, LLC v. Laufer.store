And I take the\n\npoint that each of these is a jurisdictional\n\nissue and that there\u0027s nothing jurisdictionally\n\nprecluding us, that this is a matter of\n\nprudence.

I mean, I\n\nthink, if an individual experiences the\n\ndiscrimination on a website because they are\n\nactually trying to make a reservation, as this\n\nCourt has said in other contexts, the fact that\n\na -- an injury is widely shared does not mean\n\nthat it\u0027s not particularized.\n\nAnd then the third point was, again,\n\nabout this question about, you know, what\n\ncounts as discrimination.  I think -- I -- I --\n\nmore so in the brief, and so I -- I don\u0027t want\n\nto attribute too much of a difference here, but\n\nI think in -- we think it\u0027s very clear that\n\nCongress defined discrimination to include the\n\nfailure to make reasonable modifications.\n\nAnd so the fact that, you know,\n\nsomeone can say:  Well, my website has, you\n\nknow, the same information for all comers and\n\nshe wasn\u0027t sort of personally picked out to\n\nhave different information, I think is no\n\nanswer to the idea that this is real\n\ndiscrimination under the ADA.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"55","file_name":"Acheson Hotels, LLC v.

Congress recognized, when places of\n\npublic accommodation fail to take reasonable\n\nsteps to make their services available to\n\npeople with disabilities, they signal that\n\ndisabled people are unwelcome participants in\n\nthe marketplace and contribute to their\n\nday-to-day experience of being isolated,\n\ninvisible, and ignored.\n\nIf the Court reaches the standing\n\nquestion presented by Acheson, it should reject\n\nAcheson\u0027s argument that a disabled person does\n\nnot experience that dignitary harm when she\n\nencounters the accessibility barrier on\n\nAcheson\u0027s website, unless she also has travel\n\nplans that are thwarted by the discriminatory\n\ntreatment.\n\nFor over six decades and most notably\n\nin Havens Realty, this Court has recognized\n\nthat discrimination inflicts Article III injury\n\nregardless of whether the plaintiff experiences\n\nany harm beyond the unequal treatment.\n\nWhat it means to personally experience\n\ndiscrimination on the internet is

essentially going to be impossible or\n\nalmost impossible for a hotel to ever challenge\n\nstanding because, in the district court, the\n\nhotel would have to lose a motion to dismiss,\n\nlitigate
