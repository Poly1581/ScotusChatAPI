Appreciation in the value of a home,\n\na stock investment, or other property is not and\n\nnever has been taxed as income.  The reason is\n\nthat a gain is not income unless and until it\n\nhas been realized by the taxpayer.\n\nThe Court squarely held as much in\n\nEisner versus Macomber just a few years\n\nfollowing adoption of the amendment, and the\n\nCourt\u0027s decisions have held that line for a\n\ncentury.\n\nThat precedent makes easy work of this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\ncase. It is undisputed that the Petitioners\n\nrealized nothing from their stock investment.\n\nThey were taxed not because they had any income\n\nbut because, in 2017, they happened to own\n\nshares in a corporation carrying retained\n\nearnings on its books.\n\nThis is a tax on the ownership of\n\nproperty.  It therefore must be apportioned.\n\nDispensing with the need for\n\nrealization sweeps away what the Framers\n\nregarded as the essential check on Congress\u0027s\n\npower to tax property.  The government cannot\n\nidentify a single thing that Congress couldn\u0027t\n\ntax as income under its position that\n\nrealization is unnecessary.

You know, you buy\n\nproperty, you\u0027re holding it for 20 years, you\n\nhaven\u0027t sold it, nothing has happened.

If you point to a Sixteenth\n\nAmendment case or a case involving gross income\n\nunder -- under the Tax Code, the Court has\n\nalways looked at the individual circumstances of\n\nthe shareholder to ascertain whether or not\n\nthat -- that shareholder has actually realized a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\ngain.\n\nAnd so, for example, Indianapolis\n\nPower \u0026 Light, a 1990 case, the Court looked\n\nspecifically at the facts regarding certain\n\ntypes of customer security deposits.

ARGUMENT OF GEN.\n\nELIZABETH B.\n\nPRELOGAR\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nThe MRT is firmly grounded in the\n\nSixteenth Amendment\u0027s text and history.  The\n\namendment allows Congress to impose taxes on\n\nincomes.  That phrase had a well-established\n\nmeaning drawn from numerous preratification\n\nincome taxes that Congress enacted before this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Pollock.\n\nSeveral of those taxes were like the\n\nMRT in that they taxed shareholders on\n\nundistributed corporate earnings, including the\n\nincome taxes in 1864, 1865, 1867, and 1870.

That 1913 law taxed certain\n\nshareholders on their pro rata shares of\n\nundistributed corporate earnings. And the trend\n\nof pass-through taxation has continued\n\nthroughout the next century from taxes on\n\npartners to S Corporation shareholders, to\n\nforeign corporation shareholders under\n\nSubpart F.\n\nAgainst all that history, Petitioners\n\nstake their case on Macomber.

Macomber would control.  That\u0027s what\n\nGriffiths said.  Macomber\u0027s limited to that\n\nparticular type of stock dividend.\n\nBut the Court itself in any number of\n\nfollow-on cases had said that Macomber doesn\u0027t\n\nhave controlling weight outside that context.\n\nThe Court said in Glenshaw Glass the statements\n\nin Macomber were not intended to provide a\n\ntouchstone for resolving all future gross income\n\nquestions that could arise.\n\nSo I think, to the extent that that\n\nleaves Macomber as a bit of an island unto\n\nitself, that is just the natural effect of this\n\nCourt\u0027s subsequent precedent, and we\u0027re asking\n\nthe Court to follow that precedent here.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And the precedent\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"75","file_name":"Moore v.

I am\n\nquite concerned by the potential implications of\n\nPetitioners\u0027 argument, and you stress that in\n\nyour brief.

A taxpayer argued that because he\n\nhad been the grantor of a trust, he couldn\u0027t be\n\nheld liable for the gains in the trust, it\n\ncouldn\u0027t properly be attributed to him because\n\nhe had no continuing control and wouldn\u0027t\n\npersonally enjoy those gains, which instead went\n\nto the beneficiaries.\n\nThis Court rejected that claim, and\n\nwhat it said is that Congress had not acted\n\narbitrarily.  In making that attribution\n\ndecision, it looked at the taxpayer\u0027s\n\nrelationship to the underlying income and\n\nconcluded that there was good reason to tax the\n\ngrantor in that circumstance, including to avoid\n\nshifting income to lower-income taxpayers.\n\nBut, if the Court were applying that\n\nkind of attribution analysis here, I think the\n\nMRT, like many pass-through taxes, is equally\n\nconstitutional.  Here, the income has never been\n\ntaxed at the entity level, and there are real\n\ncomplications with trying to tax foreign\n\ncorporations directly.

Tell me why one is\n\nbetter than the other if at all, okay, but,\n\nfirst, we can say there is a realization\n\nrequirement, and, here, it was realized because\n\nthe corporation realized it.  You have to deal\n\nwith Justice Gorsuch\u0027s concern that you waive\n\nthat argument.  I may disagree with him, but\n\nthat we can work out among ourselves.\n\nBut the bottom line, we could rule\n\nthat way, or we could do it the way Justice\n\nKavanaugh started his question, which is we\n\nassume that there\u0027s a realization requirement\n\nand -- and it was met here.\n\nSo which of the two ways should we do\n\nit and -- and how not -- and why not?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  It would be\n\ncritically important for the Court to do it\n\nthrough Justice Kavanaugh\u0027s approach.  That is,\n\nI don\u0027t think the Court needs to resolve\n\nanything about whether the Sixteenth Amendment\n\nrequires realization.

want to\n\nmake sure we\u0027re on the same page -- is that this\n\ngoes back a lot of years and rolls in income\n\nfrom many past years.\n\nWhat should we say about that?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I have --\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And -- and let me\n\njust add, and he says, ultimately, if you can\n\njust roll in, I think, income at any point in\n\ntime, then that really becomes not much of a\n\nlimit at all.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  So let me react to\n\nthat in a couple of different ways.

The Ninth Circuit didn\u0027t have\n\noccasion to reach it because it ruled in our\n\nfavor on the primary income tax argument.  But,\n\nif this Court had any doubt about whether this\n\nis a proper income tax, we think the Court could\n\naffirm on the excise tax argument in particular.\n\nAnd as I had mentioned in an earlier\n\nresponse, one of the important things for the\n\nCourt to keep in mind is that 99 percent of the\n\ntax owed under the MRT is owed by domestic\n\ncorporation shareholders, large U.S. companies,\n\nfor example, that have these foreign\n\nsubsidiaries where they\u0027ve been holding money\n\noverseas for a number of years.  And this would\n\nbe a tax on the privilege of doing business with\n\nthose corporate relationships and in that\n\ncorporate form.  So, at the very least, we\u0027d\n\nurge the Court not to invalidate the MRT and all\n\nof its circumstances without proper\n\nconsideration of that argument.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  And that\u0027s because\n\nthe constitutional question is whether or not it\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n137\n\nOfficial\n\nis a direct tax, because that would be the\n\ncircumstance under which apportionment is\n\nrequired?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, exactly.

PRELOGAR:  Yes, exactly.\n\nAnd\n\nI think this relates to your earlier questions,\n\nJustice Jackson, about the meaning of Hylton and\n\nabout whether this can in any sense properly be\n\nconsidered a direct tax.\n\nYou know, ultimately, I think one of\n\nthe ways to understand the categories in the\n\nConstitution is in relation to one another.  And\n\nat the very least, this is not a tax on land.\n\nThis is not a tax on personal property.  It\u0027s\n\nnot a head tax.  Therefore, it\u0027s not a direct\n\ntax.
