BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR.\n\nFLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe government may not use coercive\n\nthreats to suppress speech, but it is entitled\n\nto speak for itself by informing, persuading, or\n\ncriticizing private speakers.\n\nLike Bantam Books, this case should be\n\nabout that fundamental distinction between\n\npersuasion and coercion.  But, unlike Bantam and\n\nthe case that you\u0027ll hear next, this is not a\n\ntypical suit where a speaker challenges\n\ngovernment actions affecting its own speech.\n\nInstead, two states and five individuals are\n\ntrying to use the Article III courts to audit\n\nall of the executive branch\u0027s communications\n\nwith and about social media platforms.\n\nThat problem has infected every step\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nof this case.  Respondents don\u0027t have standing\n\nat all because they have not shown an imminent\n\nthreat that the government will cause a platform\n\nto moderate their posts in particular. But the\n\nlower courts still reviewed a vast range of\n\nspeech by different officials to different\n\nplatforms about different topics at different\n\ntimes without asking whether it had anything to\n\ndo with Respondents.\n\nAnd the courts then entered a\n\nuniversal injunction restricting speech about\n\nany content posted on any platform by anyone and\n\nbinding thousands of officials, including\n\npresidential advisors speaking to the public and\n\nFBI agents trying to protect the nation from\n\nforeign threats.\n\nEven apart from the Article III","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Murthy, Surgeon Gen. v.

First, the Fifth\n\nCircuit radically expanded the state action\n\ndoctrine by holding that even concededly\n\nnon-coercive communications, like the CDC\u0027s\n\npublic health advice, can transform private\n\nplatforms\u0027 editorial choices into state action.\n\nAnd, second, the Fifth Circuit mistook\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\npersuasion for coercion.

Thanks.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\n\nJackson?\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I didn\u0027t\n\nperceive there to be such a sharp distinction\n\nbetween Blum and Bantam Books.  The government\n\nseems to be arguing here that Bantam Books is\n\nthe way to go, that Blum is not the right test.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd I appreciate that Blum uses\n\nsignificant encouragement, but I think it says\n\nthe question is whether the government \"has\n\nprovided such significant encouragement, either\n\novert or covert, that the choice must in law be\n\ndeemed that of the state,\" that it\u0027s sort of\n\nsuggesting in the same way that Bantam Books\n\nis that it\u0027s really about coercion, as opposed\n\nto just encouragement.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"55","file_name":"Murthy, Surgeon Gen. v.

I\u0027ve heard you say a\n\ncouple times that the government can post its\n\nown speech. But, in my hypothetical, you know,\n\nkids, this is not safe, don\u0027t do it, is not\n\ngoing to get it done.\n\nAnd so I guess some might say that the\n\ngovernment actually has a duty to take steps to\n\nprotect the citizens of this country, and you\n\nseem to be suggesting that that duty cannot\n\nmanifest itself in the government encouraging or\n\neven pressuring platforms to take down harmful\n\ninformation.\n\nSo can you help me?  Because I\u0027m\n\nreally -- I\u0027m -- I\u0027m really worried about that\n\nbecause you\u0027ve got the First Amendment operating\n\nin an environment of threatening circumstances\n\nfrom the government\u0027s perspective, and you\u0027re\n\nsaying that the government can\u0027t interact with\n\nthe source of those problems.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"107","file_name":"Murthy, Surgeon Gen. v.

was reporting on something that was\n\nalready done.\n\nAnd it\u0027s even not clear from the\n\nemail that Facebook was doing that because of\n\nany request from the government. It was a\n\nreport of its own action.\n\nAnd then his next best example is Mr.\n\nHoft and the appearance of Mr. Hoft on a\n\nspreadsheet that the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity\u0027s CISA, a sub-agency, maintains.  This\n\nappears at Record on Appeal 17,016.  And the\n\nproblem with that is twofold.  First, this is a\n\ntracking spreadsheet that monitors information\n\nsent from election officials to the platforms.\n\nThis shows that the report was made by the\n\nElection Integrity Partnership, a private\n\nentity.  It wasn\u0027t a referral that was made by\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n123\n\nOfficial\n\nCISA, the federal agency.  CISA was just noting\n\nthe existence of the referral.  And, second, as\n\nfar as I\u0027m aware, there\u0027s no indication in the\n\nrecord that the referenced piece of content was\n\nactually taken down at all.\n\nSo I think that points up that what\n\nthey just haven\u0027t shown is any injury traceable\n\nto the government, let alone an imminent risk of\n\nfuture injury.\n\nSecond, on the merits, I think it\u0027s\n\ninstructive to start with what my friend called\n\none of the hottest documents.
