this editorial control because,\n\nreally, when it comes to platforms that are the\n\ntraditional social media platforms like YouTube,\n\nInstagram, you know, TikTok, Twitter/X, it all\n\nrides -- it all turns on editorial control.\n\nIt seems to me that one distinction\n\nbetween this and FAIR is that, here, these\n\ncompanies are speech hosts, right?  I mean, the\n\nlaw schools in FAIR were hosting job fairs for\n\nthis purpose, like online recruiting.  They\n\nweren\u0027t gathering together a whole bunch of\n\npeople and saying, here, present your ideas,\n\npresent your posts.  I mean, these social media\n\ncompanies are hosting speech.\n\nSo why isn\u0027t that more like a\n\nnewspaper in Tornillo?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\nMR.

It regulates the content and\n\ndisplay of particular websites, and it tries to\n\nprevent my clients from censoring speakers and\n\ncontent.\n\nIf you are telling the websites that\n\nyou are -- that they can\u0027t censor speakers, you\n\ncan\u0027t turn around and say you\u0027re not regulating\n\nexpressive activity.  It\u0027s all over this law.\n\nAnd that brings it squarely within the teaching\n\nof Tornillo, PG\u0026E, and Hurley.\n\nAll three of those cases teach that\n\nyou cannot have the forced dissemination of\n\nthird-party speech and they reject\n\nconsiderations of market power, misattribution,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n64\n\nOfficial\n\nor space constraints.

And\n\nthe closer you look at Florida\u0027s law, the more\n\nproblematic the First Amendment problems become.\n\nIt singles out particular websites, in\n\nplain violation of Minneapolis Star.

You don\u0027t have the record for that\n\nin part because of litigation decisions that\n\nwere made by the State of Florida.  So I think\n\nwhat you would do is you would affirm the\n\npreliminary injunction, and then you would\n\nperhaps lament the fact that the record here is\n\nsomewhat stunted, and then you would make clear\n\nthat there might be a possibility to modify the\n\npreliminary injunction on -- on remand.\n\nNow, at that point, I think, when the\n\nlower court sort of sees all the details about\n\nhow these things actually operate, they might\n\nnot have the same skepticism that you\u0027re\n\nstarting with.  But I think there\u0027s lots of ways\n\nto write the decision that keeps the -- you --\n\nyou know, and, again, what\u0027s -- what\u0027s in place\n\nright now is a preliminary injunction for the\n\nbenefit of my clients.\n\nSo people that haven\u0027t sued yet, I\n\nmean, you know, the statute in theory could\n\napply to them.

the designation of a\n\nplatform as a common carrier or not has some\n\nkind of talismanic significance. But it\u0027s\n\ncompletely irrelevant to answering the First\n\nAmendment question because it\u0027s not like\n\ncompanies that are treated as common carriers\n\nhave no First Amendment rights with respect to\n\ntheir expressive activities.\n\nYou know, you can take a railroad like\n\nAmtrak and you can regulate it as a common\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n136\n\nOfficial\n\ncarrier with the transportation of passengers,\n\nbut if it creates some kind of magazine for\n\nthose passengers to peruse, that\u0027s entitled to\n\n-- to full First Amendment protection.\n\nAnd the reason that the\n\nnon-discrimination mandate in the common carrier\n\nscenario usually poses no problem under the\n\nFirst Amendment is there\u0027s no speech or\n\nexpressive activity in carrying passengers or in\n\ncarrying communications.\n\nIt\u0027s entirely different with respect\n\nto the activity that Florida is seeking to\n\nregulate because that is inherently expressive.\n\nIt\u0027s putting together literally a website with\n\npictures and video and text and arranging it.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"123","file_name":"Moody v.

It was NetChoice who insisted in\n\ndistrict court on litigating the PI very fast.\n\nIn fact, we actually wanted to slow it down and\n\ntake discovery.  And what NetChoice -- and we\n\nactually even offered to voluntarily stay the\n\nlaw while we did that. And NetChoice says, no,\n\nwe want to go fast.

And they\n\nsaid, no, we want to stay discovery even while\n\nit\u0027s on appeal.
