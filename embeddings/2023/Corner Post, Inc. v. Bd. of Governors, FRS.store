Weir.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN K.\n\nWEIR\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nWEIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nCorner Post opened for business in\n\n2018. Since then, it\u0027s paid several hundred\n\nthousand dollars in debit card fees that it\n\nthinks are unlawful.  But the government says\n\nthat Corner Post\u0027s clock to challenge those fees\n\nactually started in 2011, seven years before\n\nCorner Post pumped a single gallon of gas.\n\nThe government is wrong.  Corner\n\nPost\u0027s clock started when it swiped its first\n\ndebit card and paid its first fee.  That is the\n\nright outcome here for three main reasons.\n\nFirst and most importantly, the text.\n\nSection 2401\u0027s limitations period starts when a\n\nclaim \"first accrues.\"  This Court has said that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nphrase means the clock starts only once a\n\nplaintiff can sue, and this Court has also said\n\nthat an APA plaintiff can sue only once it\u0027s\n\nfirst harmed by regulation.  We just want the\n\nCourt to apply those settled principles.\n\nBy contrast, the government wants a\n\nspecial rule that contradicts how accrual\n\nstatutes have worked since at least the 1830s.\n\nThat government-only carveout would convert\n\nSection 2401 into a repose-based statute like\n\nthe Hobbs Act.

You would get\n\na decision.  It would be final.  It would create\n\nthe legal background rule sometimes for an\n\nentire industry, and that was the end of the\n\nmatter.\n\nAnd, you know, what you\u0027re suggesting\n\nis a very different rule than the administrative\n\nsphere has worked under for many, many years.\n\nMR.

SNYDER: So, Mr. Chief Justice, I\n\ndo want to push back a little bit on the idea\n\nthat this injury is inflicted by the government.\n\nI think the reason that they cannot assert this\n\nclaim in an enforcement proceeding is because\n\nthe government is not applying this regulation\n\nto them directly.\n\nWhat their argument is, is that the\n\ngovernment should be regulating someone else\n\nmore aggressively. And so, in that context,\n\nit\u0027s true that they have fewer rights to\n\njudicial process when what they want is for the\n\ngovernment to go and regulate someone else.  If\n\nthey were the one regulated, they would have\n\nadditional rights, and that\u0027s true in the\n\ncontext of dozens of other special statutory\n\nreview provisions as well.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, counsel, I\n\nmean, you -- you mention the enforcement action\n\npossibility, but why would banks challenge this\n\nrule?

SNYDER: I -- so -- I -- Justice\n\nKavanaugh, I think I agree with you in the sense\n\nthat 2401(a) is a catch-all statute of\n\nlimitations.  Congress adopted it as a backstop.\n\nIt erred on the side of caution in setting a\n\nlengthy six-year term.\n\nBut, in understanding how to apply\n\nthat catch-all statute of limitations to\n\nparticular types of claims, I think the way to\n\nshow fidelity to Congress\u0027s intent and\n\nCongress\u0027s expectations is to look at how\n\nCongress has approached accrual when it\u0027s dealt\n\nwith similar claims of the same type.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But -- but\n\nCongress could easily -- this is an obvious\n\npoint, but Congress could easily do that across\n\nthe board for agency actions and certainly would\n\ndo something shorter than six years if it did\n\nbecause repose has been thrown around here.\n\nThe -- six years doesn\u0027t give you much\n\nrepose to begin with if you\u0027re the government,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial\n\nat least unless this Court has -- has ruled on\n\nthe issue.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"50","file_name":"Corner Post, Inc. v.
