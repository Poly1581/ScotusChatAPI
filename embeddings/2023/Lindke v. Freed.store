FERRES: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis country\u0027s 21 million government\n\nemployees should have the right to talk publicly\n\nabout their jobs on personal social media\n\naccounts like their private-sector counterparts.\n\nAs this Court addresses the question\n\npresented, this Court should adopt the Sixth\n\nCircuit\u0027s duty and authority or state official\n\ntest because it complies with this Court\u0027s\n\nprecedent and requires that a government\n\nemployee is either exercising power possessed by\n\nvirtue of state law or made possible only\n\nbecause he is clothed with the authority of\n\nstate law.\n\nPetitioner wrongly advocates for an\n\ninherently subjective test that divorces the\n\nstate action inquiry from state law.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\nPetitioner\u0027s test will result in uncertainty and\n\nself-censorship for this country\u0027s government\n\nemployees despite this Court repeatedly finding\n\nthat government employees do not lose their\n\nrights merely by virtue of public employment.\n\nJames Freed\u0027s Facebook account is the\n\nperfect example of the danger of Petitioner\u0027s\n\ntest. Mr. Freed opened a personal Facebook\n\ncount in -- account in 2008 as a college student","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"31","file_name":"Lindke v.

that takes\n\naway from the Griffin case because a private\n\ncitizen can choose to make an arrest.  So can a\n\ndeputy choose to make an arrest. What changed\n\nit in Griffin was the fact that he was wearing\n\nthe deputy badge and purporting to act as a\n\ngovernment official.\n\nSimilarly here, he\u0027s disclosing\n\ninformation that\u0027s private to his job and using\n\nthe site to make people realize or believe that\n\nhe is performing a social function by being the\n\nfirst to give them the news.\n\nMS. HANSFORD:  So, Justice Sotomayor,\n\nwhen you\u0027re conducting an arrest or ordering\n\nsomebody to leave, exercising governmental\n\nauthority and appearing to be exercising\n\ngovernmental authority changes the nature of\n\nwhat you\u0027re doing.  It\u0027s giving you additional\n\npower that a private rent-a-cop does not have to\n\nobtain compliance.\n\nAnd so we think the analogy to the\n\nGriffin case would be, if Mr. Freed went on\n\nFacebook and said, by the authority of city\n\nmanager, I hereby order everybody to stay at\n\nhome under penalty of fines, and then the fact\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n74\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"66","file_name":"Lindke v.
