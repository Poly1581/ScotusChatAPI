I think\n\nthe question of jurisdiction is just\n\nconceptually distinct from the question of\n\nwhether there\u0027s a cause of action, whether\n\nthere\u0027s a right to a remedy.\n\nCongress could

\"retain for\n\nitself, the power to hear and determine\n\ncontroversies respecting claims against the\n\nUnited States.\"  It follows that, again, a\n\nquote, \"there is no constitutional right to

It\u0027s not a right to\n\ncompensation.  And this -- it\u0027s prohibitory.  It\n\nhas a condition for the -- governmental action\n\nto be lawful.
