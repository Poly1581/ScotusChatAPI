CEDRONE\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. CEDRONE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe 60-day time period in the\n\nvoluntary departure statute works like any\n\nroutine legal time period.  When the last day\n\nfalls on a weekend or holiday, the period\n\ncontinues to run until the next business day.\n\nCongress would have expected people to\n\nread the statute this way. In 1996, common law\n\nprinciples, case law, established rules and\n\nregulations, and years of consistent practice\n\nall pointed to that interpretation.  If Congress\n\nhad meant to deviate from that traditional\n\nunderstanding, it would have said so.\n\nEven the government now acknowledges\n\nthat other deadlines in the same section of\n\nIIRIRA follow the traditional rule in light of a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nlong-standing immigration regulation defining\n\nthe word \"day.\" So the only way to adopt the\n\ngovernment\u0027s interpretation is to believe that\n\nCongress used two different meanings of the word\n\n\"day\" in the same section of the same statute.\n\nThere\u0027s simply no indication that Congress took\n\nthat kind of split approach.\n\nThe government\u0027s interpretation would\n\nalso spell chaos for regulatory definitions and\n\ndeadlines.

So the way I\n\nwould frame the principle generally is that\n\nthere are certain days, you can call them --\n\ncertain legally recognized days of rest.  You\n\ncan call them non-business days. You can use\n\nthe Latin term dies non juridicus.  That\n\nprinciple recognizes that when a deadline or\n\ntime period expires on one of those legally\n\nrecognized days of rest, it carries over to the\n\nnext day.\n\nBut the days that are legally\n\nrecognized days of rest can change over time.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"7","file_name":"Velazquez v.

jurisdiction, Justice Sotomayor\n\npointed out that this seems to be a one-off\n\ncase.\n\nI just want to clarify with you -- and\n\nthe government can speak to this too if the\n\nanswer is different

Is -- is this very\n\nunusual so that this jurisdictional question\n\nwouldn\u0027t really frequently arise?\n\nMR.

I don\u0027t see any support for that\n\nin the statute.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.\n\nMy question\n\non the merits.\n\nMost of the time when we think about\n\nthis, and as I understand the regulatory\n\nbackdrop, when we\u0027re thinking about filing\n\nsomething, the reason why it gets bumped over\n\nto, say, a Monday from a Saturday is that the\n\ncourt\u0027s closed.  But could your client have\n\ndeparted on a Saturday?\n\nIt just -- that -- that strikes me as\n\nthe difference here, that this isn\u0027t governing\n\nfiling dates or something that you\u0027re doing.\n\nIt\u0027s just saying that your authorization to be\n\nin the country expires, you know, at that 60-day\n\nmark.\n\nAnd it\u0027s not that the court was\n\nclosed.

This principle is deeper than that,\n\nand there are several indications that this\n\nprinciple is not just about court closures or\n\nfilings.  I think the best evidence of that is\n\nto go -- I\u0027ll start with the regulation and work\n\noutwards.\n\nSo the regulatory definition of \"day\"","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"15","file_name":"Velazquez v.

It\u0027s also meant to capture the way\n\nthat things work out in the world, in business,\n\nin society.\n\nAnd so just one concrete example.  The\n\nmotion that was filed in this case was sent by\n\nFedEx priority overnight on a Friday.  That\n\nmeans it gets there Monday morning.
