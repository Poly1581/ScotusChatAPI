DEGER-SEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn Section 1154(c), Congress\n\nunequivocally stated that no petition shall be\n\napproved if the beneficiary engaged in a sham\n\nmarriage.  In context, that requirement applies\n\nnot just to the day of approval but to the next\n\nday as well.  In other words, the petition\n\ncannot remain approved if the agency reconsiders\n\nits initial decision and concludes that there\n\nwas a sham marriage.\n\nThat\u0027s because an approved visa\n\npetition confers no substantive benefits.  It is\n\nsimply a piece of paper signifying that a\n\nbeneficiary is eligible to apply for a green\n\ncard.

So what the\n\ngovernment does in these situations is, when\n\nthey discover that there has been a sham\n\nmarriage, they -- as far as we can tell, their\n\nuniform practice is to revoke.\n\nAnd if you look at the actual\n\ndecisions, the decisions all read like decisions\n\nthat are non-discretionary.

DEGER-SEN: Well, I mean, I think\n\nas long as what they would be able to do then is\n\nto allow someone to be eligible for the green\n\ncard. I think what they\u0027re saying is we believe\n\nthat we can just still deny green cards.  And we\n\ndon\u0027t believe that the government can do that\n\nbecause the only place where this criteria\n\nexists, 1154(c), is at the petition approval\n\nstage.\n\nSo what the -- what -- what -- what\n\nthe -- what a valid petition says, what a\n\nnon-revoked petition says is it says you are\n\neligible for a green card. You have not engaged\n\nin a sham marriage.  That\u0027s something you\u0027ve not\n\ndone. That\u0027s what it\u0027s signifying to the\n\nagency.\n\nSo then I think, if the agency says,\n\nwell, you have that, so you\u0027ve not engaged in a\n\nsham marriage, even though it separately found\n\nthat you have, we\u0027re going to exercise our\n\ndiscretion to allow you to go ahead into the\n\nprocess and get a green card, that would be a\n\nmeaningful kind of discretion.  But I don\u0027t\n\nthink that\u0027s what the government is suggesting\n\nas the kind of discretion it has.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"16","file_name":"Bouarfa v.

SINZDAK: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThere were more than 900,000 I-130\n\nvisa petitions filed last year, and USCIS\n\ngranted, denied, or revoked more than 800,000\n\nsuch petitions.  Given this volume, Congress had\n\nevery reason to streamline judicial review by\n\nprohibiting litigation at the revocation stage.\n\nAnd, to be clear, the government\n\nbelieves that Congress did prohibit litigation\n\nby making revocations discretionary, including\n\nin the face of a sham-marriage determination.\n\nThe government does not view a revocation as\n\nmandatory in that stage, and I am not aware of a\n\nlongstanding position of the kind that counsel\n\nsuggests.\n\nThe text is very clear on this.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nSection 1252 bars review of actions, the\n\nauthority for which is specified to be in the\n\ndiscretion of the Secretary of Homeland","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"33","file_name":"Bouarfa v.
