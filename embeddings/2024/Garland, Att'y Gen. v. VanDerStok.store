imposes\n\nstraightforward but essential requirements.\n\nFirearms sellers and manufacturers must mark\n\ntheir products with serial numbers, maintain\n\nsales records, and conduct background checks.\n\nThe industry has followed those conditions\n\nwithout difficulty for more than half a century,\n\nand those basic requirements are crucial to\n\nsolving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the\n\nhands of minors, felons, and domestic abusers.\n\nBut, in recent years, companies like\n\nthe Respondents here have tried to circumvent\n\nthose requirements.  They\u0027ve begun selling\n\nfirearms as easy-to-assemble kits and frames and\n\nreceivers that require minimal work to be made\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfunctional.  They\u0027ve advertised the products, in\n\ntheir words, as \"ridiculously easy to assemble\n\nand dummy-proof\" and touted that you can go from\n\nopening the mail to have a fully functional gun\n\nin as little as 15 minutes, no serial number,\n\nbackground check, or records required.\n\nThose untraceable guns are attractive\n\nto people who can\u0027t lawfully purchase them or\n\nwho plan to use them in crimes. As a result,\n\nour nation has seen an explosion in crimes\n\ncommitted with ghost guns.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"2","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.

is\n\nthat Congress can use a variety of verbal\n\nformulations to cover similar types of conduct.\n\nEach of these other definitions that Respondents\n\nhave pointed to that refer explicitly to

doing is\n\nignoring the language of the statute that\n\nCongress did use in 1968, and it expressly\n\nreferred to things that can be readily converted\n\nto function to expel a projectile through

something that\u0027s readily\n\nconvertible.  As I understand it, to make a\n\nstarter gun operable, you either have to replace\n\nthe bore, so you need a new bore part to do\n\nthat, or you have to drill out the existing bore\n\non the starter gun and get a pin to make it\n\noperable, correct?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  That\u0027s right.  So\n\nthe most commonly publicized example that I\n\nthink was top of mind for Congress, and it\u0027s one\n\nthat\u0027s cited in the statutory history here, was\n\nthe example of a -- a gang member who bought the\n\nstarter guns in bulk and then, you\u0027re exactly\n\nright, had to drill out the plugged barrel or\n\nelse cut it off and rethread it and put in a new\n\nbarrel.

There are\n\nusually only a couple of steps.  The first thing\n\nthat most of the kits require is drilling the\n\nholes. Usually, it\u0027s six holes, and you do it\n\nwith a jig.

So\n\nI want to be really clear about our\n\ninterpretation of the statute.  We are not\n\nsuggesting that a statutory reference to one\n\nthing includes all other separate and distinct\n\nthings that might be readily converted into the\n\nthing that\u0027s listed in the statute itself.\n\nSo the example we give in our reply\n\nbrief is that a pair of pants is not regulated\n\nas a pair of shorts if you have a statute\n\nreferring to shorts even though the pants could\n\nbe readily converted into shorts.  That\u0027s\n\nbecause pants are a distinct object in their own\n\nright and they have a separate identity.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd the rule itself incorporates this\n\nprinciple by requiring that the regulated\n\nobject, before you even get to a \"readily\"\n\nanalysis, has to be clearly identifiable as the\n\nunfinished component part of the regulated\n\nweapon.\n\nSo what that means is you would have\n\nto say this thing is a clearly unfinished\n\ncomponent part of a machine gun, a weapon that\u0027s\n\ndesigned to fire automatically more than one\n\nshot with a single function of the trigger.  But\n\nyou couldn\u0027t say that about an AR-15.  That is\n\nobviously something that\u0027s designed and intended\n\nto be used for semi-automatic fire.\n\nAnd the fact that you might be able to\n\nundertake certain drilling and machining\n\noperations to convert it into a machine gun","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"44","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.

I\n\nthink that that\u0027s a questionable proposition\n\ngiven that if it only takes 20 minutes, the\n\nhobbyist is probably not going to get his\n\nmoney\u0027s worth and won\u0027t actually have the\n\nexperience of building a gun.\n\nBut I also think it\u0027s contradicted by\n\nthe facts on the ground because what the\n\nevidence shows is that these guns were being\n\npurchased and used in crime.  They were sold to\n\nbe crime guns.  There was a 1,000 percent\n\nincrease between 2017 and 2021 in the number of\n\nthese guns that were recovered as part of\n\ncriminal investigations.\n\nAnd it makes perfect sense because the\n\nwhole reason why you would want to get your\n\nhands on one of these unserialized, untraceable\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"76","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.

If you are missing a single hole, then\n\nyou can clearly recognize that as an unfinished\n\ncomponent part of a weapon, and it is readily\n\nconvertible to function. And that fits within\n\nthe plain dictionary definition of what a frame\n\nor receiver is understood to be, no different\n\nthan a bicycle missing pedals or a tennis racket\n\nthat is sold unstrung.\n\nWe have a picture of this on page 34\n\nof our brief, what these frames and receivers\n\nlook like, and it\u0027s hard to know what else to\n\ncall them because they look exactly like the\n\nprincipal structural component of a gun.\n\nBut that just raises the follow-on\n\nquestion:  Okay, if it doesn\u0027t have to be\n\nfunctional, exactly what standard should you use\n\nto measure when it is a frame or receiver\n\nregulated by the statute?\n\nAnd there are good reasons why ATF\n\nfocused on whether it can be readily\n\nconvertible.\n\nFirst, that\u0027s most consistent with how\n\nCongress has approached this issue when it has\n\ndefined terms under the federal firearms laws.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n88\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nThat\u0027s the standard that Congress itself uses to\n\nmark the terrain of what products are regulated.\n\nSecond, there is a consistent agency\n\npractice here of applying that \"readily\n\nconverted\" standard.\n\nMy friend, several times, tried to\n\nsuggest that the 50-plus years of agency","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"78","file_name":"Garland, Att\u0027y Gen. v.
