PHILLIPS:  Yeah.  I mean, the\n\npatent statute is -- is fundamentally different,\n\nI think, from this, because the patent statute\n\ndidn\u0027t have a scienter requirement embedded in\n\nthe -- in the text of the statute.\n\nSection 284 says, you know, you can\n\ntreble the -- the district court can in its\n\ndiscretion treble the damages for any --\n\nessentially, for any reason that had been\n\nconstrued by the Court to be narrower than that.\n\nBut, when the Court said that it --\n\nyou had to take into account or you -- you know,\n\nyou couldn\u0027t rely solely on objective\n\ndeterminations, it was because there was\n\nembedded in the history of the patent law bad\n\nfaith. And, therefore, an examination of bad\n\nfaith was required as part of that, or you\n\ncouldn\u0027t limit the district court\u0027s discretion\n\nin deciding how to enhance the damages by\n\nexcluding the bad faith element.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I mean, that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n74\n\nOfficial\n\nmakes Halo sound very patent-specific, and, you\n\nknow, maybe I\u0027m wrong about this, somebody","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"66","file_name":"U.S., ex rel.

the other side\u0027s\n\nconcession that the subjective standard applies\n\nto facts is, I think, quite a helpful one for us\n\nwhen it comes to figuring out what standard you\n\nshould apply to law.  You should do the same one\n\nbecause the statute only has one.\n\nLastly, I just want to push a little\n\nbit on some of the descriptions that Mr.\n\nPhillips is offering of the record in this case.\n\nYou know, he says there\u0027s no guidance, there\u0027s\n\nnothing.  But we have cited the contrary\n\nguidance, and we have, moreover, cited all of\n\nthe internal communications showing that their\n\nemployees understood that guidance.\n\nAs Justice Gorsuch said, these are all\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n86\n\nOfficial\n\nlovely things that he should tell a jury about\n\nwhy they couldn\u0027t have had an idea at the time\n\nthat what they were doing was wrong, but they\n\nare not a basis to hold as a matter of law that\n\nthe defendant\u0027s subjective intent is always\n\nirrelevant if someone can identify an\n\nobjectively reasonable interpretation.\n\nFor those reasons, we would ask the\n\nCourt to reverse the judgments below.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.
