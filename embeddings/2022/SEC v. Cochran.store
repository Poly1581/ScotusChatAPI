So, in the Elgin case,\n\nit was the CRSA\u0027s scheme which established a\n\nsystem for challenging adverse employment\n\nactions or removals.  And in the Thunder Basin\n\ncase, it was a scheme that challenged -- for\n\nchallenging citations and other administrative\n\norders by the Mine Act.\n\nAnd that\u0027s what you had in both of\n\nthose cases.

STEWART: You know, I said at the\n\noutset of this argument that in our view,\n\nreally, the hardest question is whether Cochran\n\nshould lose for jurisdictional reasons or should\n\nlose on some other basis because Standard Oil\n\nmakes so clear that the commencement of an\n\nagency adjudication is not final agency action.\n\nAnd -- and I -- I agree with you that\n\nit would certainly have been a plausible way for\n\nthe Court to proceed to say that if a statute --\n\nif a claim asserts a violation of federal law,\n\nthen, by definition, it arises under federal\n\nlaw, and, therefore, it falls within the\n\njurisdictional grant of 1331.\n\nAnd if you filed your suit in district\n\ncourt, the district court has jurisdiction, and\n\nthere are lots of other potential objections to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\nthe suit going forward, but jurisdiction is not\n\none of them.\n\nThat -- that would have been an\n\nentirely plausible way for the Court to approach\n\nthis from the outset.

Those arguments can\n\nbe and have been waived here.  I think they\u0027re\n\nirreconcilable with Free Enterprise Fund itself,\n\nand they provide no basis for holding that there\n\n-- the district courts lack jurisdiction over\n\nthis important class of claims.\n\nI heard my friend complaining about\n\nthe -- the difficulties of determining whether\n\nor not a claim is a structural constitutional\n\nclaim or drawing the line in the district court.\n\nWe don\u0027t think that that will be difficult at\n\nall. This Court has already talked about and\n\ndiscussed and is familiar with the concept of\n\nstructural constitutional violations.\n\nThat\u0027s a line that -- that can be\n\ndrawn.
