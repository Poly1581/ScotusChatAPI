agent is forbidden to trade that\n\npower for private gain.\n\nA public official is an\n\nagent of the public and, therefore, violates the\n\nbribery laws if he sells his official authority.\n\nThis concept is fundamentally\n\ninapplicable to someone who is not a public\n\nofficial, someone who is not an agent of the\n\npublic and has no official authority to sell.\n\nAt all relevant times, Petitioner here\n\nwas a private citizen.  He took no oath of\n\npublic office.  He received no salary from the\n\npublic fisc.

None of it entrusts\n\nofficial power to exercise on the public\u0027s\n\nbehalf.  And so none of it can be the predicate\n\nfor a bribery conviction.\n\nBy trying to stretch Section 1346 to\n\nprohibit the sale of influence, the government\n\nalso contradicts this Court\u0027s decision in\n\nSkilling, which saved the statute from a due\n\nprocess challenge only by narrowing it to its\n\ncore and excluding novel outlier theories.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Percoco v.

framework and the facts of this case.\n\nWhile functioning as a government\n\nofficial and after he had decided to return to\n\nformal government employment, Petitioner\n\naccepted multiple bribes in

returning to government.\n\nThat was a violation of his duty of honest\n\nservices as this Court has always understood\n\nthat duty.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:

The problem is that\n\noutsiders don\u0027t really have any reason to know\n\nthose things, and an outsider can also be on the\n\nhook under this statute, right, for doing the\n\npaying.\n\nBut your test gives the outsider no\n\nreal notice, does it?\n\nMS. REAVES: No, because the mens rea\n\nrequirement here and the mens rea requirement\n\nthat the jury was instructed on also applied to\n\noutsiders like Aiello, and that required the\n\njury to find that everyone who was convicted\n\nknowingly and willfully participated in the\n\nscheme to defraud with knowledge of its\n\nfraudulent nature, with a specific intent to\n\ndefraud, and that -- and that included specific\n\nintent to deceive for the purpose of depriving\n\nanother of the intangible right of honest\n\nservices.\n\nAnd the jury was also instructed that\n\ngood faith on the part of a defendant was a\n\ncomplete defense.

On 666, they concede it\n\nrequires agency. And there was no agency theory\n\npressed on this count.\n\nAnd then, on 201, the best they can do\n\nis Dixson.  I would just read from Dixson.  I\n\nmean, Dixson said, to be a public official under\n\nSection 201, an individual must possess some\n\ndegree of official responsibility for carrying\n\nout a federal program or policy.\n\nAnd then it said that in that\n\nparticular case, when one examines the structure\n\nof the program and sees that the act vests in\n\nlocal administrators like petitioners the power\n\nto allocate federal fiscal resources and so on,\n\nit\u0027s clear that they are public officials.\n\nI mean, that\u0027s not what we have here.\n\nAnd so, because the government can\u0027t point to\n\nanything in the pre-McNally case law that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n77\n\nOfficial\n\nremotely resembles a consensus, they can\u0027t point\n\nto anything under 666, and their best example\n\nunder 201 doesn\u0027t get them close, I don\u0027t think\n\nthe conviction can withstand scrutiny.\n\nIf there are no further questions,\n\nthank you, Your Honors.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"68","file_name":"Percoco v.
