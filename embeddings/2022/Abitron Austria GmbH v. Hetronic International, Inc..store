a.m.)\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\n\nargument first this morning in Case 21-1043,\n\nAbitron Austria GmbH versus Hetronic\n\nInternational.\n\nMr. Walker.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LUCAS M. WALKER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. WALKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Lanham Act does not apply to\n\nPetitioners\u0027 use of trademarks in foreign\n\ncountries because nothing in the Act provides\n\nthe clear, affirmative, and unmistakable\n\nindication needed to overcome the presumption\n\nagainst extraterritoriality, especially as to\n\nforeign defendants, like Petitioners.\n\nThe text of the statute never says it\n\napplies to uses of trademarks outside the\n\nUnited States.  And it is a foundational\n\nprinciple of both U.S. and international\n\ntrademark law, embodied in multiple treaties,\n\nthat trademark protections are inherently\n\nterritorial and do not extend beyond the borders\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nof the country granting protection.\n\nAny argument that the Act extends --\n\ndeparts from that longstanding principle would\n\nhave to be based on especially compelling\n\nevidence.  But, here, Hetronic International\n\noffers only the text definition of commerce, and\n\nthis Court has repeatedly rejected the notion\n\nthat commerce language is enough to extend the\n\nlaw to foreign conduct, even if that language\n\notherwise invokes the full scope of a\n\nconstitutional commerce power.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Abitron Austria GmbH v.

So I -- I -- I have three\n\nresponses to that.\n\nFirst, I think the regime is\n\nreally about the use of the mark in commerce.\n\nThe use of the mark in commerce is how you\n\nmake -- you register a trademark, it\u0027s how you\n\nmaintain a trademark, it\u0027s how you infringe a\n\ntrademark.  The registered trademark protects\n\nthe exclusive right to use the trademark in\n\ncommerce.\n\nAnd I think the entire backbone of the\n\nstatute focuses on that use, and I also think\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n17\n\nOfficial\n\ncontext is important. And, here, we have the\n\nlongstanding internationally recognized\n\nprinciple that trademark protections are\n\nterritorial in nature and that foreign trademark\n\nprotections don\u0027t apply within the United\n\nStates.  United States trademark protections do\n\nnot apply in foreign countries.\n\nAnd so the way you can administer that\n\nis -- is -- is through looking at a clear test,\n\nthis is -- and this is my third point. Morrison\n\nasks for a clear test to avoid the confusion and\n\nhaziness that you might have when you\u0027re kind of\n\nbalancing factors to figure out whether\n\nsomething applies to foreign conduct.  And I\n\nthink that --\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you, do --\n\ndo you dispute that there\u0027s no trademark\n\nviolation if the use of the mark in commerce\n\ndoesn\u0027t cause customer confusion?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"14","file_name":"Abitron Austria GmbH v.

Sometimes it\n\nwill be effects.  Sometimes it will be one\n\nperson\u0027s conduct.  Sometimes, as Morrison shows,\n\nit will be an entirely different person\u0027s\n\nconduct.\n\nSo, you know, there\u0027s a good deal of\n\nflexibility in this test, and the question is,\n\nwhy in this case, when we stare at the Lanham\n\nAct, isn\u0027t the focus of the statute confusing\n\nuses?\n\nMR.

 That\u0027s correct.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  But, in Steele, it\n\nseems to have been quite relevant.\n\nThe very\n\nfirst sentence of the opinion points out that --\n\nit -- it defines the issue, and it refers to a\n\ncitizen and resident of the United States.\n\nSo you are really asking us to\n\noverrule Steele in part, are you not?\n\nMS.

We think the better reading is that it\u0027s\n\nnot that -- that it\u0027s not a relevant factor, but\n\nthere are -- for instance, Steele also reached\n\nits conclusion as a matter of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.  It thought this was a question\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction.  It\u0027s pellucid\n\nunder this Court\u0027s precedents that\u0027s not\n\ncorrect.  And I don\u0027t think the Court would have\n\nany hesitation in saying, well, that -- that\n\npiece of the reasoning was incorrect.\n\nAnd so we view the citizenship as a\n\nlittle bit of something you can set aside just\n\ngiven -- given the ability to apply the modern\n\nframework and replicate kind of the heart of\n\nSteele in terms of the confusion.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"44","file_name":"Abitron Austria GmbH v.

A court in any member\n\ncountry, including Germany, that is competent to\n\nrule on trademark infringement would assess\n\nwhether there exists a likelihood of confusion\n\non the part of the public.\"\n\nAnd it goes on to say that the test\n\nfor that for -- in these member countries\n\nconcerns use that occurs in the union or in\n\nindividual member countries.  Consumer confusion\n\nincludes acts of targeting customers in the\n\nterritory of the union, but it excludes the mere\n\naccessibility on a website of the territory\n\ncovered by the trademark.\n\nMS.

harm to --\n\nto -- to goodwill.

It requires a domestic\n\nuse of the mark in commerce within the\n\nUnited States.\n\nAnd that ends up reading the \"use in\n\ncommerce\" consistently throughout the entire\n\nstatute because the use in commerce of a mark is\n\nalso required under Section 1 to register a\n\nmark. It\u0027s also required under Section 8 to\n\nmaintain a mark.  The PTO has -- for the entire\n\nexistence of the Act, correctly recognizes that\n\nthat\u0027s a domestic use in commerce.\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t make any sense to allow a\n\nU.S. trademark right to be based on uses of the\n\nmark outside of the United States.

that\u0027s\n\nwhy the statute itself says in Section 2(d) that\n\nwhen the PTO is examining trademark registration\n\napplications, it has to consider resemblance to\n\nother marks previously used in the United\n\nStates.  If it was going to be affording\n\nprotection outside of the United States, you\u0027d\n\nwant the PTO to be examining against uses\n\noutside of the United States.\n\nA couple other textual points to make\n\nvery quickly.

There are no relevant amendments\n\nexcept for two.  Section 7 was amended to say\n\nthat filing the application gives a right that\n\nis -- a right of priority that is nationwide in\n\neffect.  It wouldn\u0027t make any sense for that to\n\nbe a nationwide right of priority if it was\n\npurporting to give rights that apply outside of\n\nthis nation.\n\nCongress also amended the Act to\n\nimplement the Madrid Protocol, and that is all\n\nabout territorial extension of trademark\n\nprotections that exist in one country into the\n\nterritory of another country.  And the way it\n\ndoes that is not by projecting the first\n\ncountry\u0027s laws into the second country\u0027s\n\nterritory by its own force but by obtaining\n\nrights under the domestic law of the second\n\ncountry.
