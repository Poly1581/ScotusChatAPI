Two is the\n\ncontrast between the language that Congress used\n\nthere, \"in aid of,\" and the language that\n\nCongress used in (c)(2)(E), \"in connection\n\nwith,\" which is broader, and \"relates to\" in\n\n(f)(1), which this Court also has said has a\n\nbroadening effect.\n\nThis Court has interpreted similar\n\nlanguage, such as in the Electric Power Supply\n\ncase, where it interpreted \"affecting\" to mean\n\ndirectly affecting, in order to put reasonable\n\nlimits on seemingly broad terms.\n\nAnd, lastly, we\u0027re relying on the fact\n\nthat under our interpretation, there is separate\n\nmeaning to clause (1) and clause (2), whereas\n\nthe government\u0027s interpretation creates massive\n\nsurplusage by rendering all of clause (2) and\n\nmuch of clause (1) meaningless within this\n\nstatute.  Congress was simply wasting its time\n\nin writing those provisions, which is what Judge\n\nKethledge recognized in dissent below.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"4","file_name":"Karcho Polselli v.

They asked the law\n\nfirm directly, not the bank.  The law firm said\n\nwe don\u0027t have any such records, even though they\n\nknew that Mr. Polselli was a longtime client of\n\nthe law firm.\n\nOnly at that point, when they didn\u0027t\n\nhave cooperation of the law firm, did they ask\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\nfor the bank statements.

 Yep.\n\nTheir principal\n\npoint in their briefing was the legal interest\n\ntest, but I actually didn\u0027t hear anything about\n\nthat legal interest test from them today.  I\n\nmean, the legal interest test is adding words to\n\nthe statute, and we know that when Congress\n\nwanted to create a limitation based on the\n\ntaxpayer\u0027s interest in certain records, it did\n\nso expressly.  It did that in the very next\n\nsection of the code, Section 7610.\n\nThe other -- I guess the other -- the\n\nother point I would just make is that I think\n\nthe statutory history, which my friend pointed\n\nto, actually reinforces our reading of the text\n\nbecause Congress passed this provision in\n\nresponse to this Court\u0027s decision in Donaldson.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial\n\nBut Donaldson simply involved liability\n\ninvestigation summonses, and it said that a\n\ntaxpayer who is the subject of a liability\n\ninvestigation summons was not generally entitled\n\nto judicial review of that summons.\n\nCongress wanted to overturn that\n\nresult as to liability investigation summonses,\n\nbut it did not want to disturb the IRS\u0027s ability\n\nto promptly and efficiently collect taxes at the\n\ncollection phase.  And that\u0027s clear from the\n\ntext of the statute because subsections (a) and\n\n(b) are all about liability investigations\n\nsummonses and they provide notice and judicial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"48","file_name":"Karcho Polselli v.
