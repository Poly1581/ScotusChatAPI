Hansen violated that\n\nstatute by inducing noncitizens to reside in the\n\nUnited States illegally so that he could take\n\ntheir money in a fraudulent citizenship scheme.\n\nNo one suggests that

But the Ninth\n\nCircuit invoked the overbreadth doctrine to\n\nfacially invalidate this longstanding statute by\n\ngiving the words \"encourage\" and \"induce\" their\n\nbroadest possible meaning and sweeping in wide\n\nswaths of protected speech.\n\nNow we haven\u0027t argued that the statute\n\nwould be constitutional if it swept that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nbroadly.

To the extent\n\nthe Court has spoken to this issue, it\u0027s done it\n\nin cases like Williams and Pittsburgh Press,\n\nwhere it said that offers to engage in or\n\nattempts to solicit or induce illegal\n\ntransactions, even if they\u0027re only civilly\n\nprohibited, are just outside the protection of\n\nthe First Amendment.  And I think -- so to say\n\nanything beyond that would be new.\n\nI -- I think the things that --\n\nprinciples that might come into play, you know,\n\nI can conceive of, if you had a law that\n\ntargeted just speech that didn\u0027t target\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n27\n\nOfficial\n\nassistive or soliciting conduct, there might be\n\ndifferent issues that would come into play.\n\nThat\u0027s not a concern here because everyone\n\nagrees that this statute gets at encouraging and\n\ninducing, whether that happens through speech or\n\nconduct.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"23","file_name":"United States v.

Now I want to make two further\n\nassumptions, okay?  One -- we can come back to\n\nthose assumptions, but I just want you to assume\n\nthem.\n\nThe first is that the statute, even as\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n41\n\nOfficial\n\ninterpreted by you, would, in fact, encompass\n\nthe wealth of examples of people of various\n\nkinds, friends, neighbors, doctors, whatever,\n\nsaying to people, I really think you should\n\nstay, and saying that knowing that they\u0027re in\n\nthe country unlawfully, having all the intent\n\nthat -- and so the -- my first assumption is\n\nthat all of those communications are within the\n\nstatute.\n\nMy second assumption is that for one\n\nor another reason, maybe it\u0027s what Justice Alito\n\nsaid about the fact that this is civil conduct,\n\nmaybe it\u0027s for another reason, my second\n\nassumption is that this statute as applied to\n\nthose people would -- would be unconstitutional.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"36","file_name":"United States v.

Congress removed\n\nthe narrower verbs, \"solicit\" and \"assist,\" and\n\nleft in the broader verbs, \"encourage\" and\n\n\"induce.\"  That was a deliberate choice.  If\n\nCongress wanted to write a solicitation law, it\n\ncould have left in the verb \"solicit.\"\n\nAnd I note that in 1984, which was two\n\nyears prior to the 1986 amendment to the\n\nstatute, Congress drafted 18 U.S.C. 373, which\n\nis the general prohibition on soliciting a crime\n\nof violence, and Congress took a very different\n\napproach in writing that solicitation statute.\n\nIt required specific intent to solicit a\n\nparticular felony, and it required circumstances\n\nstrongly corroborative of that intent.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"54","file_name":"United States v.

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nFLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nI\u0027d just like to say a word about what\n\nthe statute means, a word about this\n\ncriminal/civil distinction, and then close with\n\na word or two about overbreadth.\n\nSo, first of all, about what the\n\nstatute means.  I understand their position to\n\nbe that until 1952, this was a permissible\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n94\n\nOfficial\n\nstatute because it had other words in it, but in\n\n1952, Congress turned it into a prohibition on\n\nspeech.  And I think that\u0027s a pretty\n\nextraordinary thing for Congress to have done,\n\nand the Court should demand a pretty\n\nextraordinary showing before assuming that\n\nCongress did it, and I just haven\u0027t heard such a\n\nshowing made.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve heard is Congress took out\n\nsome words.  And that\u0027s true, but the words it\n\nleft in had the same meaning and the words it\n\nleft in were the words this Court had just used\n\nto summarize the previous statute.\n\nI heard that it took out the mens rea\n\nrequirement in 1986.  But that\u0027s not quite\n\nright. It tailored the mens rea that the\n\noffender has to know about the noncitizen\u0027s\n\nstatus, knowing or in reckless disregard, but it\n\nleft in the words \"induce\" or \"encourage.\"  And","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"85","file_name":"United States v.

Instead, they\u0027re -- they want\n\na special rule.  They want to say it\u0027s okay to\n\ncivilly regulate that kind of solicitation and\n\nfacilitation, but you can\u0027t criminally punish\n\nit.\n\nAnd that sort of mismatch is just not\n\nsomething that I know of any analog in this\n\nCourt\u0027s First Amendment jurisprudence.

I think it\u0027s just\n\nworth underscoring all of the different ways in\n\nwhich Respondent and the Ninth Circuit are\n\ntrying to stretch overbreadth doctrine.\n\nThis Court has said that limiting\n\ninstructions are especially important in\n\noverbreadth cases, but they ask you to bypass a\n\nlimiting instruction.\n\nThe Court has said that we are in\n\nrealistic danger of prosecution, but they\u0027re\n\nasking you to find the statute overbroad, even\n\nthough we don\u0027t have any history of either\n\nprosecution or of chilling.\n\nAnd the Court said in Hicks that\n\nrarely if ever will a statute be overbroad when\n\nit aims at conduct and not primarily at speech\n\nor at inherently expressive conduct.  But this\n\nis a statute that we know from 70 years aims\n\nprimarily at conduct, even if you thought it\n\nalso may sweep in some speech.\n\nIt would really be extraordinary, I\n\nthink, to say that the statute can\u0027t be used to\n\nprosecute schemes like Mr. Hansen\u0027s and all of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n99\n\nOfficial\n\nthe other schemes that it has been used to\n\nprosecute over the last 70 years.\n\nWe\u0027d ask the Court to reverse.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.
