SCHNAPPER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSection 230(c)(1) distinguishes\n\nbetween claims that seek to hold an internet\n\ncompany liable for content created by someone\n\nelse and claims based on the company\u0027s own\n\nconduct.  That distinction is drawn in each of\n\nthe three sections of the statute.\n\nFirst, Section 230(c)(1) is limited to\n\nclaims that would treat the defendant as a\n\npublisher of third-party content.  The statute\n\nuses \"publish\" in the common law sense.

The\n\nstatutory defense doesn\u0027t apply insofar as a\n\nclaim is based on words written by the defendant\n\nor other content created by the defendant.

The first\n\none is, on a close reading of the amicus briefs,\n\nit\u0027s clear that they are urging the Court to\n\nhold that a wide variety of different kinds of\n\nthings are protected.

Well, I -- I just\n\nthink it\u0027s going to be difficult. How would you\n\nrespond to Justice Gorsuch\u0027s hypothetical about\n\nthe artificial intelligence creating content\n\norganizational decisions?\n\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think the\n\norganizational decisions could still be\n\nsubjected to a suit.  Whether you think of them\n\nas recommendations or simply as the platform --\n\nthe -- the operation of the platform, it\u0027s still\n\nthe platform\u0027s own choice.\n\nAnd if you ask how did a particular\n\nvideo wind up in the queue of a particular\n\nindividual, it -- it could be some -- some sort\n\nof artificial intelligence that was making that\n\nchoice, but it would have to do with the --\n\nYouTube\u0027s administration of its own platform.\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be a choice made by any third-party\n\nwho had posted it because third parties who post\n\non YouTube don\u0027t direct their videos to\n\nparticular recipients.\n\nAnd -- and I -- I do want to emphasize\n\nthis -- this theory, this rationale applies even\n\nin the most mundane circumstances.
