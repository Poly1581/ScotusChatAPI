are two sets of reasons why,\n\none doctrinal, the other practical.\n\nFirst, doctrinally, a Skinner claim\n\nchallenges the law, not a judgment.  So it makes\n\nsense to challenge what the state court of last\n\nresort authoritatively says the law means after\n\nthat construction becomes final on denial of\n\nrehearing.  By analogy, appellate review does\n\nnot proceed until a lower court denies\n\nrehearing, and traditional due process claims\n\naren\u0027t complete until the state\u0027s full\n\nprocedures deny due process.\n\nThe fact is rehearing can change\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nreasoning and results.  And while a Section 1983\n\nprisoner need not exhaust, just as a litigant\n\nneed not seek rehearing, the clock doesn\u0027t start\n\nticking until the state court procedures have\n\ncome to an end.\n\nSecond, as a practical matter, tying\n\naccrual to the end of state court litigation is\n\nsimple, predictable, and sensible. Tying\n\naccrual to some earlier stage is not.  Linking\n\naccrual to the trial court\u0027s judgment would\n\ndisrespect the state court\u0027s appellate process\n\nand require a stay in almost every case.  It\n\nwould clutter dockets with protective\n\ncomplaints, motions, and amended complaints.\n\nAnd it raises more questions than it answers.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit said Reed\u0027s claim","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Reed v.

think the\n\nother -- the other point here is that the Court\n\nhas suggested to prisoners in Osborne and\n\nSkinner that they go pursue the state court\n\nprocedures.  And, of course, that\u0027s exactly what\n\nMr. Reed did in this case.\n\nAnd I think it would put prisoners in\n\na tough position to be expected to pursue the\n\nstate procedures, as Justice Alito was asking\n\nabout, you know, in the interest of federalism\n\nand comity and then say, but we\u0027re going to\n\nstart the clock at some early point.\n\nThe other problem I think with\n\nGoertz\u0027s rule, which I understand to be a notice\n\nrule -- so he\u0027s not looking at the 2014 initial\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\ntrial court denial.  Let me just step back and\n\nsay what happened in 2014. He\u0027s looking at the\n\n2016 denial.\n\nSo what happened in this case was\n\ntrial court initially denied DNA testing in\n\n2014, didn\u0027t make any findings or holdings about\n\nnon-contamination. It went up to the Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals.  The Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nwanted further findings, and one of the things\n\nit wanted a finding on, it wanted several\n\nthings, but one of them was the chain-of-custody\n\nrequirement in which you eventually have the\n\nnon-contamination requirement that lives inside\n\nthe chain-of-custody requirement. Sends it back\n\ndown.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"25","file_name":"Reed v.

I think that\n\nit would be this Court or the federal courts\n\nessentially saying to the state courts we don\u0027t\n\ncare what other mechanisms you have that are\n\navailable, we don\u0027t care how often you may or\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nmay not change your reasoning, because that --\n\nthat could also happen.\n\nSo I think the only distinction the\n\ncourt could draw between the issue -- between\n\nsaying that the -- the cause of action should\n\naccrue at the trial court\u0027s opinion versus the\n\nCCA\u0027s opinion versus denial of rehearing is\n\nsaying, well, we think it\u0027s a lesser chance that\n\nsomething is going to happen.\n\nBut, again, the procedure exists for a\n\nreason.  And just as the colloquy with Justice\n\nSotomayor at the beginning, you wouldn\u0027t\n\nexpect -- I don\u0027t think anyone could come to\n\nthis Court before they received the denial of\n\nrehearing or an amended opinion on rehearing\n\nbefore a federal court of appeals in much the\n\nsame way.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nJustice Thomas?\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Did you file a cert\n\npetition in this before?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"29","file_name":"Reed v.

On jurisdiction, the\n\ndefendant Reed named, the claim he brought, and\n\nthe relief he seeks don\u0027t line up.\n\nReed sued Goertz for a declaration\n\nregarding Chapter 64, but Chapter 64 governs\n\nonly access to testing through Texas courts.  It\n\ndoes not control Goertz\u0027s common law authority\n\nto agree to testing.\n\nA declaration regarding Chapter 64\n\nagainst Goertz would neither affect Goertz\u0027s\n\ncommon law authority nor bind Texas courts.\n\nThat mismatch deprives Reed of standing and\n\nforecloses his reliance on Ex parte Young.\n\nOn the merits, everyone agrees that\n\ndue process is the relevant constitutional\n\nright, and everyone agrees that Wallace supplies\n\nthe presumptive rule.

three points.\n\nJustice Alito and Justice Barrett\n\nasked about I think the exhaustion question and\n\nwhether exhaustion would be required.\n\nI don\u0027t think the Court has to address\n\nthat here.  I don\u0027t think it is required.  I\n\ndon\u0027t think the Court has to address it because,\n\nof course, Mr. Reed, if you look at it this way,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n68\n\nOfficial\n\ndid exhaust all of the available procedures and,\n\ntherefore, Mr. Reed must be correct in this case\n\nif that is a requirement.\n\nBut, if it\u0027s not a requirement, then\n\nwe\u0027re saying by analogy you would look to\n\ntraditional due process claims and they\u0027re all\n\nthe practical reasons, of course, to wait until\n\nthe state court proceedings are over.\n\nThe second point is I didn\u0027t hear any\n\npractical concerns maybe until the end there\n\nabout capital defendants as to why Goertz\u0027s rule\n\nis superior or why it\u0027s more administrable.  I\n\nthink Mr. Reed\u0027s rule is the clearest, most\n\nadministrable, simple rule here.\n\nAnd, finally, as to -- as to the delay\n\nquestion, many defendants are going to be\n\nnon-capital defendants like Osborne, and those\n\npeople are going to be subject to the same\n\nregime.  And nothing is going to happen to them.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"61","file_name":"Reed v.
