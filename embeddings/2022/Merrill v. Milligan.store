You know,\n\nnobody disputes that intent isn\u0027t relevant.  The\n\nquestion is, is intent required? And when I\n\nread your brief, the -- all over it, you suggest\n\nthat intent is required. And I thought that we\n\nhave said on numerous occasions that intent is\n\nnot required, and the reason we\u0027ve said it on\n\nnumerous occasions is because that\u0027s what\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial\n\nCongress said.\n\nWe once long ago said that intent was\n\nrequired in Voting Right -- in the Voting Right\n\n-- Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and\n\nCongress immediately slapped us down and said\n\nno, we didn\u0027t mean that and made clear in the\n\nlanguage of the statute that it was\n\nincorporating a results test, an effects test.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"11","file_name":"Merrill v.

you seem to say what\n\nwas wrong with the other simulations is that\n\nthey took race into account.  And the state\n\nrejected that to look for the -- the neutral\n\nplans.\n\nThat sounds to me like something\n\nthat\u0027s looking for intent. You say there was no\n\nintent because every time we ran the simulation\n\nwithout taking race into account, this is what\n\nit came up with.\n\nAnd my understanding of our -- our\n\ncases is that you don\u0027t have to show intent.

It\u0027s the\n\nthree preconditions and then the rigorous\n\nanalysis of the totality of the circumstances\n\nthat\u0027s critical to making that quintessentially\n\nlegal judgment of when there\u0027s less opportunity.\n\nBut if I could pick up on the idea as\n\nwell of why I think it would be so unworkable in\n\npractice to try to inject this idea of race\n\nneutrality, you know, the whole function of the\n\nfirst Gingles precondition is to require\n\nplaintiffs to show that you can intentionally\n\ncreate a majority-minority district.  And if\n\nthey have to do that without taking any account\n\nof race, then they effectively have to kind of\n\nstumble into the district by accident.\n\nAnd I think that will inevitably lead\n\nto running these kinds of simulations that have\n\nbeen discussed at length this morning that are\n\nincredibly complicated to try to operationalize\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n103\n\nOfficial\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- in practice.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if the\n\nrace-neutral simulations are as bad as you say,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"91","file_name":"Merrill v.

here went through all of them, and it said\n\nthat down the line looking at the traditional\n\ndistricting criteria, these districts, as my\n\nfriend said, performed as well or better than\n\nthe

So to the extent that you think\n\nthat this is a tough question and maybe a\n\ndifferent fact finder could have reached a\n\ndifferent result, I think that\u0027s precisely why\n\nthe Court has recognized that the district\n\ncourt\u0027s decision merits a substantial amount of\n\ndeference in this kind of area.\n\nI\u0027d like to, if I could, try to\n\ncomplete my answer on why I think trying to\n\nincorporate race neutrality into the first\n\nGingles precondition is also unnecessary.  If I\n\nunderstand the state\u0027s argument correctly, the\n\nstate is suggesting that this is the way to\n\nensure that a state is not required to draw an\n\nunconstitutional racial gerrymander on the back\n\nend at the remedial stage.\n\nAnd I think the problem with that\n\nargument is it ignores that there are already, I\n\nwould say, four independent checks in existing\n\ndoctrine that ensure the state will never be put\n\nin that position.\n\nThe first thing is the fact that the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"98","file_name":"Merrill v.
