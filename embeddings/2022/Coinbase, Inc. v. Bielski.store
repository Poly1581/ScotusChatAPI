result follows from the\n\ncenturies-old divestiture rule, as well as by\n\nCongress\u0027s choice to adopt an asymmetric\n\ninterlocutory rule in FAA Section 16(a).\n\nThe parties today agree on a lot,\n\nnotably, that the divestiture rule of Griggs is\n\nthe law.  The filing of a notice of appeal\n\ndivests the district court of its control over\n\nthose aspects of the case involved in the\n\nappeal.\n\nThe only question today is whether\n\ndistrict court proceedings are aspects of the\n\ncase involved in the appeal.

Those choices reflect\n\nCongress\u0027s fear about the interim harm from\n\ncontinued litigation.\n\nIn 1988, Griggs was ensconced as the\n\nlaw, and Congress knew that authorizing these\n\ninterlocutory appeals would authorize the usual\n\nstays too. Indeed, when Congress wants to\n\nprevent a mandatory stay, they say so expressly\n\nwith anti-stay laws.

KATYAL: Justice Kagan, that is\n\nthe very argument on appeal authority, and this\n\nis not a circumstance in which Congress did what\n\nyou\u0027re saying.\n\nSo, if you compare, for example,\n\n16(a), which says nothing at all about a stay,\n\nto, for example, what it said the day before,\n\nwhich is \"neither the application for nor the\n\ngranting of an appeal under this ... [paragraph]\n\nshall stay proceedings,\" when Congress wants to\n\nhave a discretionary district court stay\n\ndetermination, they say so.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"12","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.

Act, and, to be sure, it\u0027s an\n\naffirmative authorization of a stay pending\n\narbitration.  That\u0027s not like a stay pending\n\nappeal.  There\u0027s no background divestiture rule\n\nabout stays pending arbitration.\n\nCongress had to say something about it\n\nbecause it had no background rule that it was\n\nlitigate -- that it was legislating against.\n\nIt\u0027s an entirely different situation.  They had\n\nto mint a rule.\n\nThe only other one that I think my\n\nfriend really relies on is 1292(d)(4)(B), and\n\nthat (d)(4)(B) provision is very different for\n\nreasons our reply brief says.  16(a) was drafted\n\nfrom scratch.  There was nothing there before.\n\n(d)(4) was written on top of the pre-existing\n\n(d)(3), which passed in 1982, and lo and behold,\n\nthat has an anti-stay provision akin to the one\n\nJustice Kagan was suggesting Congress puts in.\n\nHere\u0027s what it says:  \"Neither the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"13","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.

Then, in 1988, they\n\npassed the statute my friend points to and that\n\nJustice Sotomayor asks about, (d)(4).

They had just taken it back\n\nin 1982. And so that\u0027s why you see Congress\n\ndoing what they\u0027re doing there.  And, of course,\n\nwith the 60-day provision, as our reply brief\n\nsays, it makes sense that they would\n\naffirmatively come in and authorize an automatic\n\nstay for something longer than 60 days if they\n\nhad a 60-day provision in it.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. --\n\nMR.

KATYAL: So, Mr. Chief Justice, I\n\nthink because the background rule at the time\n\nwas always that there would be an automatic stay\n\nand the divestiture would apply in circumstances\n\nlike this.\n\nAnd so -- you know, and that\u0027s why you\n\nhave these 11 statutes which my friend can\u0027t\n\nexplain what they\u0027re about. There is no time in\n\nwhich Congress does what you\u0027re saying, which\n\nthey grant an interlocutory appeal and then say,\n\noh, we\u0027re also going to give you this automatic\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n18\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"15","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.

And here -- here\u0027s my conceptual\n\nproblem with your argument.\n\nAt the moment in which you\u0027re taking\n\nthe interlocutory appeal that they authorize\n\nunder Section 16, what you are vindicating is\n\nyour claim that this is subject to arbitration\n\nafter a district court has denied you that\n\nmotion.\n\nWhat I guess I don\u0027t understand is it\n\nseems to me that your argument is asking for an\n\nextension of the stay principle in the following\n\nway.\n\nSo Section 3 tells us that once a\n\ndistrict court decides, yes, yes, you can go to\n\narbitration, then, upon application of a party,\n\nthe district court has to stay the trial\n\nproceedings.\n\nNow, presumably, if a party doesn\u0027t\n\nask, the district court can keep going.  But\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\nyou\u0027re now suggesting that in a situation in\n\nwhich the district court says no, you don\u0027t go\n\nto arbitration, somehow Congress intended for\n\nthat circumstance, the appeal of arbitrability,\n\nto also give rise to an automatic stay, and I\n\nguess I don\u0027t understand that.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"19","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.

So let\u0027s begin, as we must,\n\nwith the text of Section 16 of the FAA.\n\nCongress says nothing in Section 16\n\nabout mandatory stays.  And this Court has held\n\nin the Scripps-Howard case that Congress would\n\nnot, without clearly expressing such a purpose,\n\ndeprive the courts of their customary power to\n\norder stays under review.\n\nSo what if we look beyond Section 16?\n\nAgain, this Court has held under very similar\n\ncircumstances in the Nken case that when\n\nCongress includes particular language in one\n\nsection but excludes it from another section of\n\nthe same Act, that Congress acts intentionally\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n51\n\nOfficial\n\nand purposely with respect to the disparate\n\ninclusion and exclusion.\n\nAnd, here, in this case, we have two\n\nexamples of this inclusion/exclusion dichotomy.\n\nFirst, we have Section 3 of the FAA itself,\n\nwhich includes a mandatory stay, and then we\n\nhave Section 1292(d)(4)(B), which was part of\n\nthe same Act as Section 16.\n\nUnder basic rules of statutory\n\nconstruction then, Section 16 cannot be said to\n\nharbor a hidden automatic stay provision.

Very simple answer.  You don\u0027t have a\n\nstay in any of those cases because you don\u0027t\n\nhave a right to an interlocutory appeal in the\n\nfirst place.  So those cases don\u0027t arise.  And\n\nthose are the forum selection cases he\u0027s citing.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"83","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.
