PETITIONER\n\nMR. MARTINEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nBoth courts below agreed and Goldsmith\n\ndoesn\u0027t dispute that Warhol\u0027s Prince Series can\n\nreasonably be perceived to convey a\n\nfundamentally different meaning or message from\n\nGoldsmith\u0027s photograph.  The question in this\n\ncase is whether that different meaning or\n\nmessage should play a role, any role, in the\n\nfair use analysis.\n\nOur answer is yes. Warhol\u0027s\n\ntransformative meaning puts points on the board\n\nunder Factor 1 of the four-factor balancing\n\ntest. Goldsmith and the Second Circuit say no.\n\nWarhol\u0027s new meaning is categorically irrelevant\n\nand can\u0027t be considered as part of Factor 1 or\n\nany other factor.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nI want to emphasize three points.\n\nFirst, the precedent supports us.  Campbell\n\nunambiguously requires an examination of meaning\n\nor message.  Google reaffirms that test and\n\ncites Warhol\u0027s Soup Cans as a paradigmatic\n\nexample of when it\u0027s satisfied.  Goldsmith\u0027s\n\ntest is at odds with both cases.\n\nSecond, our approach, unlike\n\nGoldsmith\u0027s, maintains a balance between\n\nprotecting artists\u0027 rights to monetize their","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Andy Warhol Found., Inc. v.

So I think you could\n\njust look at the two works and figure out what\n\nyou think as a judge.\n\nBut I think that more likely, in most\n\nof these cases, the way that they\u0027ve been\n\nlitigated for almost 40 years, that the\n\nlitigants would put forward -- in addition to\n\nthe works themselves, put forward evidence.\n\nSometimes it\u0027s evidence from the -- the creator,\n\nboth creators.

MARTINEZ:  Your Honor, I don\u0027t\n\nthink that that\u0027s what Section 1 is getting at,\n\nbut I think Campbell makes that absolutely clear\n\nbecause, if it were the case that you had to\n\nlook at the higher level of generality, in\n\nCampbell, what you would have said is you have a\n\nRoy Orbison song that\u0027s a work of popular music\n\nthat\u0027s commenting on sexual attraction, and you\n\nhave a 2 Live Crew song that\u0027s also a work of\n\npopular music, also commenting on sexual\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n--\n\n29\n\nOfficial\n\nattraction, they would have the same purpose.\n\nBut you didn\u0027t do that.  Instead, you\n\nsaid let\u0027s -- we need to look at the meaning or\n\nmessage, and then you analyzed whether the\n\nsecond work was -- had a different meaning or\n\nmessage because it was commenting on the first.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"25","file_name":"Andy Warhol Found., Inc. v.

So I\u0027ve been\n\ntrying to figure out when you continually say\n\n\"transformational meaning and message\" and\n\nyou\u0027re focusing on meaning and message, it feels\n\nlike it\u0027s doing a lot of work with respect to\n\nyour Factor 1 analysis, and I think -- I think\n\nthat it might be because you\u0027re conflating\n\nmeaning or message with purpose.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve heard you say a couple times\n\nis that the purpose of Warhol in this situation\n\nwas to essentially convey a different meaning or\n\nmessage, that, you know, the original was\n\nconveying Prince in a vulnerable light and so\n\nthe purpose was to convey him in a more iconic\n\nway.\n\nBut the statute -- and I think this is\n\nsomething that Justice Sotomayor has sort of\n\nfocused on and to some extent Justice Thomas\n\nwith his hypothetical.  The statute seems to be\n\nlooking at purpose at a -- in a different way,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"50","file_name":"Andy Warhol Found., Inc. v.

The copier has to explain\n\nwhy it needed and not just wanted to use someone\n\nelse\u0027s expression.\n\nHere, Petitioner has never given any\n\nreason for copying Ms. Goldsmith\u0027s picture to\n\ncommercially license Warhol\u0027s Orange Prince in\n\n2016. Indeed, Warhol got the picture only in\n\n1984 because Ms. Goldsmith was paid and\n\ncredited.\n\nPetitioner responds Warhol is a\n\ncreative genius who imbued other people\u0027s art\n\nwith his own distinctive style.\n\nBut Spielberg did the same for films\n\nand Jimi Hendrix for music.  Those giants still\n\nneeded licenses.  Even Warhol followed the\n\nrules. When he did not take a picture himself,\n\nhe paid the photographer.

We almost don\u0027t need to go any\n\nfurther.\n\nBut, if you\u0027re not commenting on the\n\noriginal, there\u0027s still the -- the possibility\n\nunder -- under Campbell and then certainly under\n\nGoogle that, yes, this is fair use because it\u0027s\n\nthe kind of thing we think of as truly\n\ntransformative.\n\nMS. BLATT: So I would say you should\n\nlook at a holding over a -- a dicta that uses a\n\nnon-statutory word, \"transformative,\" when the\n\nactual word \"transformation\" is in the statute.\n\nThe dicta that they\u0027re relying on is\n\nsaying we think that when you have a parodic\n\npurpose and a parody in the process of shedding\n\nlight, which I\u0027m just quoting your words,\n\nshedding light on the original, you benefit\n\nsociety and create new meaning.\n\nBut why you know and why all that\n\nmatters in this case is they had an affirmative\n\ndefense and they just didn\u0027t give you a good\n\nreason for copying.\n\nAnd why you know that Campbell just\n\ncompletely rules that out is what mattered in\n\nCampbell was exclusively the parodic purpose.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n69\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"62","file_name":"Andy Warhol Found., Inc. v.
