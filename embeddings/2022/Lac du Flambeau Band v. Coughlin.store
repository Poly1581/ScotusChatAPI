In other words, as\n\nthis Court has framed the inquiry, is there any\n\nplausible way to read the provision as omitting\n\ntribes?\n\nPetitioners easily surmount that bar.\n\nThe First Circuit majority\u0027s reliance on the\n\ngeneric phrase \"other domestic government\" to\n\nsweep in tribes and apparently only tribes rests\n\non a syllogistic interpretation of the terms\n\n\"domestic\" and \"government\" in isolation.\n\nEven if \"other domestic government\"\n\ncould reasonably be construed to refer to\n\ntribes, despite their sui generis nature, the\n\nprovision as a whole doesn\u0027t come close to\n\nproviding the perfect confidence that this Court\n\nrequires for abrogation.\n\nIndeed, Congress has long treated\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n6\n\nOfficial\n\ntribes differently than the governmental\n\nentities enumerated in Section 101(27),\n\nincluding under the federal bankruptcy statute\n\npreceding the code.  Congress gave no\n\nindication, let alone an unmistakably clear one,\n\nthat it newly intended to treat the tribes the\n\nsame in the current code.\n\nI welcome the Court -- Court\u0027s\n\nquestions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"3","file_name":"Lac du Flambeau Band v.

it\u0027s illuminating.\n\nThe omission of tribes becomes much\n\neasier to understand in light of the baseline\n\nagainst which Congress was legislating in the\n\n1978 code.\n\nThe pre-code federal bankruptcy\n\nstatute, which had been on the books since 1938,\n\nthat treated tribes differently than the\n\ngovernmental units specified in 101(27). So the\n\ndisparate treatment is nothing new.\n\nAnd let me be very specific.  The\n\nother side points to the fact that under -- in\n\nthe current code, governmental units are\n\nentitled to preferential treatment for certain\n\nclaims, like tax claims.  They say Congress\n\ncouldn\u0027t have meant to leave tribes out of that\n\nbecause tribes also levy taxes.\n\nBut what they don\u0027t acknowledge is the\n\npre-code statute, which is cited on page 20 and\n\nquoted on page 21 of our reply brief.  In the\n\npre-code statute, Congress did exactly that.  It\n\nextended preferential treatment to tax claims to\n\nthe United States, states, and municipalities\n\nbut not Indian tribes.  So fast-forward to 1978.\n\nRather than list out the entities separately,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"11","file_name":"Lac du Flambeau Band v.

But we also think that if you\n\nthought that tribes had characteristics of both,\n\nthey would still be covered by the statute\n\nbecause the phrase is not just \"domestic\n\ngovernments\" but \"foreign or domestic\n\ngovernments.\"\n\nAnd I would point the Court to\n\nSection 102, subsection 5, of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode, which states that in the Bankruptcy Code\n\n\"or\" is not exclusive.  So, when Congress says\n\n\"or,\" as it did in this phrase, it doesn\u0027t mean\n\none or the other but not both. It means either\n\nor both.\n\nAnd so, to the extent that you have a\n\nentity that has both foreign and domestic\n\ncharacteristics, whether it\u0027s a tribe, whether\n\nit\u0027s an intergovernmental organization, it would\n\nstill be covered by the clause.

One is that it would amount to a rule\n\nof adverse possession.  I think Petitioners\u0027\n\nbasic argument is that even if Congress wasn\u0027t\n\nrequired to use the word \"tribe\" at the\n\nbeginning, when it started legislating as to\n\ntribes, once it has been hyper-clear in all\n\nthese statutes using the word \"tribe\" over and\n\nover, its drafting discretion is now constrained\n\ngoing forward.\n\nAnd that\u0027s just not how this Court has\n\ntraditionally thought of clear statement rules.\n\nCongress has to provide a clear statement, but\n\nwhat it\u0027s done in the past doesn\u0027t dictate what\n\ncounts as a clear statement.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Raynor, do you\n\nwant to take a position on the question that I\n\nasked your friend on the other side about, if a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"50","file_name":"Lac du Flambeau Band v.
