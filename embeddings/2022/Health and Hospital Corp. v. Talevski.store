ROBBINS: Oh, I -- well, if -- if\n\nI thought there was text that actually\n\nforeclosed the adoption of common law\n\nprinciples, I would be the first to agree with\n\nyou, Your Honor.\n\nBut I find no such evidence that FNHRA\n\nor 1983 abrogates the common law against which\n\n1983 was enacted.  And when we ask the question\n\nwhat rights are secured by law, I contend that\n\nit is the marriage of these two statutes, 1983,\n\nenacted in 1871 and amended to add laws in \u002774,\n\nand FNHRA, enacted in 1987, and they both bring\n\nthe old soil with them.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nMr. Fisher.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"37","file_name":"Health and Hospital Corp. v.

First, they\n\nfrustrate informed state assessment of Spending\n\nClause programs.  Second, they disrupt state\n\nefforts to administer complex spending programs\n\nusing scarce resources.  And, third, they --\n\nthey prevent states from pursuing policies\n\nvalued more highly than full federal funding.\n\nFundamentally, private enforcement of\n\nfederal spending conditions takes officials off\n\nthe political hook for policy decisions and\n\nleaves voters without any elected officials to\n\nblame. Accordingly, the Court should finish\n\nwhat it started in Gonzaga and hold that federal\n\nspending conditions are not privately\n\nenforceable unless Congress expressly so\n\nprovides.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n43\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Gonzaga\n\nI -- I wouldn\u0027t say went that far because it\n\ndidn\u0027t, but it imposed a pretty high bar in","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"38","file_name":"Health and Hospital Corp. v.

Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nMr. Snyder.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN W. SNYDER\n\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS\n\nCURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY\n\nMR. SNYDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nFor half a century, this Court has\n\nrecognized that Section 1983 means what it says,\n\nproviding an express cause of action that by\n\ndefault applies to rights created by any federal\n\nstatute.\n\nPetitioners provide no sound basis for\n\nrevisiting that precedent.\n\nFirst, they offer no evidence that the\n\nCongress that enacted Section 1983 would have\n\nviewed breach-of-contract suits by third parties\n\nas remotely relevant to the new tort it was\n\ncreating.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"46","file_name":"Health and Hospital Corp. v.

But, for two reasons, we\n\nthink that the -- the remedy that Congress\n\ncreated here is -- is sufficient to displace\n\n1983.\n\nThe first is that it is an extensive\n\nsystem of remedies that include enforcement\n\nmechanisms by the Secretary himself.  So the\n\nstates administer FNHRA in the sense that they\n\nprovide surveyors who go -- go out to each\n\nfacility each year to make sure that the -- the\n\nfacilities are in compliance with FNHRA.\n\nBut there is also an additional\n\nprocess by which the Secretary can impose\n\nsanctions on each facility.  They can impose\n\ncivil penalties of up to $10,000 per day per\n\nviolation.  They can cut off further Medicaid\n\nfunding at the facility.  They can require the\n\ninstallation of new management at the facility.\n\nAnd they can even order the facility to close.\n\nSo we think those administrative\n\nmechanisms by the Secretary are significant.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nhow you -- how administrative remedies that\n\nlessen the burden on the -- on the -- on the\n\nrecipient, the states, certainly could be taken\n\ninto account.\n\nBut, if the requirement is that the\n\nstates know unambiguously what they\u0027re agreeing","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"48","file_name":"Health and Hospital Corp. v.

TUTT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe difference between our position\n\nand the United States\u0027s position in this case is\n\nunbelievably narrow.  The United States agrees\n\nthat this Court should not overrule decades of\n\nprecedent holding that rights secured by\n\nSpending Clause laws are enforceable under\n\nSection 1983.  And the United States agrees that\n\nFNHRA creates two enforceable rights.  And we\n\nare obviously right about those points.\n\nThe only point of departure is that\n\nthe United States believes that Congress showed\n\na clear intention to preclude access to 1983 by\n\nextending FNHRA rights to residents of private\n\nnursing homes, even though they\u0027re not able to\n\nuse 1983 to enforce those rights because 1983\n\nonly permits suits against government actors.\n\nThat gets the statute backwards.\n\nFNHRA\u0027s text and context show that when Congress\n\nenacted the statute in 1987, it wanted to\n\npreserve access to all available remedies for\n\nFNHRA violations to the greatest extent\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"63","file_name":"Health and Hospital Corp. v.
