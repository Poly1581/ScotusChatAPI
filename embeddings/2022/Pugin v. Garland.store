GANNON\n\nON BEHALF OF MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn 1996, Congress made an offense\n\nrelating to obstruction of justice an aggravated\n\nfelony for purposes of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act.  At the time it did so, the\n\nphrase \"obstruction of justice\" was understood\n\nto include crimes that occurred when a\n\nproceeding or investigation was not currently\n\npending.\n\nThe wheels of justice can be\n\nobstructed even before they begin to move.\n\nIndeed, one of the best ways to obstruct an\n\ninvestigation or a proceeding is to ensure that\n\nit never starts in the first place.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Pugin v.

The question that we offered in\n\nour petition was broader and would have included\n\nthat question in the case of Mr. Cordero-Garcia.\n\nWe think -- we have submitted that the\n\nother side in both cases hasn\u0027t preserved any\n\nother arguments, but we don\u0027t think you would\n\nneed to decide that question. If you wanted to\n\nremand and let the courts of appeals apply your\n\ndefinition or your answer to the question that\n\nthere does not need to be a pending proceeding,\n\nthen my friends on the other side would be able\n\nto raise any other arguments that they happen to\n\nhave preserved.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"28","file_name":"Pugin v.

And it seems to me that your\n\nanswer to this question is really not asking\n\nabout the core.  It\u0027s asking, like, what\u0027s the\n\nouter bounds of the offense and what is anything\n\nthat anybody has said is included in the\n\noffense, and then we\u0027re going to include all\n\nthat in our definition of what a generic offense\n\nis.\n\nBut I guess I would think that that\u0027s\n\npretty inconsistent with how we\u0027ve taken the\n\ngeneric offense question to go generally.\n\nMR.

HUTTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn 1996, when Congress chose to put\n\nthe words \"offense relating to obstruction of\n\njustice\" into subsection (43)(S), it was\n\nchoosing a term of art that meant interference\n\nwith a pending proceeding.\n\nJust one year earlier, this Court had\n\nreaffirmed its century-old holding from\n\nPettibone:  obstruction can only arise when\n\njustice is being administered.  And it had\n\nfurther explained that any interference must\n\nhave a close nexus to that pending proceeding.\n\nAn offense that might or might not\n\naffect a proceeding is not obstruction.  No\n\npersuasive authority supports abandoning this\n\nwell-settled, well-bounded definition for\n\nsomething looser, like a purpose to interfere\n\nwith the process of justice.\n\nAnd doing so would be contrary to the\n\nnotice and administrability concerns of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n52\n\nOfficial\n\ncategorical approach itself.  It would leave\n\ncourts, lawyers, and noncitizens to guess\n\nwhether a predicate offense might at some point\n\ninterfere with some possible process of justice\n\nand thus be an aggravated felony.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"45","file_name":"Pugin v.

It turns, Justice Jackson, to your\n\nquestion, on the elements of the generic crime\n\nof obstruction of justice as traditionally\n\nunderstood.\n\nThe government\u0027s argument today would\n\nsweep in convictions for failure to report a\n\ncrime or for simply urging someone to deal with\n\na traffic accident informally rather than\n\ncalling the police, and that is an offense under\n\nthe California statute at issue in\n\nMr. Cordero-Garcia\u0027s case.\n\nHad Congress meant to treat\n\nconvictions like that as aggravated felonies, it\n\nwould not have used the phrase \"obstruction of\n\njustice,\" which, through longstanding usage, has\n\nrequired interference with a pending\n\ninvestigation or proceeding.
