Under that rule, he\n\nsays, to preserve a purely legal issue for\n\nappeal, parties should insist on trying the case\n\nas if the claim was not already foreclosed.\n\nParties should call every witness, introduce\n\nevery document into evidence, and fight over\n\njury instructions, all as if the judge had never\n\nruled on summary judgment at all.\n\nHe claims this is -- that this\n\napproach would avoid retrials in the event of\n\nsuccessful appeals.  But it would never happen.\n\nNo one thinks it is right, and I doubt Mr.\n\nYounger will defend it here today.\n\nAnd if you\u0027ll permit me to go slightly\n\nover time, I\u0027ll just close by saying that the\n\nCourt should reject a rule that would prevent\n\nappellate courts from collect -- correcting\n\nclear legal errors, even when those errors can\n\nbe intelligently reviewed on an undisputed\n\nrecord and when no party is prejudiced by that\n\nreview.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"3","file_name":"Dupree v.

TUTT: Well, Your Honor, we simply\n\nput an issue as purely legal when it can be\n\nresolved with reference only to the undisputed\n\nfacts. That is the -- that is the way that the\n\nCourt framed it in the Ortiz versus Jordan case.\n\nAnd what it means is that when at summary\n\njudgment you make a motion and you say, I don\u0027t\n\ndispute the plaintiff\u0027s account of what\n\nhappened, I -- and the plaintiff doesn\u0027t dispute\n\nany of my facts, and so, given that nothing\u0027s in\n\ndispute, I should be awarded summary judgment.\n\nThen your motion is purely legal.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, but I think\n\ndoesn\u0027t that sort of defy sort of the way things\n\nare done as a matter of practice?

entered summary\n\njudgment against us on this issue.  It puts\n\neverything on the idea that the order wasn\u0027t\n\nactually a grant of summary judgment.  It was\n\nmerely a grant of summary judgment --\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  It was a denial of\n\nsummary judgment.\n\nMR.

The only way\n\nto finally adjudicate a claim or defense at\n\nsummary judgment is to grant summary judgment to\n\nthe moving or to the non-moving party.\n\nWhen a court denies a defendant\u0027s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on an affirmative\n\ndefense, as here, the defendant must raise his\n\ndefense at trial to preserve it. And to\n\npreserve an argument for entry of a judgment\n\ndifferent from the jury\u0027s verdict, a defendant\n\nmust move under Rules 50(a) and (b).\n\nPetitioner\u0027s attempt to avoid this\n\noutcome by distinguishing between evidentiary\n\nsufficiency arguments and questions of law has\n\nno basis in the rules, and it has nothing else\n\ncommending it either.\n\nA clear line for issue preservation","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"30","file_name":"Dupree v.

It was saying, as a\n\nmatter of Maryland law, given the Maryland\n\nregulations, when an IAU is started, the\n\ngrievance procedure must end.
