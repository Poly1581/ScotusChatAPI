Who decides whether regulation\n\nin this area counts for Indian self-government,\n\npromotes Indian self-government, has a\n\nsufficient tether?\n\nI keep hearing you say in response to\n\nmany of my colleagues\u0027 questions that you think\n\nthat regulation related to family affairs does\n\nnot have a sufficient connection to Indian\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\nself-government.  But, in the actual legislative\n\nhistory of this -- of ICWA -- and I\u0027m reading\n\nfrom the Federal Register -- Congress says that\n\n-- it -- it indicates that ICWA reflects its\n\n\"concern about preserving the integrity of\n\nTribes as self-governing sovereign entities and\n\nensuring that Tribes could survive both\n\nculturally and politically.\"  That\u0027s 81","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"43","file_name":"Haaland v.

Let me\n\nask you another question.  You have seemed to be\n\nvery upset about Congress\u0027s exercise of plenary\n\nauthority over Indian affairs.  You say we need\n\nto look at it in a more narrow lens, I guess\n\nconsistent with the sort of general\n\nunderstanding that Congress has limited\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial\n\nauthority.\n\nWhat I\u0027m a little bit confused about\n\nand concerned about is whether it\u0027s really\n\ncorrect that we have to look at it so narrowly,\n\nthat is, the scope of Congress\u0027s authority as it\n\nconcerns Indian affairs, when we have said over\n\nand over again that Congress has plenary and\n\nexclusive authority, and when the history of our\n\nConstitution indicates that the constitutional\n\ndesign was about ensuring, in a way, that the\n\nfederal government had the authority over the\n\ntribal relations, tribal affairs, and not the\n\nstates.\n\nIt seemed to me that baked into the\n\nConstitution\u0027s structure related to this,\n\noutside of just the Indian Commerce Clause","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"45","file_name":"Haaland v.

My\n\ntime is short.\n\nWith respect to commandeering, where\n\nJustice Barrett took you, do you have a case\n\nthat is older than the early 1990s related to\n\nthe commandeering principle?  Is that the first\n\ntime -- I tried to look back to figure out where\n\nanti-commandeering came from as a constitutional\n\nconcept.\n\nAnd I\u0027ll tell you why I\u0027m concerned\n\nabout it, because I think it\u0027s relatively recent\n\nand I\u0027m just trying to understand whether it\n\neven conceivably applies to an area in which we\n\nhave already or long recognized that the federal\n\ngovernment has this sort of plenary authority\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"48","file_name":"Haaland v.

We reserved that in Printz.\n\nMR. STONE: This Court reserved it in\n\nPrintz with some very specific caveats, I agree,\n\nYour Honor.  Specifically, the Court said it\n\nmight, in fact, be permissible, given that --\n\nand as Justice Scalia noted, it was unclear in\n\nthat case -- given that those courts regarding\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n63\n\nOfficial\n\nthe naturalization oaths may well have\n\nvolunteered essentially to that jurisdiction.\n\nAnd then it becomes a case of, if the\n\ncourts are willingly serving for purposes of\n\ndoing this federal thing, that then it\u0027s a much\n\nsmaller intrusion, commandeering or not, for\n\nthem to have an ancillary paperwork burden.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"56","file_name":"Haaland v.

Of those, two of them are\n\npatently unconstitutional on other grounds.  One\n\nis one of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Another\n\nis essentially a law that required a court make\n\na determination on pension eligibility that was\n\nreviewable by an executive branch.  So those\n\ntell us nothing about the Constitution because\n\nthey\u0027re riven with a plain constitutional\n\nviolation.\n\nTwo more essentially have nothing to\n\ndo with states at all, or one more has nothing\n\nto do with states at all, which is the\n\nHomesteading Act of 1862.

that the preference or the\n\ndiscriminatory rule or set-aside always reached\n\nonly -- and this is in Rice -- only members of a\n\nfederally recognized Indian tribe because that\n\nwas the component

as\n\nsignificant that each of the preferences that it\n\notherwise understood operated on or at least\n\nnear an Indian reservation because the political\n\npreference related to self-government and\n\nanalogizes -- analogized to a couple of things\n\nto individuals who sought to serve a municipal\n\ngovernment, to be able to promote the efficient\n\ndelivery of services, to the
