be\n\nvery brief.\n\nOn that very last point, in the\n\nbriefing, we pointed out that the patent damages\n\nstatute is one example of a statute of\n\nlimitations that does, in fact, operate in that\n\nmanner.  It is true that statute -- that patent\n\ninfringement is considered a separate -- a\n\nseparately accruing tort, but so too, by\n\nanalogy, is a veteran\u0027s disability --\n\nservice-connected disability.  Every month that\n\ngoes by that that veteran is service-disabled,\n\nhe or she is entitled to monthly compensation\n\nunder -- under the statute. So every month that\n\ngoes by can be analogized to a separate --\n\nseparately accruing claim.\n\nI want to just circle back to one of\n\nthe questions that Justice Sotomayor asked, and\n\nthat had to do with whether statutes of\n\nlimitations that exist at the agency level can\n\nbe tolled.  And you are absolutely correct, Your\n\nHonor.
