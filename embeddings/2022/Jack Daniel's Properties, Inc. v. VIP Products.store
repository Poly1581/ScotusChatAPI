BLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThis case involves a dog toy that\n\ncopies Jack Daniel\u0027s trademark and trade dress\n\nand associates its whiskey with dog poop.  After\n\na four-day trial, the district court found both\n\ninfringement and dilution.  The Ninth Circuit\n\nerroneously reversed both holdings.\n\nAs to infringement, the Ninth Circuit\n\ndid not disturb the trial court\u0027s finding of\n\nlikelihood of confusion.  It instead reversed by\n\napplying an exception to the Lanham Act that the\n\nSecond Circuit in Rogers versus Grimaldi\n\ninvented for movie titles.\n\nUnder Rogers, an expressive work is\n\nallowed to confuse as long as the use of a mark\n\nis artistically relevant and not explicitly\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nmisleading.

Artistic relevance has nothing to do\n\nwith confusion, and both implicit and explicit\n\nuses can confuse.  Nor does constitutional\n\navoidance justify Rogers.  Rogers doesn\u0027t\n\nplausibly construe any text, and there are no\n\nFirst Amendment issues to avoid.\n\nTrademarks are ancient property rights\n\nthat necessarily restrict speech to protect\n\ninvestment in goodwill and prevent consumer","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Jack Daniel\u0027s Properties, Inc. v.

that a judge, who has hindsight bias\n\nand is highly analytical, is not going to\n\nrepresent the purchasing public.\n\nThe reason we have surveys in the\n\nfirst place is pretty amazing.

its opinion on page 33a of the\n\npetition appendix.  You have to get over Rogers\n\nand then also show likelihood of confusion,\n\nand -- and that\u0027s just plainly inconsistent with\n\nthe way the statute was designed to operate.\n\nThe second point is that Rogers is\n\nsubstantively inconsistent with the Lanham Act.\n\nRogers requires a showing either of a complete\n\nlack of artistic relevance or that the use of\n\nthe trademark is explicitly misleading.  But, of\n\ncourse, as Ms. Blatt explained, you can have\n\nconfusing uses of marks that are implicitly\n\nmisleading.\n\nSo, you know, Rogers currently is\n\noperating to protect a lot of behavior that\n\ncould cause -- it\u0027s actually likely to cause\n\nconfusion to consumers, and the Lanham Act makes\n\nthat kind of trademark use actionable as\n\ninfringement.\n\nAnd then the third point is that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"41","file_name":"Jack Daniel\u0027s Properties, Inc. v.
