SCHIFF: Justice Thomas, mere\n\nadjacency itself cannot justify the agency\u0027s\n\nstatutory jurisdiction for a -- a number of\n\nreasons.\n\nThe text of the statute says --\n\nsetting aside even \"of the United States,\" the\n\ntext says that if it\u0027s not even a water, it\n\ncan\u0027t even be regulated.\n\nAnd the plain meaning of \"water,\" as\n\nelucidated by dictionary definitions and what\n\nhave you, is not -- is streams, creeks, rivers,\n\nwhat have you, not wetlands.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  But doesn\u0027t that,\n\nMr. Schiff, ignore the import of 1344(g)(1),\n\nwhich really specifically says that when we\u0027re\n\ntalking about waters, we\u0027re talking about --\n\nincluding their wetlands, 1344(g)(1) says.\n\nSo, if we\u0027re going to be fair to the\n\ntext of the statute, isn\u0027t there a pretty\n\npowerful indication that wetlands are included,\n\nadjacent wetlands are included?  And then we can\n\ntalk about what the word \"adjacent\" means, but","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"5","file_name":"Sackett v.

scientifically accurate or not, that what\n\nnavigable waters can be is anything that\u0027s\n\nadjacent to what we think of as traditional\n\nnavigable waters.\n\nNo one\u0027s suggesting you can put

It would sink.  You can\u0027t put a\n\nboat of certain sizes or many near the shore\n\nline because they would sink.  There\u0027s not\n\nenough water there to hold them up.\n\nSo I don\u0027t understand how the wetland\n\nhas to be navigable.  It does have to be\n\nadjacent because it\u0027s part of that river.

Whether\n\nthat\u0027s true or not is irrelevant.\n\nCongress defined the term as navigable\n\nwaters and adjacent wetlands.

But\n\nCongress hasn\u0027t done that.  In fact, it\n\nstudiously avoided touching that central\n\ndefinitional provision for the last 50 years.\n\nWith respect, though, Justice\n\nSotomayor, to your point about how -- why do\n\nwetlands have to be navigable, they don\u0027t have\n\nto be navigable.  Certainly, in the normal\n\ndelimitation of any water, you\u0027re always going\n\nto have a point at which navigability, in fact,\n\ntowards the banks of a river, for example, is\n\ngoing to disappear.  But that doesn\u0027t change the\n\nfact that one can plausibly define a river, say,\n\nup to its ordinary high water mark and\n\nunderstand that water-ward of that mark one\n\nmight not have navigability at all points.\n\nAnd I think the same thing is true\n\nwhen it comes to defining the outer scope of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n24\n\nOfficial\n\nwaters with respect to abutting wetlands, that\n\nas one approaches the shore, it may not become\n\nphysically possible to navigate, but one can","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"20","file_name":"Sackett v.

SCHIFF: Well, Justice Sotomayor\n\nand Justice Jackson, I would say with respect to\n\nthe question of immediate adjacency, I think one\n\nreason why Congress didn\u0027t bother is because I\n\ndon\u0027t believe Congress was at all thinking that\n\n404(g) would have any impact upon the scope of\n\nthe Act.\n\nAgain, if Congress intended to want to\n\ndefinitively change the scope of the Act, one\n\nwould think that the most natural move would\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\nOfficial\n\nhave been to amend the definition of \"navigable\n\nwaters.\"\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  But can I -- can I\n\n-- can I just -- I\u0027m sorry.  You suggest that\n\nthe balancing, that the limitation is about the\n\nconcerns with respect to the state\u0027s\n\nadministration, and 1344(g) is precisely where\n\nthey\u0027re talking about what is left to the state\n\nversus the federal government, and in that\n\nstatute, it just uses \"adjacent.\"\n\nSo I -- with respect, that seems to me","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"22","file_name":"Sackett v.

SCHIFF: Well, it\u0027s certainly not\n\ndefinitive.  It\u0027s not a ratification.  And I\n\ndon\u0027t want to go too far, Justice Barrett, in\n\nsaying that it means nothing, because, again,\n\nRiverside Bayview says it -- it does mean\n\nsomething.\n\nBut, again, it would be strange, it\n\nwould be a -- a -- sort of an inversion of\n\nstatutory interpretation to say that this\n\nparenthetical reference in a provision dealing\n\nprincipally with permit transfer authority\n\nsuddenly backfills and dramatically changes the\n\nscope of the central definitional portion of the\n\nAct, again, a portion that is as -- as much at\n\nissue in criminal prosecution as it is in civil\n\nmatters.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"52","file_name":"Sackett v.

We quote\n\nthat portion in our reply brief where the\n\nemphasis is on how -- I believe these are the\n\nwords that were used -- that from Riverside\n\nBayview, it would not be an exaggeration to say\n\nthat one, after wading through a cattail marsh,\n\ncould then swim into Lake St. Clair, that it was\n\na -- a continuous body of water that at some\n\npoint ended.  And the Court, in looking at those\n\nfacts, said that it\u0027s appropriate to defer to\n\nthe Corps and the EPA in saying that the water\n\nends at this point because we can\u0027t otherwise\n\nsay whether it\u0027s reasonable to have it end at an\n\nearlier point.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"53","file_name":"Sackett v.

But, on the other hand, the\n\nSacketts\u0027 wetland is pretty proximate to the\n\ntributary and the lake.

The Corps\n\nof Engineers first defined \"the waters of the\n\nUnited States\" to include adjacent wetlands in\n\n1975. An interim regulation issued in 1975, and\n\nthose regulations said adjacent or contiguous to\n\nand so I think already made clear that we\u0027re not\n\njust limiting to contiguous right here.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Then it spelled it\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n79\n\nOfficial\n\nout only in \u002777.\n\nMR.

SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nThe last point I\u0027d like to make is\n\nwith respect to compensatory mitigation, simply\n\nthat obtaining a permit is a very expensive\n\nprocess. It\u0027s true that the Corps does not\n\ncharge for permits, but the Corps will never\n\ngive a permit unless one provides compensatory\n\nmitigation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"111","file_name":"Sackett v.
