HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nBankruptcy law gives honest but\n\nunfortunate debtors a fresh start by\n\nextinguishing all their debts.  Exceptions are\n\nnarrow, must be clearly expressed, and reflect\n\ndebtors\u0027 intentional wrongs, not someone else\u0027s.\n\n523(a)(2)(A) thus bars dishonest debtors\n\nfrom discharging liabilities incurred on account\n\nof their fraud.  The code does not bar unwitting\n\ndebtors like Petitioner from discharging debts\n\nfor others\u0027 fraud.\n\nThat conclusion follows from the text.\n\nSection 523 specifies when the individual\n\ndebtor, as distinct from others, cannot\n\ndischarge debts.  (a)(2)(A)\u0027s reference to\n\nactual fraud targets the debtor\u0027s misconduct by\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nrequiring fraudulent intent, just as other\n\ntort-based exceptions target the debtor\u0027s fault.\n\nSince Neal versus Clark, even debtors\n\nwho themselves commit constructive fraud can\n\ndischarge those debts because they lack\n\nfraudulent intent.  Congress did not\n\nirrationally bar debtors who committed no fraud\n\nthemselves from discharging debts for others\u0027\n\nfraud.\n\nRespondent and the government argue\n\nthat anyone\u0027s fraud counts so long as the debtor","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Bartenwerfer v.

The exceptions are\n\nconstrued pursuant to federal law.  Field versus\n\nMans also stands for that proposition.

The state law doesn\u0027t govern\n\nbecause this is a federal law question.  On\n\nfederal law, it\u0027s -- \"individual debtor\" is the\n\nkey phrase.  Is that the basics?\n\nMS.

I\n\nthink also reading in vicarious liability as a\n\nmatter of federal law wouldn\u0027t work either.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right, because we\n\nusually see statutes that specifically speak to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n37\n\nOfficial\n\nthat.

There are sort of the\n\nbucket of hypotheticals where you have two\n\ntransactions and we\u0027re talking about the second\n\ntransaction.  There\u0027s fraud in the first\n\ntransaction.  And then, just like in the Justice\n\nThomas hypothetical, we\u0027re now in the second\n\ntransaction that didn\u0027t involve any fraud and\n\nwe\u0027re trying to figure it out.\n\nI think, as my friend mentioned, you\n\nknow, some of this Court\u0027s language, the arising\n\nfrom, doesn\u0027t give a ton of content to what the\n\nactual causal requirement is, but I think we\n\nwould be perfectly comfortable sort of in a\n\nfuture case that actually raised that type of --\n\ntype of hypothetical asking, you know, is this\n\nreally the causation that Congress meant when it\n\ntalked about \"obtain.\"  I think the answer might\n\nwell be no, but, again, that\u0027s not in this case.\n\nThe second bucket of hypotheticals I\n\nthink is when you have sort of the victim of\n\nfraud, and I think, in a lot of those\n\nhypotheticals, state law is going to deal with\n\nthat on the front end because state law isn\u0027t\n\ngoing to hold that person liable.\n\nSo I\u0027m thinking, for example, of, you\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n66\n\nOfficial\n\nknow, somebody who\u0027s defrauded and then, because","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"61","file_name":"Bartenwerfer v.

I think it\u0027s very clear that\n\nwhen Congress was responding to Strang, you\n\nknow, that was in the 1867 statute, the \"fraud\n\nof the bankrupt\" language.  It had already been\n\nrepealed by the time Strang came to this Court.\n\nThe next bankruptcy statute was in\n\n1898, and what Congress did was it kept \"fraud,\"\n\nbut it took out \"of the bankrupt.\"  And so I\n\nthink at least when we\u0027re thinking about this\n\nprovision, it\u0027s very clear that Congress, of\n\ncourse, has never sort of reinserted \"of the\n\nbankrupt.\"\n\nMy friend notes that, you know, it\u0027s\n\nchanged from \"bankrupt\" to \"individual debtor.\"\n\nI\u0027m not sure where that gets her because it also\n\nhasn\u0027t said \"of the individual debtor.\"\n\nSo, yes, I mean, that -- that\u0027s --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n76\n\nOfficial\n\nthat\u0027s a long way -- winded way of saying yes, I\n\nthink that you could certainly limit it to that,\n\nto that understanding.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think Ms.\n\nHarris is right that this was all kind of like\n\nan accident, you -- you know, that you take the\n\nBankruptcy Code as a whole and you say whether","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"71","file_name":"Bartenwerfer v.
