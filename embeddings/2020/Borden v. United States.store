   The most natural reading of that clause is that\n\n14    it reaches only uses of force that are\n\n15    intentionally or knowingly aimed at another\n\n16    person.\n\n17              The force clause, therefore, does not\n\n18    reach a person who uses force recklessly because\n\n19    such a person is indifferent as to whether the\n\n20    force used falls on another person or on no one\n\n21    at all.\n\n22              Such an interpretation not only is\n\n23    compelled by the text of the force clause but is\n\n24    supported by its broader context, namely, to\n\n25    define the phrase \"violent felony\" and to\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n4\n\n1    identify those repeat offenders who are likely\n\n2    to point a gun at someone in the future and thus\n\n3    warrant a minimum of 15 years in prison.\n\n4              Until recently, our interpretation was\n\n5    the uniform interpretation of the courts of\n\n6    appeals, which relied on the text of the force\n\n7    clause and this Court\u0027s decision in Leocal\n\n8    construing it.

             In Begay and then in Sykes, this Court\n\n4    had a very vigorous back and forth on whether\n\n5    the residual clause extended to reckless\n\n6    offenses.  And I think, by the end of Sykes, the\n\n7    Court had effectively restricted the residual\n\n8    clause to intentional offenses.

It\u0027s a\n\n16    distinction that the model penal code itself\n\n17    described as important.\n\n18              And that is simply the distinction\n\n19    between an action that is intended to cause harm\n\n20    and an action that is not intended to cause harm\n\n21    but merely involves the substantial risk of it.\n\n22              And that is the distinction that we\n\n23    think that the language of the force clause\n\n24    captures.\n\n25              But I would make one additional point\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n13\n\n1    that I have not made to date, and that is that\n\n2    even if you think that the \"against\" phrase\n\n3    doesn\u0027t do all of the work, I would submit that\n\n4    this Court\u0027s decisions, and particularly its\n\n5    decision in Begay, do the remainder of the work\n\n6    because they make clear that the relevant\n\n7    language must be understood in its statutory\n\n8    context, which is to provide a definition of the\n\n9    phrase \"violent felony.\"\n\n10              And where someone acts recklessly,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"10","file_name":"Borden v.

And I think it\u0027s important\n\n2    for the Court to keep in mind here that we\u0027re\n\n3    not talking about individual cases.  We\u0027re\n\n4    talking about state statutes.\n\n5              And state statutes ordinarily draw a\n\n6    meaningful distinction between intent and\n\n7    recklessness.  Indeed, the Tennessee statute at\n\n8    issue here separately defines intentional\n\n9    aggravated assault and reckless aggravated\n\n10    assault.  Not surprisingly, Tennessee imposes\n\n11    stricter penalties on the former.\n\n12              And so, you know, to the extent,\n\n13    again, that we\u0027re talking about extreme\n\n14    recklessness, which tends to come up primarily\n\n15    in the context of murder, I think it would be\n\n16    entirely appropriate for the Court either to\n\n17    reserve that question or even to indicate that\n\n18    extreme recklessness is tantamount to intent or\n\n19    knowledge.\n\n20              The second point I would make is,\n\n21    again, looking at state statutes, I really do\n\n22    think that once you start drawing the line\n\n23    between recklessness and negligence, that these\n\n24    are really fine distinctions that involve the\n\n25    degree of risk, the extent of awareness of risk.\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n20\n\n1              And, of course, our fundamental\n\n2    submission to the Court today is that if you\n\n3    agree, as I think one respectfully must, that","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"16","file_name":"Borden v.

You know, it has something to\n\n20    do with defining what the act is, that it\u0027s an\n\n21    act directed at the person of another but is\n\n22    sort of indifferent to what the person\u0027s intent\n\n23    is.

   in Voisine, to the extent that the Court talked\n\n20    about misdemeanor assault, that was simply\n\n21    because that statute covered felonies and\n\n22    misdemeanors.\n\n23              With regard to felony assault itself,\n\n24    the government correctly notes that in a number\n\n25    of states -- it\u0027s around half of them -- there\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage

But, in\n\n2    the majority of those states, there are discrete\n\n3    assault offenses that could be committed\n\n4    intentionally or knowingly.

The \"against domestic\n\n15    relation\" there was used in a sort of colloquial\n\n16    manner, I -- I think certainly not as a\n\n17    technical statutory interpretation.\n\n18              MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I heard\n\n19    my friend on the other side to say that he\n\n20    thinks, when you add \"against,\" the meaning\n\n21    changes because it\u0027s plain that you couldn\u0027t\n\n22    possibly use this language to mean what the\n\n23    majority of courts of appeals have interpreted\n\n24    it to mean since Voisine.\n\n25              And I think this Court\u0027s use of the\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n38\n\n1    phrase in its own language in the opinion in\n\n2    Voisine on page 2282 illustrates that that plain\n\n3    meaning argument that he\u0027s making can\u0027t possibly\n\n4    be right.  It shows the language can be used in\n\n5    this way, and Congress did use the language that\n\n6    way.\n\n7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Recklessness\n\n8    does cover a -- a fairly broad range.

ACCA enhancement but that the crime you\n\n20    committed, all the horribles that you describe,\n\n21    do command a greater sentence.

     But we\u0027re not talking about notice for\n\n10    committing reckless assault under Tennessee law.\n\n11    What we\u0027re talking about is someone who\u0027s been\n\n12    convicted three times for separate offenses\n\n13    under Tennessee law, or other state law, who\n\n14    then, after being convicted of three violent\n\n15    felonies, knowing they shouldn\u0027t possess\n\n16

But\n\n23    Stokeling\u0027s holding reflects that the offense,\n\n24    nevertheless, involves the use of force against\n\n25    the person of another because the defendant\u0027s\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n64\n\n1    force acts against the victim.\n\n2              That\u0027s the way Congress meant the\n\n3    language.

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,\n\n9    counsel.\n\n10              Justice Barrett.\n\n11              JUSTICE BARRETT:  Good morning,\n\n12    Mr. Feigin.  I -- I have a question about the\n\n13    language \"attempted or threatened.\"  So, you\n\n14    know, the statute -- \"to qualify as a crime of\n\n15    violence must have as an element the use,\n\n16    attempted use, or threatened use of physical\n\n17    force,\" suggesting that the kind of use of\n\n18    physical force is the kind that can be attempted\n\n19    or threatened.\n\n20              Does that have any significance here?\n\n21    Do those terms, \"attempted\" and \"threatened,\"\n\n22    make sense when applied to reckless conduct?\n\n23              MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I think,\n\n24    traditionally, under the criminal law, you can\n\n25    have an attempt to commit a crime with\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n65\n\n1    recklessness.  It\u0027s going to -- the elements of\n\n2    the attempt crime and the mens rea for the\n\n3    attempt crime are going to look somewhat\n\n4    different than the crime that actually achieves\n\n5    its completed result.\n\n6              But I don\u0027t see any reason why, and\n\n7    they haven\u0027t really given any reason why, the\n\n8    mens rea for all three of these things has to\n\n9    track one another.  And even if it did,\n\n10    threatening doesn\u0027t actually require intent to\n\n11    use force.

             MR.\n\nFEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I\n\n15    really don\u0027t think so, because we\u0027re just\n\n16    talking about the standard definition of\n\n17    recklessness.  It\u0027s the exact same inquiry that\n\n18    courts are already doing under Voisine and the\n\n19    courts adopting our interpretation appear -- of\n\n20    the ACCA appear to have no difficulty doing.\n\n21              And I\u0027d also emphasize something this\n\n22    Court said at the end of Quarles, which is that\n\n23    at the end of the Quarles opinion, it makes\n\n24    clear that what\u0027s really required under the\n\n25    Taylor categorical approach is some kind of\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n67\n\n1    rough correspondence and that we don\u0027t look at\n\n2    these very minute curlicues of -- of particular\n\n3    state laws.\n\n4              And so I think the combination of all\n\n5    those three things, in particular, the practical\n\n6    evidence that there hasn\u0027t really been any\n\n7    problem with this, shows that -- that there\u0027s\n\n8    really no practical concerns here.\n\n9              JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you, counsel.\n\n10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A minute left,\n\n11    Mr. Feigin.\n\n12              MR.
