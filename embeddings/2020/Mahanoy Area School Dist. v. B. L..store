First, such speech can cause\n\non-campus disruption.  Second, Respondents\u0027\n\napproach would create chaos.  And, third, a\n\nschool nexus requirement and Tinker\u0027s\n\nsubstantial disruption test guard against abuse.\n\nFirst, off-campus speech, particularly\n\non social media, can be disruptive.  The\n\nInternet\u0027s ubiquity, instantaneous and mass\n\ndissemination, and potential permanence make the\n\nspeaker\u0027s location irrelevant.  Yet, the\n\ndecision below arbitrarily treats location as\n\ndispositive.\n\nSecond, Respondents concede schools\n\ncan address off-campus speech, but they propose\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Mahanoy Area School Dist. v.

STEWART: I mean, it\u0027s a little\n\nbit of both. The part that says we oppose\n\nthe school referendum is very similar to the\n\nspeech that was at issue in Pickering, the\n\nseminal case about the rights of public\n\nemployees, and the Court said in that case,\n\nbecause there was no close working relationship\n\nbetween the teacher and the school board, there\n\nwas no likelihood that this would disrupt\n\nworkplace operations.\n\nThe part that says Ms. Jones is a\n\nterrible teacher, that might take it over the\n\nline into school speech.  But a single statement\n\nlike that wouldn\u0027t in our view have the capacity\n\nto disrupt school operations.  If there was a\n\ncontinuing, ongoing, online campaign of virtual\n\nharassment or intense disparaging of Mrs. Jones\n\nor Ms. Jones, that -- that might be a different\n\nsituation.

JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose a student says\n\nsomething outside of school that relates to an\n\nimportant subject, like politics, religion,\n\nmorality, et cetera, et

So an\n\nimportant part of the test that you propose is\n\nwhether the speech intentionally targets\n\nspecific individuals or groups in the school\n\ncommunity.  The verb \"target\" means select as an\n\nobject of attention or attack.

It may matter that the analysis\n\nhere involves -- or the situation here involves\n\na team, not just the school more broadly,\n\nperiod.  Remand.  Is that enough?\n\nMR. STEWART: I -- I think that would\n\nbe enough.  It -- it would probably be helpful\n\nto say, with respect to online speech in\n\nparticular, the location from which the speech\n\nwas posted is ordinarily going to have no\n\nsignificant effect on the likelihood that it\n\nwill cause substantial disruption, but -- but\n\nwe\u0027re -- we -- we entirely agree that the Court\n\nshouldn\u0027t be writing a treatise, and we\n\nparticularly agree that this is not the occasion\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"52","file_name":"Mahanoy Area School Dist. v.

COLE\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. COLE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nAt its core, the First Amendment\n\nprohibits content discrimination.  Its bedrock\n\nprinciple is that a speaker can\u0027t be punished\n\nbecause listeners object to his message.\n\nTinker announced a narrow exception to\n\nthose principles.  It allows school officials to\n\npunish speech based on its content if listeners\n\nobject or might object in a disruptive fashion.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBut it is limited to school-supervised or\n\nschool-sanctioned settings.\n\nThis Court\u0027s school speech cases are\n\ncalled that for a reason.  The authority they\n\nrecognize is justified by and limited to the\n\nspecial characteristics of the school\n\nenvironment.  So schools can prohibit pro-drug\n\nmessages at school but not elsewhere. They can\n\nban profanity at school but not at home. So too\n\nthey can punish disruptive speech at school but\n\nnot at a convenience store on the weekend.\n\nExpanding Tinker would transform a\n\nlimited exception into a 24/7 rule that would\n\nupend the First Amendment\u0027s bedrock principle\n\nand would require students to effectively carry\n\nthe schoolhouse on their backs in terms of\n\nspeech rights everywhere they go.\n\nIt would also directly interfere with","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"57","file_name":"Mahanoy Area School Dist. v.

In quite a few cases, we become\n\na caretaker, and we don\u0027t want to send them home\n\nimmediately because there\u0027s nobody home, and we\n\nhave to plan after-school activities.\n\nThere are dozens of areas that didn\u0027t\n\nused to be thought of as within the purview of\n\nthe public school.  Today, in many places, they\n\nare.\n\nNow add to that the Internet and the\n\nInternet not just listening to teachers but also\n\ndoing homework and also writing papers,\n\nsometimes vaguely defined and sometimes and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n74\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nsometimes.\n\nHow do I get a standard out of that?\n\nI\u0027m frightened to death of writing a standard.\n\nAnd Tinker, after all, doesn\u0027t really write a\n\nstandard.
