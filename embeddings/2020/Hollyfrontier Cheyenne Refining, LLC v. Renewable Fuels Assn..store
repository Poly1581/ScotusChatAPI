KEISLER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe statute establishing the Renewable\n\nFuel Standard exempted all small refineries from\n\nits requirements for the first years of the\n\nprogram and authorizes them individually to seek\n\nextensions of that exemption at any time based\n\non hardship.\n\nThe question here is whether it\n\nprohibits EPA from granting a hardship exemption\n\nto a small refinery that hasn\u0027t been\n\ncontinuously exempt for all prior years.\n\nRespondents claim it does.  Under\n\ntheir view, a small refinery can receive\n\nexemptions indefinitely but only if it\u0027s never\n\nable to comply without hardship.

Respondents\u0027 argument\n\nrests on the word \"extension,\" which they\n\ncontend should be read temporally here to mean\n\nan increase in a length of time.\n\nBut even if \"extension\" is read in its\n\ntemporal sense, that does not require\n\ncontinuity.

It is a word that Congress\n\noften use when it is enlarging or extending the\n\nscope of a preexisting benefit.\n\nAnd we\u0027d, of course, be happy with\n\nthat reading here as well.

For you to\n\nprevail, would your reading have to be the more\n\nnormal reading of \"extension\" or simply one of\n\n-- one possible reading of -- of the word\n\n\"extension\"?\n\nMR. KEISLER: I think I would perhaps\n\nput it in a third way, Justice Thomas, which is\n\nwe think it is the best reading of the word in\n\nthe context of this particular statute, both the\n\nother text, like the words \"at any time,\" and\n\nthe statutory purposes I alluded to anyway --\n\nearlier.\n\nEven if there was some tie-breaker\n\nneeded, we would then say that, as I just\n\nindicated, we think Chevron deference should be\n\naccorded to the earlier 2014 rulemaking.  But we\n\ndon\u0027t rely on that because we think we are\n\nurging the best reading of the statute.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  This seems a little\n\nbit odd to think of an extension for something\n\nthat has already terminated.

My friends say\n\nthat these provisions establish only a limited\n\ntransitional period.  But they\u0027ve identified no\n\nother statute with a transition period remotely\n\nlike what they propose here.\n\nThere\u0027s no defined end date.  There\u0027s\n\nno defined number of years. It instead ends on\n\ndifferent customized dates for each small\n\nrefinery depending on when that refinery first\n\nhappens to be able to comply even if it can do\n\nso only for one year.\n\nThat\u0027s what gives rise to all the\n\nanomalies of similarly situated refineries being\n\ntreated differently.

MICHEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nUnder the key provision in this case,\n\na small refinery may seek an extension of the\n\nexemption under subparagraph (A).  The meaning\n\nof that language is straightforward. If a small\n\nrefinery has an exemption under subparagraph\n\n(A), it can obtain an extension of that\n\nexemption from EPA.\n\nBut, if a small refinery no longer has\n\nthe exemption, it cannot obtain an extension.\n\nEPA cannot grant something that does not exist.\n\nThat is the ordinary, common-sense meaning of\n\nthe statutory text. It gives the word\n\n\"extension\" the same meaning in adjacent\n\ninterconnected clauses, and it reflects the\n\nstatute\u0027s objective to boost production of clean\n\nrenewable fuel while providing transition time\n\nfor small refineries to comply.\n\nAlthough the government endorsed\n\nPetitioners\u0027 alternative readings below, EPA now\n\nagrees that the Tenth Circuit correctly rejected\n\nthem.

MORRISON:  Yes, Justice Kagan.\n\n\"At any time\" speaks only to the simple\n\nprocedural question of when a small refinery can\n\nsubmit its petition.  It says nothing about the\n\nsubstantive requirements for getting an\n\nexemption extended.\n\nCongress added that language \"at any\n\ntime\" simply to clarify that small refineries\n\ncan submit petitions outside of the time-limited\n\nprovisions in (A)(i) and (A)(ii).
