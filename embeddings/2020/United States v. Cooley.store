I -- I\n\nthink, in some sense, we\u0027re having a little bit\n\nof just a terminological debate about what an\n\narrest means.  There may be some things that\n\nwould be colloquially considered an arrest but\n\nnot formally considered an arrest, and we do\n\nthink the tribe can do that.\n\nAs our brief makes clear, we do think\n\nthey can hold a suspect on probable cause for a\n\nreasonable period of time for hand-over, unless\n\nand until state and federal authorities tell the\n\ntribe that they don\u0027t want the person.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, my time is up,\n\nbut I\u0027ll just say it seems to me that under the\n\nFourth Amendment that is an arrest, but thank\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"26","file_name":"United States v.

I have three basic\n\npoints to make today.\n\nFirst, Indian tribes do not have\n\ninherent police power over non-Indians,\n\nespecially on non-tribal lands.\n\nSecond, Congress addressed this issue\n\nby giving the Executive Branch broad authority\n\nto cross-deputize tribal officers to investigate\n\nand police federal crime in Indian country.\n\nFinally, no matter why the tribal\n\nofficer in this case was not cross-deputized,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n33\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthat fact is not a basis to find inherent tribal\n\npolice power over non-Indians.

HENKEL: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nI think we need to start by looking at what this\n\nCourt said about the second Montana exception in\n\nAtkinson Trading Company and Plains Commerce\n\nBank. Those two decisions severely limit the\n\napplication of the second Montana exception.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. I\n\nthink that\u0027s a fair -- fair description, but\n\nthose were, as has been pointed out, regulatory,\n\ncivil, adjudicatory, and you can certainly argue\n\nit makes sense to have a very limited view in --\n\nin that context.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"30","file_name":"United States v.

HENKEL: I don\u0027t think there would\n\nbe any remedy in terms of a private cause of\n\naction for civil damages.  Certainly, tribal\n\nofficers aren\u0027t mentioned in 1983.  You can\u0027t\n\nbring a claim -- claim against a tribe because\n\nthey have sovereign immunity.\n\nYou could potentially try to sue the\n\ntribe in tribal court, but the likelihood of\n\nthat being successful is -- is not very good.\n\nAnd, ultimately, in that -- in that situation,\n\neven if you could sue them in tribal court, you\n\ncan\u0027t get it into state or federal court, so\n\nthis Court doesn\u0027t sit at the end of the line\n\nthere.\n\nSo I think there\u0027s very -- there\u0027s\n\nvirtually no remedy other than exclusion of\n\nevidence in this circumstance.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"48","file_name":"United States v.
