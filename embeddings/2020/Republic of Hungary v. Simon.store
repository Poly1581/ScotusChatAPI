THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. SILBERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nComity-based abstention proceeds from\n\na simple premise that this Court has recognized\n\nsince 1885.  When a complaint alleges that\n\nforeign parties harmed other foreign parties in\n\na foreign country, a federal court can decline\n\njurisdiction in favor of a foreign tribunal.\n\nIn this case, plaintiffs allege that\n\nHungary took property from Hungarians in Hungary\n\nduring World War II. The United States long ago\n\nsettled its claims against Hungary for wartime\n\nproperty confiscations, yet plaintiffs ask an\n\nAmerican court to apply American law and impose\n\neconomy-crushing liability on another sovereign\n\nnation for conduct in the sovereign\u0027s own\n\nterritory that harmed its own nationals more\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthan 75 years ago.\n\nIf the shoe were on the other foot and\n\nthe United States faced analogous claims in a\n\nforeign nation\u0027s court, the comity grounds for\n\ndismissal would be clear and undeniable.

Subject to Final Review\n\nJustice.\n\nI -- I\u0027d like to emphasize two reasons\n\nwhy I think you should be skeptical of the\n\narguments made by my friend on the other side.\n\nFirst, my friend\u0027s position creates\n\nthe anomalous result that it\u0027s easier to sue\n\nforeign sovereigns for conduct in their own\n\nterritory than it is to sue private defendants\n\nfor foreign conduct. And that should be a big\n\nred flag.  If a -- if a case against private\n\ndefendants causes too much international\n\nfriction, that problem only gets worse when\n\nforeign sovereigns are named as defendants.\n\nSecond, my friend never owns up to the\n\nreciprocity implications of her position.  The\n\ntreatment of foreign sovereigns by U.S. courts\n\nsuggests that the United States can be treated\n\nthe same way by foreign courts.\n\nSo, if my friend is right that this\n\ncase must proceed against Hungary, then\n\nanalogous suits against the United States must\n\nalso proceed in foreign nations\u0027 courts.  That\n\nis not what Congress intended.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nMr. Snyder.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN W.

So depending on who is being\n\nsued where, you get a different result when you\n\nask State, is it immediately in our interest or\n\nnot and how is American industry being hurt or\n\nhelped?  Is that something we should take into\n\naccount in comity?\n\nMR.

The\n\nthree Petitioners in the United States have not\n\nidentified any case that wasn\u0027t either a foreign\n\n-- foreign sovereign immunity case or a forum\n\nnon conveniens case.\n\nBut, second, to the extent that the\n\nFSIA displaced any existing common law\n\ndoctrines, they were doctrines that were\n\ndirected to foreign sovereign immunity or things\n\nlike that.\n\nSo my friend, Mr. Silbert, describes\n\nthe comity inquiry as directed to the dignity\n\ninterests of the foreign sovereign.  To the\n\nextent that\u0027s different from a foreign sovereign\n\nimmunity inquiry -- it\u0027s hard to tell how it\u0027s\n\ndifferent -- but it would be -- would have been\n\nsubsumed by the FSIA.\n\nIn -- in contrast, the forum non\n\nconveniens is a generally applicable common law\n\ndoctrine that survives.  And, generally, when a\n\nstatute is enacted, we don\u0027t think that it\n\ndisplaces generally applicable common law\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n53","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"46","file_name":"Republic of Hungary v.

The\n\nConstitution assigns authority over foreign\n\npolicy to the elected branches.  Here, Congress\n\nhas decided that this type of claim -- this is a\n\n-- sorry, this is the type of claim that U.S.\n\ncourts should hear.  And the executive, even\n\nafter being invited multiple times to disagree\n\nwith respect to this specific case, has declined\n\nto do that.\n\nIn these circumstances, a court should\n\nnot be able to step in and disregard its\n\nstatutory jurisdiction based on its own\n\nassessment of foreign policy concerns.  That\n\nscheme would raise serious separation of powers\n\nconcerns and would completely undermine the\n\ncentral purpose of the FSIA, which was to\n\neliminate case-specific foreign policy concerns\n\nfrom questions about when a court should\n\nexercise jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign.\n\nAnd just one final point.

I -- I have three points.\n\nFirst, I -- I did not hear my friend\n\ngive you any real workable limiting principle or\n\nsafety valve for her position, and I think the\n\ncolloquies with Justice Breyer and -- and\n\nJustice Alito brought that out.\n\nThe fact is, if you accept my friend\u0027s\n\ninterpretation of the FSIA, then U.S. courts not\n\nonly can but must hear cases alleging that\n\nforeign sovereigns harmed other foreigners in\n\nforeign countries.\n\nThere\u0027s no doubt that those cases will\n\nbe asserted here and some of them will be highly\n\nproblematic, like the South Africa hypo that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n85\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nJustice Breyer proposed. And I think foreign\n\nnations will be understandably upset if U.S.\n\ncourts adjudicate foreign disputes where foreign\n\ninterests predominate and there is little, if\n\nany, U.S. interest on the other side.\n\nWhen U.S. courts decide cases like\n\nthat, they cause meaningful harm to\n\ninternational relations and they expose the\n\nUnited States to similar litigation in foreign\n\ncourts.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"75","file_name":"Republic of Hungary v.
