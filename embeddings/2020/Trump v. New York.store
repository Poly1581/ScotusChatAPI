prospect\n\nthat the Secretary would never be able to send\n\nthe report to the President, and the President\n\nthen wouldn\u0027t be able to turn around and send a\n\n-- a report to Congress.\n\nSo, no, there\u0027s a live -- you know,\n\nthere\u0027s a live controversy between the parties\n\nin -- in that sense, which is we want to be able\n\nto have the President exercise his power, and\n\nthe

for the Bureau to do,\n\nwhether the President will decide to exclude all\n\nof the subsets that are feasible -- the\n\nmemorandum clearly indicates that the President\n\nhasn\u0027t made that legal judgment; it\u0027s made a\n\npolicy call but not the legal judgment -- and\n\nthe effect on apportionment.\n\nAnd as I said to Justice Kavanaugh, we\n\ndon\u0027t think it matters whether the Court labels\n\nthat under Article III or prudential ripeness,\n\nbut we\u0027re happy for the Court to disagree and go\n\nto the merits because there is a fairly small\n\nwindow of time here for the Court to decide the\n\nmerits.  On the merits, they can\u0027t satisfy\n\neither half of the test.  They\u0027re not residents\n\nand there\u0027s nothing settled about their\n\nresidence.  And they\u0027ve not offered any coherent\n\ntheory of political representation why all\n\nillegal aliens should be included in the\n\napportionment base.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"42","file_name":"Trump v.

That has always included people who\n\nare ineligible to vote, including non-citizens,\n\nand it has also included people who were present\n\nin violation of law.\n\nThe memorandum treats counting people\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nas a reward to be withheld from states that\n\nhouse undocumented immigrants.
