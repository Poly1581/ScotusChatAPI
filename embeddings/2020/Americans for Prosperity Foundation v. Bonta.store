SHAFFER: And let me add just one\n\nother point if I may, Justice Sotomayor.  It\u0027s\n\nimplausible that the State is using Schedule Bs\n\nspecifically in this prophylactic fashion.  They\n\nhave all the other 990 information, including\n\nSchedules L, M, and J that go to interested\n\nparty transactions, in kind donations, and\n\nofficer and employee compensation.\n\nIt is really, I think, not a genuine\n\ninterest that the State is asserting, and, at\n\nbest, it is a negligible one --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"19","file_name":"Americans for Prosperity Foundation v.

SHAFFER: Well, we think the IRS\n\nclearly has a better set of defenses than --\n\nthan California does because of their statutory\n\nmandate, because of the role that Schedule Bs\n\nplay in tax collection specifically and in\n\nindividual donors\u0027 exemptions, because of the\n\nIRS\u0027s nationwide charter that corresponds with\n\nthe nationwide scope of Schedule Bs, and because\n\nyou have a strict confidentiality regime that\n\nexists from the statute on down through careful\n\nprotocols that are implemented on the ground.\n\nAs to the chill, that too is\n\ndifferent.  For the IRS, it\u0027s not a demand by\n\nstate law enforcement, which is what\u0027s at the\n\ncore of NAACP versus Alabama and its progeny.\n\nThe submission to a single federal regulator\n\npursuant to a tight nexus in careful statutory\n\ndesign is much more limited than one state just\n\nasking for this willy-nilly and then other\n\nstates essentially without limitation piling on\n\nby the dozens to the same request.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"28","file_name":"Americans for Prosperity Foundation v.

words really are just asking the\n\nquestion, not answering the question.  You\u0027re --\n\nyou\u0027re asking whether the state has an interest\n\nsufficiently compelling or important to warrant\n\nan exception to a constitutional right or to\n\nspell out the contours of the rights.\n\nAnd two things the Court has often\n\nlooked to in applying that to state laws, say,\n\nin the free speech context and others is, one,\n\nwhether the right -- the exception is\n\nhistorically recognized, that a right has\n\ncoexisted with an exception of some kind\n\nhistorically, and the second thing, this -- the\n\nCourt\u0027s often looked at, not exclusively, but\n\nhas looked at, is how many states have also\n\nshared this same interest.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"61","file_name":"Americans for Prosperity Foundation v.

that\n\nthis right -- this California interest can\u0027t be\n\nall that important, so the argument goes,\n\nbecause 46 other states have not sought this\n\nkind of information?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, let me take\n\neach of those, but I\u0027ll do them in reverse\n\norder.\n\nOn the number of states that regulate\n\nin this way, I don\u0027t think it could possibly be\n\nthe case that California\u0027s law could be invalid\n\njust based on that kind of head count.\n\nObviously, states in our federalist system can\n\nchoose to devote different levels of resources\n\nto problems.  They can choose to regulate in\n\ndifferent ways and have different priorities.\n\nWhat California has shown is that it\u0027s\n\nprioritized this issue of charitable fraud in\n\nthe state, it\u0027s devoted far more resources than\n\nmany other states, and I think it\u0027s done so\n\nbecause of the sheer number of charitable\n\norganizations that solicit in the state and the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n72\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"62","file_name":"Americans for Prosperity Foundation v.

Let me ask\n\nyou about that predictive judgment then.\n\nSo, in -- in pressing for as-applied\n\nchallenges here or talking about whether this\n\nrecord adequately establishes that the\n\nPetitioners have reason or their donors have\n\nreason to fear retaliation, what if the\n\nPetitioners here had filed this challenge right\n\nat the beginning before any of these incidents\n\nof violence had occurred?  How -- how is the\n\nState -- State supposed to judge whether there\u0027s\n\nchilling?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  So the Court\n\naddressed this in Buckley and it said there,\n\nwith respect to minor political parties, that if\n\nthere\u0027s a new political party that doesn\u0027t have,\n\nfor example, a -- a history it can point to,\n\nthen it can rely on evidence with respect to\n\nrelated organizations or organizations that\n\nshare similar missions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"65","file_name":"Americans for Prosperity Foundation v.

FEINBERG: Your Honor, those\n\nconcerns are certainly relevant for\n\nconsideration of an as-applied challenge, but,\n\nin any as-applied challenge, the question is, is\n\nthere a reasonable probability of threats,\n\nharassment, or reprisals, which would turn on,\n\none, the risk that Your Honor noted about those\n\nkinds of harassment but also the risk of public\n\ndisclosure. And, here, with a nonpublic\n\nreporting requirement, those risks of public\n\nthreats would -- there would not be a\n\nsignificant possibility of those.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  So -- but you think\n\nthat there is -- in -- in that calculus, do you\n\ninclude the possibility of an intentional leak\n\nby someone who happens to disagree with or\n\ndislike that particular group, that someone\n\nwould consider that a possibility?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n84","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"72","file_name":"Americans for Prosperity Foundation v.

ALITO:  All right.\n\nThe brief\n\nfiled by the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense\n\nFund says that we should regard your system as a\n\nsystem of de facto public disclosure because\n\nthere have been

This, Your\n\nHonors, when we\u0027re talking about First Amendment\n\nrights, is where facial challenges succeed. And\n\nit succeeded in Stevens, in U.S. v. Stevens,\n\nwithout the Court asking how many groups out\n\nthere would be interested in animal crush videos\n\nand how many would just follow the general\n\nchilling of reproach that was reflected in the\n\nstatute, as opposed to wanting to continue to\n\npublicize those videos.\n\nYou can know, as you sit where you\n\nsit, that, in fact, a substantial number of\n\ncharities and many multiples of their donors are\n\ngoing to have the same interests that these\n\nPetitioners do and suffer the same\n\nconstitutional deprivation absent facial\n\ninvalidation.\n\nAnd that\u0027s the same judgment that the\n\nCourt made in Shelton, making that predictive\n\njudgment, as Justice Barrett put it, as to\n\nteachers, some of whom might have had\n\nassociations with the PTA and -- and other\n\ninnocuous associations, but the Court recognized\n\nthat there would be an inherent chilling effect.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n108\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nWhat we have in our record vividly\n\nillustrates just how pernicious the chill can\n\nbe, just how real the threat to donors is, but\n\nthat\u0027s always been baked into this Court\u0027s\n\nprecedents, and it should remain baked in, and","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"93","file_name":"Americans for Prosperity Foundation v.
