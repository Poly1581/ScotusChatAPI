GEYSER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nRule 39 authorizes district courts to\n\nexercise discretion in denying or reducing\n\ntaxable costs under Rule 39(e), and the Fifth\n\nCircuit\u0027s contrary position ignores the rule\u0027s\n\nplain language, makes nonsense of its structure,\n\ninvites a host of obvious practical problems,\n\nand, if adopted here, would dramatically upset\n\nsettled practice in every single jurisdiction\n\nnationwide, including, ironically, in the Fifth\n\nCircuit itself.  Respondents have now wisely\n\nconceded that Rule 39(e) costs are\n\ndiscretionary.

If you look to page 10 of the\n\nPetition Appendix, this -- the appellate court\n\nin this -- in this case said that Rule 39(e)\n\ncosts are properly sought before the district\n\ncourt.\n\nIt\u0027s totally unclear then how the\n\nappellate court can exercise discretion when the\n\ncost request for those costs under the Fifth\n\nCircuit\u0027s own practice doesn\u0027t even arise at the\n\nappellate level.  They have no idea what those\n\ncosts will be.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd in terms of local rules, the\n\nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\nspecifically say that courts cannot adopt local\n\nrules that trump the provisions of express\n\nrules.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, I -- I\n\n-- I remember it does say that, but I\u0027m not sure\n\nthat that\u0027s followed as strictly as you suggest\n\nto impose -- for something as minor as costs,\n\nwhich is a minor thing in 90 whatever percent of\n\nthe cases, I -- I -- I do think that different\n\ncourts of appeals follow different practices,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"5","file_name":"San Antonio v.

other than\n\nyour case, can you point to any other case\n\nrecently in the Fifth Circuit where this has\n\ncaused a significant problem?\n\nMR. GEYSER: I -- I can quote -- there\n\nis a case, and we cite this in our petition. It\n\nwas a case involving Ericsson, where there was\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nanother massive supersedeas bond, and in that\n\ncase, the district court said it lacked any\n\ndiscretion under the Fifth Circuit\u0027s outlier\n\npractice to deny or reduce a cost award.\n\nBut, again, the real problem here is\n\nthe Fifth Circuit itself says don\u0027t bother us\n\nwith Rule 39(e) costs.  They made that clear\n\nagain in this very case.  They said put in that\n\nrequest in the district court. Yet then they\n\ntell the district court you can\u0027t exercise\n\ndiscretion if some of those costs are improper.\n\nSo it\u0027s -- it\u0027s really a system that\n\ndoesn\u0027t work well but does work well under the\n\nfederal rules and the way every other circuit\n\napplies those federal rules.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBreyer.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"9","file_name":"San Antonio v.

I want to go back to some of the\n\nquestions that Justice Kagan was asking you,\n\nspecifically about 28 U.S.C. 1924.\n\nSo, as, you know, she read the text to\n\nyou and it\u0027s kind of my question too, I mean,\n\nthe district courts have discretion to decide\n\nwhether the costs are correct and necessarily\n\nincurred in the case, is that right?\n\nMR. GEYSER: That is right.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  So why isn\u0027t this\n\njust a dispute about how broad the district\n\ncourt\u0027s discretion is to decide whether a\n\nparticular cost, here, the bond amounts, were\n\nnecessarily incurred?\n\nBecause, as I gather, you\u0027re saying\n\nhere, well, these weren\u0027t necessarily incurred.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nIt wasn\u0027t necessary to get something that was\n\nthis expensive.

I\u0027m wondering --\n\nand, you know, it seems to me like this came up\n\npotentially in your interchange with Justice\n\nKagan -- you said that the supersedeas bond\n\ncosts were -- you -- you treated them as a bit\n\nexceptional because they\u0027d already been approved\n\nby the district court under the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure.\n\nSo I gather that you\u0027re not really\n\ndenying that the district court, through 1924,\n\nhas some authority to reduce when it reviews the\n\nHeritage Reporting

particular\n\ncost has come and gone.\n\nSo you see what I\u0027m saying, that this\n\nis maybe a dispute about supersedeas bonds and\n\nnot more generally about the district court\u0027s\n\nauthority to take into account whether costs are\n\nnecessarily incurred?  Do I understand that\n\ncorrectly?\n\nMR.
