So\n\nthere are going to be many situations where\n\nsomebody seems to be just simply seeking a\n\nmoment of refuge or -- or -- or respite, and I\n\nthink, in those situations, knocking may work.\n\nBut, if knocking doesn\u0027t work all the\n\ntime, as -- as the courts noted more recently,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n8\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nwarrants can be available within five or 10\n\nminutes sometimes and --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"5","file_name":"Lange v.

are felonies.

HARBOURT: Your Honor, it\u0027s not\n\njust the distinction between felonies as a class\n\nand misdemeanors as a class as to the likelihood\n\nthat the offense will involve violence.

But the warrant requirement is\n\nsubject to exceptions, and hot pursuit is one of\n\nthem.\n\nThe hot pursuit exception justifies\n\nwarrantless home entry in a narrow class of\n\ncases where a suspect tries to thwart a lawful\n\npublic arrest by outracing an officer to a\n\ndwelling.\n\nThis Court has never suggested that\n\nthe hot pursuit exception turns on the\n\nclassification of the underlying offense.  It\n\nshould now expressly hold that it does not.

Our principal submission is\n\nthat, for many of the same reasons, the Court\n\nshould recognize at least a general presumptive\n\nrule that when a misdemeanor suspect tries to\n\nthwart a lawful public encounter by moving the\n\nencounter to a residence, an officer\u0027s decision\n\nto follow him is reasonable.\n\nAs the Court recognized in Mitchell\n\nversus Wisconsin, a presumptive rule is\n\nappropriate where the circumstances generally\n\npresent in a category of cases mean that law\n\nenforcement interests will always or nearly\n\nalways outweigh the suspect\u0027s interests.  That\u0027s\n\ntrue here.\n\nOn the one hand, the suspect\u0027s flight\n\nimplicates important societal interests in\n\nenforcing the law and not rewarding flight, it\n\nmakes it difficult for officers to obtain a\n\nwarrant, and it increases the risks of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n91\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ndestruction of evidence perhaps for a more\n\nserious offense, further escape, or danger to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"83","file_name":"Lange v.

One is that officers apply the\n\nExigent Circumstances Doctrine on a daily basis\n\nacross the country in all other circumstances.\n\nAnd the Court has never been confronted with\n\narguments saying that is unworkable or difficult\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n116\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfor officers to do.

And even the Solicitor General\n\ntoday, even through the form of a presumption,\n\nsays that officers should be considering the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.  So it\u0027s the\n\nother side again that\u0027s asking for the officers\n\nto consider something additional, some sort of\n\nhot pursuit special category that would\n\ncomplicate matters.\n\nWe\u0027re asking for the officers to do\n\nexactly what they do all the time.
