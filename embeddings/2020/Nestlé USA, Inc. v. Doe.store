GANNON: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe United States condemns child\n\nslavery and trafficking.  Congress has expressly\n\nprovided for criminal and civil liability for\n\nforced labor in certain circumstances.  And the\n\nfederal government has specifically supported\n\nefforts to eliminate the worst forms of child\n\nlabor at cocoa farms in Cote d\u0027Ivoire.\n\nBut this Court should not extend the\n\nreach of the Alien Tort Statute to encompass\n\nRespondents\u0027 claims in this case for two\n\nprincipal reasons.\n\nFirst, the ATS does not authorize\n\nliability for domestic corporations for the same\n\nreasons that the majority and the plurality in\n\nJesner found that foreign corporations are not\n\nliable.  As the Jesner majority said, a decision\n\nto extend liability from natural persons to\n\ncorporations must be made by Congress rather\n\nthan the judiciary.\n\nAnd, second, the aiding and abetting\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nconduct alleged against defendants does not\n\novercome the bar against extraterritorial\n\napplication of the ATS.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I\n\nwant to ask you the same question I asked Mr.\n\nKatyal.

GANNON: Well, I\u0027m not sure about\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n45\n\nOfficial\n\nother countries, but I do think that one point\n\nis that they are doing that as a matter of\n\ndomestic law and not always with an analogy that\n\nis like the ATS.\n\nAnd, here, the United States Congress\n\nhas actually provided for liability, civil\n\nliability, for many violations of international\n\nlaw.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess the point I\u0027m\n\nmaking here, Mr. Gannon, is -- you know, the\n\nChief Justice started out by saying that other\n\ncountries have not objected here.  And that\u0027s\n\ntrue, but one might make a broader point, that\n\nthe first Congress enacted the ATS in response\n\nto its concerns about other nations being\n\noffended by our failure to remedy international\n\nlaw violations.\n\nAnd one might ask why one would think\n\nthat another country would be less offended by\n\nleaving a foreign victim without a remedy when\n\nthat victim is injured by a U.S. corporation\n\nrather than by a U.S. -- a U.S. individual and,\n\nindeed, that most of the countries around the\n\nworld with which we\u0027re usually associated as a\n\nrule of law nation do not make that distinction.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"39","file_name":"Nestlé USA, Inc. v.

GANNON: One reason is because we\n\ndon\u0027t think that civil liability under the ATS\n\nis the only way that Congress has to ensure that\n\nwe are holding U.S. persons accountable for\n\nviolations of human rights.\n\nUnder the Torture Victim Protection\n\nAct, Congress didn\u0027t think that corporations\n\nneeded to be held liable in order for us to\n\neffectuate our obligations to prevent torture.\n\nAnd, similarly, Congress has provided\n\nfor other remedies besides the TV -- besides the\n\nATS. It has criminal consequences, the types of\n\nthings that Justice Sotomayor was talking about\n\nfor piracy, those were originally\n\ncriminal cases.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Thank you, Mr. Gannon.\n\nThank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nGorsuch.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  I have no questions.\n\nThank you, Chief.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nKavanaugh.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you, Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd good morning, Mr. Gannon.\n\nFootnote 21 in Sosa instructs the\n\ncourts to pay attention or give serious weight\n\nto the executive branch\u0027s view of the case\u0027s\n\nimpact on foreign policy.\n\nIn your view, are you -- does this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"40","file_name":"Nestlé USA, Inc. v.

It\u0027s\n\nabout whether this old statute applies\n\nextraterritorially and who can be sued.\n\nWhen asked by Justices Alito and\n\nSotomayor where in the complaint is there any\n\nknowledge of slavery by the defendants, my\n\nfriend couldn\u0027t answer.  Zilch.\n\nThis case is an easy one on\n\nextraterritoriality where there is no U.S.\n\ninjury and little U.S. conduct.  Accepting the\n\ncomplaint would create the craven watchdog\n\nproblem of Morrison.  Indeed, a breathtaking\n\nkennel of problems, as my friend\u0027s opening line\n\nadmitted that, lawsuits \"without limitation on\n\ndefendants or theories of tort liability.\"\n\nAnd even if aiding and abetting\n\nliability exists, Justice Sotomayor, it doesn\u0027t\n\nget around extraterritoriality.
