ROSS: Certainly, Your Honor.  So\n\nI think that would be a motion to reopen.  And\n\nit\u0027s a little bit complicated, but I think\n\nthere\u0027s essentially three ways that Respondent,\n\nat least before 2020, when there was a slight\n\nchange in the regulations, could have obtained\n\nthat type of relief.\n\nThe first is a motion to reopen asking\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfor equitable tolling because, presumably, at\n\nthat point, the 90-day statutory limit on the\n\nmotion to reopen would have elapsed.\n\nThe second is to ask the government to\n\njoin in a motion to reopen, which would excuse\n\nthe time bar and would not require the\n\ngovernment to actually agree on the merits but\n\nwould be a mechanism of getting the issue in\n\nfront of the immigration judge or the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"11","file_name":"United States v.

the third, and this is the one\n\nthat changed in 2020, is to ask the immigration\n\njudge to rely on his sua sponte authority, and\n\nthat too would make inapplicable the time bar.\n\nNow, in that situation, that\u0027s where the\n\nregulations changed in 2020, but they were\n\nreplaced with a provision that would allow an\n\nindividual to file one untimely motion to reopen\n\nwhen there is a

ROSS: So, Your Honor, again, I\n\nthink that would potentially fall into this\n\nbucket three.  I think it\u0027s probably less likely\n\nthere, honestly, than your prior hypothetical\n\njust because, again, I think that goes to sort\n\nof the substance of what you\u0027re going to get\n\nrather than the procedure available for review.\n\nAnd I think particularly in an\n\ninstance like this, where we know from the\n\nstatute and the regulations that review is, in\n\nfact, available, I would hesitate before\n\nassuming that it would be unavailable in that\n\ncase.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"18","file_name":"United States v.

Yes, Your Honor.\n\nSo I\n\nthink, in this context, substance absolutely\n\nblends with the process, and the reason is that\n\nboth Ross and Mendoza-Lopez talk about\n\nmeaningful access to the procedure at issue and\n\nwhether it can be used for the accomplishment of\n\na purpose.  Simply being able to file a notice\n\nof appeal, especially when there\u0027s BIA precedent\n\nforeclosing the claim, is not meaningful access\n\nto an appeal.\n\nAnd it\u0027s also important to recognize\n\nthat this issue just doesn\u0027t arise under the\n\nPLRA. The -- the claim in Ross, for example,\n\nwas an excessive force claim.  Of course, any\n\nordinary prisoner can develop the facts to\n\ndevelop that type of argument.\n\nHere, it\u0027s an adversary proceeding\n\nagainst a non-citizen in an area where everybody\n\nconcedes that the legal doctrines are mystifying\n\nand opaque.
