our system of\n\ndual sovereignty, only one sovereign can\n\nhave the ultimate authority over land when the\n\nfederal and state governments assert conflicting\n\nclaims.  The Supremacy Clause largely settles\n\nthat debate, and New Jersey concedes that its\n\nsovereignty must yield when the federal\n\ngovernment decides to take state property.\n\nBut, once it concedes that, it has no\n\nimmunity left to assert in the proceedings\n\nnecessary to effectuate the taking.  That\n\nfollows from the immovable property exception,\n\nwhich long predates the framing. No sovereign\n\nhas ever had immunity from the eminent domain\n\nauthority of the superior sovereign over\n\nimmovable property.  It also follows from the\n\nvery nature of eminent domain.  Eminent domain\n\nthat depends on consent is an oxymoron.\n\nSecond, the proceedings here are in\n\nrem and can only augment the state treasury.\n\nThis Court has recognized that in rem\n\nproceedings pose a lesser threat to state\n\nsovereignty.

Thank you, Justice\n\nBreyer.\n\nWhat I would say is all the cases that\n\nare looking for a clear statement are looking\n\nfor it in the abrogation context.  So they\n\nassume that there is a sovereign immunity that\n\nhas to be abrogated.\n\nAnd we don\u0027t think there is any\n\nsovereign immunity here that needs to be\n\nabrogated at all, and I think that\u0027s true for\n\ntwo -- two primary reasons.\n\nOne is because no sovereign has ever\n\nhad a sovereign immunity defense to an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n13\n\neminent-domain proceeding by the superior\n\nsovereign, ever, in the history of the world.

KNEEDLER\n\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS\n\nCURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. KNEEDLER:  I\u0027m sorry.  Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nUnder the Natural Gas Act and this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in City of Tacoma, the courts\n\nbelow were without jurisdiction to resolve\n\nRespondents\u0027 statutory challenge to PennEast\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nexercise of the right of eminent domain.  By\n\ncontrast, the courts below were not precluded\n\nfrom resolving the state\u0027s contention that the\n\nEleventh Amendment bars PennEast\u0027s condemnation\n\nactions, but there is no such Eleventh Amendment\n\nbar.\n\nThis Court held in Kohl that the\n\nfederal government\u0027s power of eminent domain is\n\ncomplete in itself and that no state can\n\nprescribe the manner in which it may be\n\nexercised.

I don\u0027t think that sort\n\nof double speculation is enough to justify\n\neliminating the State\u0027s sort of historic\n\nimmunity to private suit without evidence of\n\nfounding era consent.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I --\n\nI\u0027m not suggesting that it\u0027s enough to eliminate\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"51","file_name":"Penneast Pipeline Co. v.

In some respects, it seems\n\npretty hard to dispute that the state is named\n\nas a party, and under Rule 71.1, the complaint\n\nhad to file suit against both property and at\n\nleast one of the property owners.  And, of\n\ncourse, there\u0027s going to be compensation due to\n\nthe state.  That would seem to be more in\n\npersonam than -- than in rem.\n\nBut there\u0027s also a long strand of\n\nthinking about condemnation proceedings as in\n\nrem, as the notes to the rule make clear.

FEIGENBAUM:  So below before the\n\nThird Circuit -- and you can find this, I think,\n\nmost clearly at pages 20 to 22 of our reply\n\nbrief -- we articulated a theory in which the\n\nUnited States might have an implied power under\n\nthe structure of the NGA to itself step in\n\nessentially on the theory like the Third Circuit\n\nsuggested, that it\u0027s strange to think of FERC\n\nbeing able to grant private parties the ability\n\nto file these suits and not retain that power\n\nitself.\n\nSince that time, the United States\n\nitself has come in at PennEast\u0027s urging to say\n\nwe actually don\u0027t have that authority.  They\n\nobviously say it in the gray brief, but they\n\nsaid it in the declaratory order as well.
