But it didn\u0027t resolve any liability\n\nwith respect to a response action.\n\nAnd, in fact, you know, once this\n\naction was taken to cap the dump, the United\n\nStates in theory could come back and sue under\n\nCERCLA the next day and say, well, you know\n\nwhat, we thought about it some more, we think\n\nyou should tear up and remove the waste\n\naltogether.\n\nThis settlement didn\u0027t resolve any\n\nliability.  And, again, that\u0027s atypical because,\n\nif you look at the model consent decree, it\n\nincludes a covenant not to sue, except for\n\nfuture unknown conditions.\n\nBut the settlement here left Guam\n\nexposed to liability under any law with respect\n\nto any claim involving a response action.\n\nAnd so, for that reason alone, we\n\nwould urge you to rule for us on the second\n\nquestion presented.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"10","file_name":"Guam v.

agreements often can\n\ndisclaim liability but resolve liability at the\n\nsame time.

with.\n\nIn addition, CERCLA often uses the\n\nterm \"response action\" to include acts taken\n\nunder other statutes.  If Congress wanted to\n\nlimit this provision to CERCLA liability, it\n\ncould easily have said so.\n\nThere are many other provisions of the\n\nAct that use terms such as \"settlement under\n\nthis Act,\" \"liability under this Act,\" or\n\n\"response action under this Act.\"  There\u0027s no\n\nsuch limiting language in the provision at issue\n\nhere.\n\nTurning to the second question, the\n\nsettlement here resolved Guam\u0027s liability.

the\n\nliability must be in (f)(3)(B).\n\n(f)(2), however, is simply silent\n\nabout the nature of the liability.  It contains\n\na gap, and, therefore, it\u0027s justified to look at\n\nthe context to fill the gap.\n\nThe second point is that it\u0027s almost\n\n-- there\u0027s an absurdity argument rather than a\n\ntextual argument in (f)(2) because it seems\n\nunthinkable that \"resolved its liability\" means\n\nany liability whatsoever under the sun.

It might be\n\nadministratively easier, therefore, to focus the\n\ncontribution inquiry on that rather than the\n\nsection under which it arose.\n\nAnd the final reason is that (f)(1)\n\nwas written by the House Energy and Commerce\n\nCommittee and (f)(3)(B) was written by the House\n\nJudiciary Committee.

SURI: Justice Gorsuch, the\n\npremise that our petition had that preemptive\n\neffect is incorrect, and there are two\n\nprovisions of the statute that show that it\u0027s\n\nincorrect.\n\nThe first is the last sentence of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n51\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n(f)(1), and the second is the last sentence of\n\n(f)(3)(C).  So the last sentence of (f)(1) says\n\nnothing in this section -- that\u0027s the whole\n\nsubsection, not just (f)(1) -- shall diminish\n\nthe right of any person to bring an action for\n\ncontribution.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Oh, no, sure, I -- I","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"47","file_name":"Guam v.

We argued in our brief that (f)(2) had\n\nto be interpreted to mean resolve CERCLA\n\nliability.  The government was silent on that in\n\nits brief, and with respect, I\u0027m not sure it\n\nshould be able to introduce new arguments at\n\noral argument.\n\nHaving said that, its position is\n\ntelling.  It\u0027s asking this Court now to copy and\n\npaste words from (f)(B) -- (f)(3)(B) into\n\n(f)(2), which only makes the problem worse.\n\nThe key term is \"resolved its\n\nliability.\"  Is it CERCLA liability, or is it\n\nliability under any other law?

If\n\nyou want to go there, as we say on page 30 of\n\nour brief, the legislative history makes clear\n\nthat Congress had in mind CERCLA liability.\n\nSecondly, the consent decree\n\nexplicitly reserves the United States\u0027 right to\n\nbring any claim under any law, including a\n\nCERCLA claim.
