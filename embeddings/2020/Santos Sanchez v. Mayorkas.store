That is because Section\n\n1254a(f)(4) considers TPS recipients to be in\n\nlawful status as a non-immigrant for purposes of\n\nadjusting status, and having been admitted is\n\ninherent in non-immigrant status.\n\nThe government\u0027s view that admission\n\nis not inherent in non-immigrant status is\n\nuntenable.

But, number\n\ntwo, as -- as the government explained to the\n\nBoard in the Garnica Silva case, that language\n\nsimply refers to the possibility that someone\n\ncould obtain U visa status by changing to that\n\nstatus after already having been admitted into a\n\ndifferent status.\n\nAnd it was important for Congress to\n\nuse those words here because this provision sets\n\nforth special procedures for U visa immigrants\n\nto adjust status, and so Congress needed to make\n\nclear that whether they receive that by being\n\nadmitted into that status or whether they\n\nreceive that status by changing into that\n\nstatus, they would be eligible for these special\n\nprocedures.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Would you agree that\n\nif Congress did in (f)(4) what you say it did,\n\nit went about it in a very roundabout way?  It\n\nspecifically addressed two of the requirements\n\nfor eligibility for adjustment of status,\n\nnamely, being in and maintaining lawful status\n\nas a non-immigrant, but it didn\u0027t say anything\n\nabout inspection or admission.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n16\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nWhy would it do that?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"13","file_name":"Santos Sanchez v.

So I\n\nhave a question about 1254a(h).\n\nSo it seems to me that that provision\n\ncuts strongly against your position because that\n\nprovision requires Senate super-majority support\n\nto approve any legislation that provides for\n\nadjustment to lawful, temporary, or permanent\n\nresident alien status for any alien receiving\n\nTPS.\n\nSo, if Congress tied -- or the Senate,\n\nyou know, in -- in the bill that Congress\n\npassed, has tied its own hands in that way, it\n\nwould seem unusual that in the same breath, by\n\nusing non-immigrant status, Congress intended to\n\ndelegate to the executive much broader authority\n\nto treat TPS -- those in TPS status as eligible\n\nfor LPR status based only on the word\n\n\"non-immigrant.\"\n\nCould you address that?\n\nMS. SAHARIA: Sure.  So both parties","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"22","file_name":"Santos Sanchez v.

Subsection (h) only\n\ntells us that Congress wanted to make it more\n\ndifficult for a subsequent Congress to establish\n\na new standalone mechanism for TPS recipients to\n\nadjust status.\n\nAnd that makes sense because Congress\n\nhad done that in the past where it would take\n\nbroad categories of people and make them\n\nautomatically eligible to adjust status.\n\nAnd so Congress, yes, did tie its\n\nhands with respect to creating a new mechanism.\n\nBut Section (f)(4) doesn\u0027t create a new\n\nmechanism.  It just gives otherwise eligible TPS\n\nrecipients access to the existing mechanism in\n\nSection 1255.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  The government\u0027s\n\ninterpretation does give (f)(4) work to do\n\nbecause, you know, those who were in lawful\n\nstatus before, for example, if they overstayed\n\nstudent visas but then became eligible for TPS\n\nstatus, you know, that overstaying is forgiven\n\nif there was a gap, or, similarly, if they got\n\nTPS status while in lawful non-immigrant status","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"23","file_name":"Santos Sanchez v.

look\n\nthrough the United States, look everywhere,\n\neverywhere, every tunnel, every mountain, every\n\nlake, every human being you come across who is\n\nnot, et cetera, if they are non-immigrants and\n\nthey are here lawfully, they are here as\n\nnon-immigrants, they will have been either\n\ndeemed to be or actually been lawfully admitted.\n\nSo it goes along with the game.  There\n\nwe are.  But I admit there are two exceptions.\n\nOne is crewmen, where they use both terms, and\n\nthat could just be overinsurance because they\n\nwanted those people admitted, and the other is\n\nthe U visa.  And the U visa, they could have\n\nbeen trying to do uncertainty.  Okay?  So\n\ndoesn\u0027t that lead -- are there other examples\n\nthat I\u0027ve missed?

HUSTON: Justice Breyer, I --\n\nthere -- I don\u0027t think there are any other\n\nclasses of non-immigrants who are not admitted,\n\nbut the -- importantly, one of the key reasons\n\nfor that is that in that there are certain kinds\n\nof non-immigrants who receive that status within\n\nthe United States after an unlawful entry, and\n\nthose people, of course, would not meet the\n\nstatutory definition of admitted in the ordinary\n\ncase, but, in some cases, Congress has\n\nnevertheless labeled those classes of\n\nnon-immigrants as admitted.\n\nAnd, of course, Congress is free by\n\ncontext to change the meaning of admitted, and\n\nit\u0027s done that a couple of times.  And as you\n\nnote, I think the U visa example shows this too,\n\nCongress has sometimes treated -- Congress has\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n38\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nspecified that U non-immigrants are eligible to\n\nadjust their status whether they were admitted\n\nor otherwise acquired that status.\n\nSo we think that it is not necessary\n\nfor the Court to reach -- to get into Chevron\n\ndeference here because we simply think we have\n\nthe better interpretation of the statutory text.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"33","file_name":"Santos Sanchez v.

No.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJustice Sotomayor, I mean, I disagree with that.\n\nI think the other thing to note about this\n\nargument, of course, is that it\u0027s outside the\n\nscope of the question presented because it only\n\napplies to people who travel abroad.  And the\n\nquestion presented in this case was about the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n45\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\neffect of granting TPS itself.\n\nBut, again, I think the clear import\n\nof MTINA is to specify that a person goes out\n\nand comes back in the same status.  And what\n\nthat\u0027s going to mean for a person like\n\nPetitioners is that they will return to the\n\nUnited States in the status of someone who has\n\nno lawful immigration status, who is present\n\nhere unlawfully and is subject to removal but,\n\nbecause of TPS, will not be removed temporarily\n\nduring conditions in their home country.

We\u0027re not\n\nbacking away from that position.\n\nBut we do think that the Court doesn\u0027t\n\nneed to reach that, and we think the Court\u0027s\n\nprecedents have -- have indicated that the Court\n\nwon\u0027t foreclose the agency in a case like this\n\nfrom considering whether any other alternative\n\nis possible.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.
