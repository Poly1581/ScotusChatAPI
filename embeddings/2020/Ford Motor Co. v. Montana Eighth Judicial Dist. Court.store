MAROTTA: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nSpecific jurisdiction requires that\n\nthe defendant have engaged in suit-related\n\nconduct in the forum state or that it has\n\nengaged in conduct relevant to the plaintiff\u0027s\n\nclaims in the forum state.  If those\n\nrequirements mean anything, it is that the\n\ndefendant\u0027s forum state conduct must be at least\n\na but-for cause of the plaintiff\u0027s claim.\n\nConduct that does not cause a claim\n\nis, by definition, irrelevant to the plaintiff\u0027s\n\nclaim. The claims would be the same with or\n\nwithout the conduct.  And once the court accepts\n\nbut-for causation as the minimum, proximate\n\ncausation follows.

And, of course, you know, Montana\n\nand Minnesota have particular judges, have\n\nparticular juries, have particular evidentiary\n\nrules. There may be some cases where Ford would\n\notherwise waive an available personal\n\njurisdiction defense, but that\u0027s an option\n\nthat\u0027s up to Ford and to the defendant.\n\nAnd the fact that Ford may, you know,\n\nlitigate in these forums anyway, you know, think\n\nof the smaller manufacturers who sell minimal\n\namounts of products in the forum who may have\n\nnever litigated a product case there before.\n\nThe rule you announce today is going\n\nto apply to those manufacturers too and should,\n\nI think, be equal, if not greater, in your\n\nconsideration.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If we -- if we\n\nlook at -- there have been a lot of questions\n\nabout our precedent, but the -- the sentence\n\nfrom World-Wide Volkswagen, and you\u0027re familiar\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nwith the sentence on 297 and 298 of World-Wide\n\nVolkswagen, I guess it ends at the bottom of\n\n297, if we follow that sentence, you lose,\n\ncorrect?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"27","file_name":"Ford Motor Co. v.

ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA ON\n\nBEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\nMR.\n\nGUPTA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThis Court has never read the Due\n\nProcess Clause to deprive the

deliberately\n\ncultivated the market for that product in that\n\nstate.\n\nOver the objection of 40 state\n\nattorneys general, Ford asks this Court to\n\nextinguish the state\u0027s traditional authority\n\neven in this paradigmatic scenario based on an\n\nelusive proximate cause standard.  And I think\n\nwe just heard how elusive it is.\n\nJurisdictional rules should be simple.\n\nThe Ford standard would introduce tremendous\n\nuncertainty and generate needless litigation.\n\nIt would break up garden-variety accident cases.\n\nIt would leave innocent local\n\nbusinesses holding the bag for foreign\n\ncompanies, as the Home Builders and Main Street\n\nbusiness briefs explain.

I think World-Wide Volkswagen had\n\nprecisely this kind of situation in mind.\n\nThe reason they did is because\n\nVolkswagen and Audi hadn\u0027t raised a\n\njurisdictional objection, but there were four\n\nAudi dealerships in the state in Oklahoma in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n63\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1980 and they were selling these cars.\n\nAnd my friend below -- in the courts\n\nbelow referred to that passage as a description\n\nof -- of what would have happened if Audi or\n\nVolkswagen had raised this jurisdictional\n\nobjection.
