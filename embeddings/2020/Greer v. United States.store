GUAGLIARDO:  Your Honor, I -- I --\n\nI think, respectfully, I would -- because the\n\ngovernment does have the burden of establishing\n\nguilt at a trial, I think the -- the rule that\n\nwe\u0027re proposing or -- or asking the Court to\n\nconsider still does two things.\n\nIt requires the government to prove\n\nits case at trial, and it -- it -- it -- and by\n\nasking an appellate court to look at what\n\nhappened at the trial, we\u0027re at least not\n\nrisking what\u0027s going beyond what the court had\n\nsanctioned before by having an appellate court\n\nin the first instance look at information,\n\nevidence, that was never introduced at trial and\n\nimagine a hypothetical trial and affirm the\n\ndefendant\u0027s guilt based on that.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nGorsuch.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n24\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, good\n\nmorning.  I -- I\u0027d like to understand your Sixth\n\nAmendment argument just a little bit better.\n\nAnd the government argues that it\n\nproves too much because courts of appeals, when\n\nconducting a prejudice analysis of trial --\n\nwithin the trial court record, would, on your\n\naccount, usurp the jury\u0027s fact-finding function.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"21","file_name":"Greer v.

ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN W.\n\nSNYDER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR.\n\nSNYDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nEveryone agrees that Petitioner must\n\nsatisfy all four requirements of the plain-error\n\nstandard in order to obtain discretionary relief\n\non his forfeited claims.  The only question in\n\ndispute here is whether the court of appeals was\n\nrequired to completely ignore some of the\n\nevidence in the record in determining whether\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nPetitioner has made those necessary showings.\n\nThis Court has never constrained\n\nplain-error review in that way, and it should\n\nnot start here.  Plain-error doctrine is\n\nintensely practical, asking about substantive\n\noutcomes and fundamental fairness.  The Court\n\nhas always analyzed those questions in light of\n\nall the evidence available to it.\n\nIndeed, the Court has even looked to\n\nevidence from outside the record.  In Neder, for\n\nexample, the Court emphasized that on appeal the\n\ndefendant hadn\u0027t pointed to any new evidence he\n\nmight introduce if he got a new trial.  And in\n\nRosales-Mireles, the Court looked to a\n\ncompilation of psychology research in answering\n\nhow the error at issue there would affect public\n\nperceptions of the proceedings.\n\nPetitioner has identified no\n\nprincipled reason why a court could consider\n\nthose sources but must ignore the undisputed\n\nevidence in the record about his own convictions\n\nand prison time.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"31","file_name":"Greer v.

So the Seventh Circuit, in considering\n\nthis question, drew a line between, you know,\n\ntrial record evidence or all the evidence in the\n\nrecord, evidence as -- as a way -- as a proxy\n\nfor what\u0027s reliable, so things like the P --\n\nPSR, for example.\n\nWhat would be wrong with that? I\n\nmean, that would exclude things like Justice\n\nAlito\u0027s book, but especially in these cases, the\n\nPSR is going to list the felonies, it\u0027s going to\n\nlist the dates of the felonies, it\u0027s going to\n\nlist the length of the sentences.  Why does the\n\ngovernment want more than that, especially in\n\nthese cases?\n\nMR. SNYDER: We\u0027re not asking for more\n\nthan that, Your Honor.  We think that a rule\n\nadopting that line would be sufficient to decide\n\nthis case.  There may be other cases in which\n\nyou have things that aren\u0027t at issue here, so I\n\n-- I mentioned the possibility of taking\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\njudicial notice of the state court documents","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"56","file_name":"Greer v.

The first is that Petitioner\u0027s rule is\n\nunnecessary for any defendant who has a\n\nplausible argument about why a\n\nknowledge-of-status instruction might actually\n\nhave mattered at his trial.\n\nOur rule would allow courts to\n\nevaluate -- evaluate all of the available\n\nevidence and grant case-specific relief whenever\n\nit would be genuinely unfair to hold a defendant\n\nto his forfeiture.\n\nPetitioner\u0027s rule, by contrast, would\n\ngrant a windfall to defendants, like Petitioner\n\nhimself, who cannot reasonably claim to have\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n63\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nbeen unaware of their felon status.\n\nAnd the second, related point is that\n\nPetitioner has really provided no reason at all\n\nfor requiring courts to ignore evidence in the\n\nrecord at the final step of plain-error review.\n\nPetitioner is asking the court to grant him\n\ndiscretionary relief from his forfeiture, and he\n\nbears the burden of showing that it would be\n\nfundamentally unfair not to do so.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"58","file_name":"Greer v.

of that uniform precedent,\n\nthe defendant\u0027s knowledge of status, his mental\n\nstate required to be guilty of this offense, was\n\nnever addressed in the district court\n\nproceedings,

In\n\nOlano, the Court recognized that plain-error\n\nrelief is not limited to those for whom the\n\nappellate court presumes or finds may be\n\ninnocent.  It\u0027s not a guilt-or-innocence\n\ndetermination on plain error.

And the\n\nappellate process undertaken here does not\n\nensure the defendant has act -- his guilt has\n\nbeen established by the government at his trial.\n\nIt does not answer that question.\n\nAnd so, therefore, it\u0027s unfair for an\n\nappellate court to look outside of what was\n\nintroduced against the defendant at his trial to\n\nmake some appellate determination in the first\n\ninstance about whether the defendant may or may\n\nlikely be guilty.
