SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case presents an important\n\nquestion concerning the interpretation of\n\nagreements that delegate questions of\n\narbitrability to the arbitrator.\n\nIn its decision on remand, the court\n\nof appeals recognized that the arbitration\n\nagreements here contained a valid delegation,\n\nbut it held that because the agreements also\n\ncontained a carveout provision, they divided up\n\nresponsibility for arbitrability between the\n\narbitrator and the court.\n\nThe court of appeals proceeded to\n\ndecide the arbitrability question for itself,\n\nthus effectively negating the delegation\n\naltogether.

To do so, the\n\nCourt need only apply two settled principles.\n\nFirst, a delegation is simply an antecedent\n\nagreement that is subject to the rules governing\n\narbitration agreements more generally.  Second,\n\nany doubts concerning the scope of arbitration\n\nagreements are resolved in favor of arbitration.\n\nAnd under that presumption, a carveout\n\nprovision that does not speak to who should\n\ndecide questions of arbitrability cannot\n\nrestrict the parties\u0027 delegation of those","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Harry Schein, Inc. v.

In that circumstance, someone\n\nwould still have to decide whether the action\n\nis, in fact, an action seeking injunctive\n\nrelief. Someone would have to decide where\n\nthere is a dispute over whether the arbitrator\n\nor the court should decide arbitrability.\n\nAnd, again, the court of appeals\u0027\n\ndecision well illustrates the problem because,\n\nhaving held that the parties divided up\n\nresponsibility, the court of appeals proceeded\n\nto decide the question of who decides for itself\n\nand thus effectively negated the delegation\n\naltogether.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Could you just give\n\nme -- help me with the delegation language in\n\nthis contract, this arbitration agreement.\n\nWhere is it?

I\u0027m happy to address the merits of it\n\ndirectly.\n\nThe question is whether the\n\nincorporation of arbitration rules that\n\nauthorize the arbitrator to resolve questions of\n\narbitrability constitutes a valid delegation.\n\nHere, the incorporation is the reference to the\n\narbitration rules of the American Arbitration\n\nAssociation.  That\u0027s quite common in agreements\n\nbetween sophisticated commercial parties like\n\nthe parties here.  And among the relevant rules\n\nis Rule 7A, which authorizes the arbitrator to\n\nmake that determination.\n\nAnd this Court has never required\n\nmagic words on the face of the agreement.\n\nInstead, all that the Court has said is that you\n\nhave to have clear and unmistakable evidence.\n\nAnd under ordinary objective\n\nprinciples of contract formation, the\n\nincorporation of a document suffices in order to\n\nrender that document part of the contract.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBreyer.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  The experience of\n\narbitration in the labor area for this question,\n\nI assume that George Burton\u0027s brief makes a big\n\nargument about the AAA, and -- but I won\u0027t\n\naccept that for purposes of this question.\n\nAssume there is clear and unmistakable\n\nevidence of delegating the arbitration matter to\n\nthe arbitrator in general, okay?

And as I acknowledged earlier, I\n\nthink that there is, you know, some tension\n\nbetween the principle that applies according to\n\nits terms and the presumption in favor of\n\narbitration.\n\nMy point, Justice Gorsuch, is simply\n\nthat all that the Court needs to do in this case\n\nis to apply the presumption in favor of\n\narbitration to the delegation to rule in our\n\nfavor. And what the Court shouldn\u0027t do is what\n\nRespondent suggests, which is to extend the\n\nFirst Options presumption beyond the context of\n\nwhether or not there is a delegation to the\n\nscope of the delegation.\n\nThe latter is a question of contract\n\ninterpretation, and it should be governed by\n\nwhatever the general rules are that govern the\n\ninterpretation of arbitration agreements.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nKavanaugh.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you, Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n27\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nGood morning, Mr. Shanmugam.

And then, in considering the\n\neffect of a carveout, I guess that would apply,\n\nas -- as I understand it, to every arbitration\n\ncontract or virtually every arbitration contract\n\nbecause every arbitration contract specifies\n\neither limits or has carveouts.\n\nAnd so, if that alone means the Court\n\ndecides what is arbitrable, then the Court will\n\nalways decide arbitrability and really eradicate\n\nthe idea that arbitrators can ever decide\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n--\n\n29\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\narbitrability.
