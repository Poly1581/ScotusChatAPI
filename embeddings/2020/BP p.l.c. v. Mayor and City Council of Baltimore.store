SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case presents a question of\n\nstatutory interpretation involving the provision\n\nauthorizing appellate review of certain remand\n\norders.  The relevant provision of\n\nSection 1447(d) authorizes appellate review of a\n\nremand order where a ground for removal was the\n\nfederal officer or civil rights removal statute.\n\nBy its plain terms, the statute\n\npermits review of the entire order, not\n\nparticular issues.  The court of appeals\u0027\n\ncontrary interpretation is invalid.\n\nRespondent offers virtually no textual\n\ndefense of that interpretation, relying instead\n\non case law, policy, and an alternative\n\ninterpretation.

the statutory text and, in any event, lack\n\nmerit.\n\nAs to case law, this Court and the\n\ncourts of appeals have consistently interpreted\n\nstatutes permitting appellate review of an order\n\nto authorize plenary review, and Respondent\u0027s\n\ntwo contrary examples involve unique\n\nconsiderations.\n\nAs to policy, the plain text\n\ninterpretation is consistent with Congress\u0027s\n\nspecial solicitude for cases involving civil\n\nrights and federal officers.  That\n\ninterpretation accords with the background\n\nprinciple of plenary review, would lead, at\n\nmost, to marginal additional delay, and could\n\nactually expedite resolution of the appeal.\n\nAnd as to Respondent\u0027s alternative\n\ninterpretation, a defendant removes a case\n\npursuant to the federal officer removal statute\n\nwhen it invokes the statute in its notice of\n\nremoval, regardless of the merits of that\n\nground.\n\nThe sole remaining question is how\n\nbest to dispose of this case.

 I don\u0027t think so,\n\nJustice Barrett, because that issue really goes\n\nto the appropriate disposition in this Court,\n\nwhether the Court should simply vacate and\n\nremand or reverse outright.  And that issue is\n\nfully briefed here.  And we believe that the\n\nanswer is clear under this Court\u0027s long-standing\n\nprecedents.\n\nAnd there\u0027s also, I think, a very\n\nsignificant prudential reason for the Court to\n\nreach that issue because, as you are aware,\n\nthere are some 20 of these cases pending\n\nnationwide in courts around the country, and,\n\nindeed, there are a number of cert petitions in\n\nfollow-on cases that are currently pending\n\nbefore this Court.\n\nAnd I think, in light of all of those\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n23\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nconsiderations, it would be appropriate for the\n\nCourt to resolve that question.

There is\n\nsimply no natural way to read the phrase \"an\n\norder remanding a case\" as part of an order\n\nremanding a case.  Therefore, once Section\n\n1447(d) authorizes an appeal of a remand order,\n\nthere\u0027s no basis for artificially limiting the\n\nscope of that appeal to a particular question.\n\nRespondent resists that\n\nstraightforward reading but never denies that\n\nits approach would give the phrase \"an order\n\nremanding a case\" different meanings in two\n\nback-to-back clauses of the same sentence.\n\nInstead, Respondent pivots to a novel textual\n\ntheory in its merits brief based on the phrase\n\n\"removed pursuant to.\"","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"22","file_name":"BP p.l.c. v.
