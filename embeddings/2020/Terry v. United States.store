to dispute that modification,\n\namicus argues that the phrase \"statutory\n\npenalties\" means the sentencing range.\n\nBut\n\nSection 2 did not modify any sentencing ranges\n\nat all.  It merely raised the crack quantities,\n\nand Congress knew that.\n\nHistory confirms that (b)(1)(C)\n\noffenses are covered.  Shortly after enactment\n\nof Section 2, Congress approved the Sentencing\n\nCommission\u0027s decision to incorporate Section 2\n\ninto the guidelines for all crack offenders,\n\nincluding (b)(1)(C) offenders.  And in the eight\n\nyears leading up to Section 404, the Commission\n\nrepeatedly used the phrase \"statutory penalties\"\n\nto refer to the higher crack quantities, not\n\nlower sentencing ranges.\n\nFinally, amicus\u0027s contrary\n\ninterpretation would make little sense.  It\n\nwould cover kilogram-trafficking kingpins but\n\nexclude the lowest-level dealers.  He has failed\n\nto offer any coherent explanation for why\n\nCongress would have done that.\n\nAfter all, Congress did not enact\n\nbipartisan criminal justice reform to create new\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n6\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nanomalies. It enacted Section 404 to purge the\n\ntaint of the discredited 100-to-1 disparity.  To\n\ndo that, it gave all crack offenders sentenced\n\nunder that old regime an opportunity to seek a\n\nreduced sentence under Section 2\u0027s new statutory\n\nbenchmarks.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"3","file_name":"Terry v.

the\n\nexact same statute and just substituted the word\n\n\"amended\" for \"modified,\" and it gets exactly to\n\nwhere amicus says that Congress wanted to go.\n\nSo, of course, Congress might have\n\ndrafted this in an entirely different way,\n\nbut -- but, based on the statute we have and the\n\ntwo competing interpretations that are in front\n\nof the Court, our interpretation is textually\n\nsound when you read the phrase \"statutory\n\npenalties\" in context, and that\u0027s the\n\nfundamental flaw with amicus\u0027s theory.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And your in\n\nHeritage

the Petitioner\u0027s opening brief cast\n\nthis scheme as floors and ceilings, kind of\n\nsuggesting that anything that was below, in the\n\nold scheme, 5 grams, which was the limit in (B),\n\nwas necessarily funneled into (C).\n\nAnd you pointed out that wasn\u0027t\n\ncorrect, am I right?\n\nMR. FEIGIN: That\u0027s right, Your Honor,\n\nalthough if, by ceiling -- what we thought was\n\nnot correct was the use of the term \"ceiling\" to\n\nimply that the defendant is actually innocent of\n\na (C) violation if it\u0027s more than a certain\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n52\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nquantity.\n\nIf you use \"ceiling\" a little bit more\n\nloosely to simply mean a cap on the exclusive\n\nrange, then that\u0027s essentially what we\u0027re\n\nsaying, and it\u0027s a fine term to use.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Because am I right\n\nthat one objection you had to that\n\ncharacterization is that those that were\n\nsentenced under (C) weren\u0027t necessarily those\n\nwho had less than 5 grams, but it could have\n\nbeen someone who had 200 grams but was just\n\ncharged under (C) instead?\n\nMR.

people are seeing with\n\nrespect to your interpretation, and that is that\n\ndefendants under (A) and (B) get a new\n\nsentencing and, indeed, their -- their time --\n\ntheir sentence can be reduced to time served.\n\nBut, under (C), the least culpable offenders,\n\nthose people can\u0027t.\n\nNow -- now I understand if what\n\nCongress -- if you\u0027re right about what Congress\n\nsaid, that\u0027s what they said, but why would\n\nCongress want that -- want to implement that\n\nresult?\n\nMR.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nSo let\u0027s talk about the text.\n\nThere\n\nare several additional problems with amicus\u0027s\n\ntextual interpretation that haven\u0027t been brought\n\nup today.\n\nFirst, he\u0027s effectively requiring this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n81\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nCourt to insert the word \"effectively\" before\n\nthe word \"modified.\" Because Section 2 didn\u0027t\n\nchange the ranges, that -- he\u0027s asking the Court\n\nto say that it effectively modified the ranges,\n\nand that\u0027s just not part of the statute.\n\nSecond, his interpretation is\n\ninconsistent with the past tense \"were\n\nmodified.\"  His argument depends on defining the\n\nviolation as a pre-Section 2 50- and 5-gram\n\noffense, but no statutory penalties for those\n\noffenses were modified by Section 2 because the\n\nFair Sentencing Act applied only prospectively.\n\nSo his -- his interpretation is inconsistent\n\nwith the past tense.\n\nFinally, something that occurred to\n\nme, his interpretation would categorically\n\nexclude all pre-Apprendi offenders because none\n\nof them had 5 or 50 grams as an element of their\n\noffense when they were convicted, and there have\n\nbeen 2- to 300 pre-Apprendi offenders who have\n\nobtained relief under Section 404, and they\n\nwould have all been excluded under amicus\u0027s\n\nview.\n\nFinally, amicus referred several

Review\n\ninterpretation of the language would sort of do\n\nviolence to the English language.  Well, I\u0027d\n\nrefer the Court to Justice Scalia\u0027s dissent in\n\nDorsey, and he repeatedly used the phrase\n\n\"statutory penalties\" to refer to something\n\nother than a sentencing range, just as the\n\nCommission did for the eight years leading up to\n\nSection 404. And I think Justice Scalia had a\n\npretty good grasp of the English language.\n\nSecond, on the history, amicus really\n\ndid not say anything at all about the Sentencing\n\nCommission.  And all we\u0027re saying here is that\n\nSection 404, like all other statutes, must be\n\ninterpreted in light of the historical context\n\nin which it was enacted.  And Section 404 was\n\njust the latest part of an ongoing dialogue\n\nbetween Congress and the Commission, so it would\n\nbe improper to read 404 in isolation from that\n\ncontext.\n\nOn the career offender point, that\u0027s\n\njust a red herring in this case. There are (A)\n\nand (B) offenders that were also career\n\noffenders and they were fully eligible for\n\nrelief under Section 404. So that cannot be a\n\nbasis for excluding (b)(1)(C) offenders.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"75","file_name":"Terry v.
