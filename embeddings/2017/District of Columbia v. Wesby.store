PARKER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\n\nMR. PARKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThere are two fundamental errors in\n\nthe way that the lower courts analyzed the\n\nquestion of probable cause in this case.\n\nFirst, they took certain important\n\nfacts out of context, viewed them in isolation,\n\nand engaged in precisely the sort of\n\ndivide-and-conquer analysis that this Court has\n\nsaid is inappropriate.\n\nAnd the second is they concluded that\n\nbecause those facts were susceptible to\n\npossible innocent explanations, they could not\n\ncontribute to a finding of probable cause.\n\nNeither of those is correct. When\n\npolice officers encounter a criminal suspect,\n\nthey are required to draw fair inferences from\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n23\n\nOfficial\n\nthe entire constellation of facts, drawing on\n\npractical and commonsense experience. Those\n\nfacts will rarely be clear and often they will\n\npoint in different directions.\n\nAnd when they do, this Court has said\n\nrepeatedly that the possibility of competing\n\ninferences supports, not undermines, a finding\n\nof probable cause. That is especially true in\n\nthe case of mens rea, which is not directly\n\nknowable. The police officer cannot peer into\n\nthe head of the criminal suspect and know\n\nexactly what he or she is thinking.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"19","file_name":"District of Columbia v.
