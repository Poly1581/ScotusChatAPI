KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, this\n\nargument wouldn\u0027t be there if there was\n\nanything about reassessment, the way there are\n\nin about half the orders, including the Cuba\n\norder, which says it sunsets once the crisis\n\nends. There\u0027s nothing like that in this.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"38","file_name":"Trump v.

purely international\n\napplication. What -- what do we do about that?\n\nMR. KATYAL: Yeah, so two things.\n\nNumber one is I think the very fact that this\n\nis immigration cuts the other way. I mean, the\n\nheart of the First Amendment is about\n\nimmigration restrictions on, for example,\n\nCatholics at the founding and our protest of\n\nKing George, which is all about using the\n\nimmigration power to exclude people of a\n\ndifferent faith. And that\u0027s what our\n\nConstitution is about.
