It\u0027s a little bit confusing to me\n\nfrom the briefs.\n\nYou spent a lot of time talking about\n\nthe word \"decision\" and how habeas review is\n\nonly available for decisions, not for opinions.\n\nSo does your argument go that even\n\nwhen the -- a state court, the higher state\n\ncourt has issued a reasoned decision, that even\n\nthere the habeas court is not limited to that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\ndecision but can and should decide whether\n\nthere are other grounds?\n\nMS. WARREN: Justice Kagan, our\n\nposition is that 2254(d) always applies to the\n\ndecision, but when that last state court\n\nadjudication on the merits is reasoned, there\n\nis a textual basis in 2254(d) for the federal\n\nhabeas court to look at those reasons to help\n\nassess whether the decision itself is contrary\n\nto or involved in unreasonable application of\n\nthis Court\u0027s precedents.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"26","file_name":"Wilson v.

There are two courts that will always\n\npass on a habeas claim that is properly\n\nexhausted, first in the lower state court,\n\nwhere a reasoned opinion will ensue, and then\n\nthe Georgia Supreme Court, which will analyze\n\nthe application for CPC.\n\nAnd so to suggest that the Georgia\n\nSupreme Court should be written out altogether,\n\nI think, is also an affront to federalism and\n\nto comity. And to -- to require a presumption\n\nthat the Georgia Supreme Court has adopted\n\nthose lower state court reasonings similarly is\n\nan affront to federalism.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"40","file_name":"Wilson v.
