It is\n\ncertainly not the case here, where the\n\ngovernment told the jury repeatedly that Mr.\n\nMarinello had substantial gross income and took\n\nsubstantial personal income from that.\n\nExhibits 21 and 22 below and pages 516 to 518\n\nmake that point very clearly.\n\nFourth, the omissions theory as an\n\nalternative way of limiting this. Again, that\n\ndoesn\u0027t make sense of the statutes that are\n\nmisdemeanors, like forcible rescue, like\n\nwillful false statements, that are affirmative\n\nacts but less punishment than the -- than the\n\n7212 obstruction charge.\n\nThe last thing I want to say is we\n\nbelieve that based on the heritage of this\n\nlanguage and the fact that obstruction statutes\n\ntypically are focused on proceedings, that is\n\nthe interpretation we\u0027ve offered to the Court.\n\nBut as Justice Gorsuch and Justice\n\nSotomayor pointed out, there are other ways of\n\nreading the officers clause in conjunction with\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n67\n\nOfficial\n\nthe administration clause to come up with a\n\nmore limited standard that does not cover any\n\nof the context -- conduct in this case, act or\n\nomission.\n\nSo, for those reasons, we would ask\n\nthe Court to reverse.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"57","file_name":"Marinello v.
