Even beyond\n\nthe footnote in Bay Mills that the Chief\n\nJustice referenced, I think when you look at\n\nlanguage of the kind that appears in Bay Mills\n\nand in other cases, what -- which says that,\n\nyou know, if Congress wants to change it, it\u0027s\n\nup to Congress to change it, but the question\n\nis, what is the \"it\"?\n\nIn other words, what\u0027s up to Congress\n\nto change is deviations from the general law of\n\nsovereign immunity. And I think what the\n\nLundgrens are saying here is that this is not\n\npart of the general law of sovereign immunity.\n\nAnd this goes back to Justice Ginsburg\u0027s\n\nquestion, that sovereign immunity typically, by\n\ncommon law and historically, includes this\n\nexception for immovable property.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"12","file_name":"Upper Skagit Tribe v.

These issues are addressed\n\nevery day in contracts and in land transactions\n\nby the tribe either agreeing to waive\n\nvoluntarily or negotiating how disputes will be\n\nresolved.\n\nSo there is a mechanism, and that\u0027s\n\nbetween the parties who understand their place.\n\nEven in this situation, had the Lundgrens\n\noffered an opportunity to negotiate in\n\nrecognition of the tribe\u0027s immunity from suit,\n\nwe would have not -- we would have engaged in\n\nthat same process here.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I\u0027m sorry, there\n\nwas a negotiation, and I thought the\n\nnegotiation resulted in the tribe saying: No,\n\nwe want the land, we won\u0027t take money for it.\n\nWe won\u0027t exchange parcels for it.
