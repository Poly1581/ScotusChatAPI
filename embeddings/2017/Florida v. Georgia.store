GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Special Master based his\n\nrecommendation on two critical premises:\n\nFirst, that Florida has suffered real harm as a\n\nresult of Georgia\u0027s ever-increasing consumption\n\nof upstream waters; and, second, that Georgia\u0027s\n\nconsumption is unreasonable and largely\n\nunrestrained. In fact, the Special Master\n\nfound that Georgia\u0027s position practically,\n\npolitically, and legally is that it can consume\n\nas much water as it wishes without regard to\n\nany of the long-term consequences for the\n\nApalachicola region.\n\nThe Special Master nevertheless\n\nconcluded that this case should be terminated\n\nat the outset and that Georgia\u0027s wasteful\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nconsumption be allowed to continue unabated\n\nbecause Florida had failed to show an adequate\n\n-- adequate certainty of complete relief.\n\nWith respect to the Special Master, we\n\nbelieve he -- he made a legal error on this\n\ndiscrete issue, that the case should be\n\nreturned to him for him to complete the work\n\nthat he has begun.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, I\n\nthought that the Special Master -- this is at\n\npage 63 to 65 of his report -- said that\n\nFlorida at the trial concentrated only on the\n\nharm from the low flows in drought years and it","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"2","file_name":"Florida v.

In Idaho versus Oregon, the\n\nCourt asked, are there going to be numbers of\n\nfish justifying additional restrictions? And\n\nColorado versus New Mexico put the burden on\n\nthe state seeking to disrupt the status quo.\n\nThe burden to prove benefits of the diversion\n\nmust -- substantially outweigh the harms that\n\nmight result.\n\nNow, Florida told the Court, the\n\nSpecial Master at the beginning of this case,\n\nthis is a quote from Docket Number 125 at 29,\n\n\"If you conclude after a trial that caps on\n\nconsumption will not redress Florida\u0027s harm,\n\nthen Florida will not have proved its case.\"\n\nThat\u0027s exactly what happened here.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"48","file_name":"Florida v.
