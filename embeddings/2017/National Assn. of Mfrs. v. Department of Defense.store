BISHOP\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. BISHOP: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Clean Water Act provides for\n\njudicial review in the courts of appeals of\n\nseven categories of action by the EPA\n\nAdministrator, and those are defined narrowly\n\nand precisely in Section 1369(b)(1) of the Act.\n\nHad Congress meant for courts of\n\nappeals to review all national or definitional\n\nrules, it would have said so, as it did in the\n\nClean Air Act, instead of listing a handful of\n\nparticular EPA actions down to the statutory\n\nsubsection.\n\nOur textual approach to subsections\n\n(b)(1) and (E) -- (b)(1)(E) and (F) results in\n\na comparatively clear jurisdictional rule that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nwould eliminate many duplicative filings and\n\nyears of litigation over where to litigate.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen\n\nif two questions were presented? The first\n\ninvolves whether the water in question fits\n\nwithin \"waters of the United States\"; that\u0027s a\n\npreliminary question. And then there\u0027s a\n\nchallenge to a grant -- a grant or denial of a\n\npermit.\n\nIf you had those two combined, where\n\ndo they go?\n\nMR.

In Footnote 14\n\nof the DuPont case, which involved 1304(b)\n\nguidelines, this Court suggested that when you\n\nhave a challenge that includes actions covered\n\nby (E) or (F) and that are not covered by (E)\n\nor (F), that it may be possible to exercise\n\nancillary jurisdiction over the question not -­\n\nnot covered. Of course, the (b)(2) preclusion\n\nshould not apply in that case.\n\nBut, you know, in any event, the\n\nchallenge here is to the waters rule by itself.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nthings, putting -- I mean, obviously, your main\n\nemphasis is, of course, on the statutory\n\nlanguage, but one of the consequences that your\n\nopponent points out is that if you\u0027re correct\n\nand these actions are brought in the district\n\ncourt, each of the district courts will have to\n\nreview the entire administrative record, and\n\npresumably, you could have dozens of the\n\ndistrict courts engaged in that same activity,\n\nand then it would have to be done all over\n\nagain when you get to the court of appeals.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"3","file_name":"National Assn. of Mfrs. v.

limitation is \"a restriction\n\nestablished by the Administrator on quantities,\n\nrates, and concentrations.\" Well, once you\n\nhave that in mind, it\u0027s hard to agree with you,\n\nbecause it looks as if, given the fact that we\n\nhave (A), (C), (D), and then (E), which refer\n\nto those four sections, it would seem to do two\n\nthings: (F) says if they issue -- you know,\n\nyou don\u0027t -- you want them to issue a permit\n\nand they won\u0027t, to you, go ahead, you can go to\n\nthe court of appeals. A little unusual since\n\nit\u0027s fact-based, but nonetheless.\n\nAnd then the other four that I just\n\nmentioned seem to say if there are standards,\n\nwhich are like rules, and they\u0027re related to\n\nthe specific definition I told you about or the\n\nequivalent because \"standards of performance,\"\n\nafter all, is a different set of words than\n\n\"effluent limitations.\" But the \"other\n\nlimitations\" means something like that.\n\nAnd if that isn\u0027t the correct\n\ninterpretation, then what in heaven\u0027s name are\n\n(A), (C), (D), and (F) -- or what are (A), (C),\n\nand (D) doing there?
