The\n\nsecond one is that Congress used the term\n\n\"related to\" in nearby provisions of the\n\nstatute, in both 1926 and 1978, showing that\n\nwhen Congress meant \"relating to,\" the broadest\n\nconceivable definition, it said \"relating to.\"\n\nNot \"respecting.\"\n\nAnd the third reason is just the\n\nconsequences of Respondent\u0027s and the\n\ngovernment\u0027s rule. Their rule would render the\n\nbaseline rule in Section 523, that debts\n\nprocured by fraud are not dischargeable,\n\ninapplicable to a common fact pattern under\n\nSection 523, which is statements made about\n\none\u0027s finances to secure credit.\n\nNow the government itself on page 18\n\nof its brief recognizes that that is a common\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"18","file_name":"Lamar, Archer \u0026amp; Cofrin, LLP v.

HUGHES: Well, I think, Your\n\nHonor, the -- the point that we make is a -- is\n\na more limited one, which is to say if the sky\n\nwere falling in the Fourth Circuit, there would\n\nbe some evidence or some outcry from these very\n\nsubstantial jurisdictions. There would be some\n\nindication that there was a problem that -­\n\nthat came from this rule.\n\nSo we\u0027re using this -- the -- the\n\nabsence of evidence in the Fourth Circuit to\n\nsimply say that any view of a policy concern is\n\nsubstantially overblown, because there hasn\u0027t\n\nbeen any identification of even a single case\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"42","file_name":"Lamar, Archer \u0026amp; Cofrin, LLP v.
