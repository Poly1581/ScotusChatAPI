It has specific expenses, child\n\ncare and transportation, followed by a general\n\nresidual clause that looks absolutely nothing\n\nlike attorneys\u0027 fees.

HUSTON: If I might make two\n\npoints about that, Your Honor.\n\nThe first is that I don\u0027t really think\n\nthe American rule of attorneys\u0027 fees has much\n\nbearing on this case because that\u0027s a rule\n\nabout structuring correct incentives in civil\n\nlitigation. And that just doesn\u0027t translate to\n\nthe criminal context where Petitioner is the\n\nwrongdoer.\n\nAnd the second point is that the Crime\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n42\n\nOfficial\n\nVictims\u0027 Rights Act, which is cited in our -­\n\nin our brief at Section -- at page 14A of the\n\ngray brief, makes it explicit that Congress\n\ncontemplated victims would have a right to the\n\nassistance of counsel in order to do things\n\nlike participate in a crime -- a criminal\n\ndefendant\u0027s sentencing proceeding.\n\nIf you think, for example, about the\n\ncase of -- if my accountant calls me up and\n\nsays that I owe $5,000 to the IRS, but,\n\nactually, I only owe $1,000 and he just pockets\n\nthe whole amount, when that crime is\n\ndiscovered, I\u0027m going to need the assistance of\n\na second accountant in order to figure out how\n\nmuch I\u0027m defrauded, in order to be able to do\n\nthings like participate in the criminal\n\ndefendant\u0027s sentencing proceeding, file a\n\nvictim impact statement, and seek restitution.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"36","file_name":"Lagos v.

HUSTON: I think, Your Honor, that\n\n\"necessary\" in this statute plays a function\n\nsimilar to the word \"necessary\" in the statute\n\nthat the Court recently considered in Ayestas.\n\nIt means ordinary, reasonable, expected.\n\nAnd I want to stress that district\n\ncourts make those sort of determinations all\n\nthe time. They cut down restitution orders or\n\nrequested restitution orders because they find\n\nthat the expenses requested were\n\ndisproportionate to the task or that they\n\nweren\u0027t actually focused on the specific\n\noffense of conviction and that they were\n\nlooking into something else.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"44","file_name":"Lagos v.
