JACKLEY: Justice Sotomayor, I\n\nbelieve that the other side pointed to one\n\nstate, Connecticut, whose low-level\n\nrepresentative sent a letter asking it to apply\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\nprospectively from here forward.\n\nAnd I would point out that Attorney\n\nGeneral Jepsen, who signed the 45 state amicus\n\nbriefs, will actually be making that decision.\n\nAnd the true problem with retroactivity is, is\n\nwhat\u0027s at issue? What\u0027s at issue is not an\n\nassessment. It\u0027s a collection.\n\nSo what you would be doing is telling\n\na remote seller you don\u0027t have to collect and\n\nremit this, and then three years later you\n\nwould say: Oh, by the way, you do, and we\u0027ve\n\nnow changed that collection responsibility to a\n\npenalty and interest.\n\nAnd that has significant\n\nconstitutional concerns, which is why the\n\nstates aren\u0027t doing it and aren\u0027t likely going\n\nto do it.\n\nI truly believe that if you go to look\n\nat what is at issue here, it goes back to what\n\nI originally said.
