Stewart.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L.\n\nSTEWART\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR.\n\nSTEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis Court has often stressed the\n\nbreadth of Congress\u0027s constitutional authority\n\nto establish the rules under which aliens will\n\nbe allowed to enter and remain in the United\n\nStates.\n\nThis case squarely implicates that\n\nprinciple. During the pendency of Respondents\u0027\n\nremoval proceedings, the question whether\n\nmembers of a certified class will be detained\n\nand the question whether they will be allowed\n\ninto the United States are simply two sides of\n\nthe same coin.\n\nIn practical effect, Respondents\n\nassert a constitutional right to be released\n\ninto this country for the remainder of their\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nremoval proceedings if those proceedings last\n\nfor more than six months and the government\n\ncannot prove flight risk or dangerousness by\n\nclear and convincing evidence.\n\nThis Court\u0027s decisions make clear that\n\nRespondents have no such right. If I may, I\u0027d\n\nlike to begin with the arriving alien subclass.\n\nThe statutory provision that\u0027s most directly at\n\nissue for these purposes is at page 152a of the\n\npetition appendix.\n\nAnd this one deals particularly with\n\nwhat -- what I think is the most important\n\nsubset of the arriving alien subclass; that is,\n\nindividuals who come to the country for the\n\nfirst time, they pass a credible fear screening","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"2","file_name":"Jennings v.

ARULANANTHAM: Your Honor, let\u0027s\n\nleave the periodic part of that aside for just\n\na moment.\n\nAs for the initial six-month hearing,\n\nthe analogy there is to the -- the bond hearing\n\nthat you get within days promptly, as the Court\n\nsaid in Salerno, after your arrest in the\n\npretrial detention context. And if instead my\n\nfriend\u0027s position is correct, Your Honor, that\n\njust the fact that you\u0027re in deportation\n\nproceedings itself is sufficient to justify\n\nyour detention, then Congress could pass a law\n\nthat mandated the detention of every person in\n\nremoval proceedings.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"27","file_name":"Jennings v.
