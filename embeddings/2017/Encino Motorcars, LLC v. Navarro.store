It\n\nalso -- I think there\u0027s no argument that the\n\nstatute only covers farm implement partsmen.\n\nBased on its disjunctive structure, it\n\ncertainly covers, I think, automobile partsmen\n\nand partsmen at a truck dealership. And I\n\nthink equally importantly, it covers it without\n\nregard to whether they work outside or have\n\nunusual hours.\n\nAnd so I think what you have here is a\n\nclassic example of where Congress was impelled\n\nto include partsmen in the statute based on\n\nsome very specific concerns of specific\n\nsenators about farm dealer partsmen, but then\n\nthey expanded the statute quite a bit more\n\nsubstantially to cover all of the partsmen.\n\nOne other just footnote on that piece\n\nof the legislative action, I think it\u0027s\n\nactually interesting that when Congress first\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n9\n\nOfficial\n\nproposed adding partsmen, they proposed adding\n\npartsmen who were selling or servicing farm\n\nimplements.\n\nAnd so I think what that shows is that\n\nCongress may have actually had with selling or\n\nservicing not necessarily two siloed,\n\ndisjunctive terms but sort of the broader\n\nprocess of selling or servicing, because I\n\ndon\u0027t think partsmen ever sold the farm\n\nimplements themselves.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: One of the amicus\n\nbriefs talks about what partsmen did\n\nhistorically and makes the case that what","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"6","file_name":"Encino Motorcars, LLC v.

And I would ask\n\nyou, if you have the time, to look at that 1966\n\nentrance on the auto partsman counterman,\n\nbecause what it talks about is, you know, they\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n24\n\nOfficial\n\nreally -- sometimes they sell direct parts to\n\nretail customers.

FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe exemption in this case is for any\n\nsalesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily\n\nengaged in selling or servicing automobiles.\n\nThe most obvious reason why or the clearest\n\nreason why service advisors don\u0027t come within\n\nthat exemption is they don\u0027t service\n\nautomobiles.\n\nIn our brief, we cite five -- I think\n\nthe five most authoritative dictionaries of the\n\nEnglish language, and they define \"service\" -­\n\n\"to service\" as to maintain or repair. You\n\nmaintain -- you don\u0027t maintain or repair a car,\n\nin the way people would ordinarily speak, with\n\na pad or a clipboard and a pencil or a\n\ntelephone, which are the primary tools that\n\nservice advisors use.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\nYou do it back in the back of the shop","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"26","file_name":"Encino Motorcars, LLC v.

If the mechanic is -- needs a\n\nfan belt, is working on a car and walks over\n\ntwo steps or five steps or 10 steps to pick up\n\na fan belt off the wall and bring it back to\n\nthe car, I think the mechanic is that whole\n\ntime repairing or maintaining the car.\n\nAnd what the partsman is doing is\n\ntaking over a function, one part of the\n\nfunction of what the mechanic does, and instead\n\nthe partsman\u0027s doing it.

First\n\nof all, I\u0027d like to start with the reliance\n\nissue. I don\u0027t think it is factually accurate\n\nat all to say that when the 2011 regulation\n\ncame in, without any explanation that was\n\nultimately deemed procedurally invalid by this\n\nCourt, that dealerships just stopped what they\n\nwere doing and changed 40 years of practices.\n\nIf that had happened, this suit would\n\nnot have happened. I mean, the reality is that\n\nacross the country, based on that unexplained\n\nregulation, dealerships continued their\n\ntraditional practices. That\u0027s why the reliance\n\ninterests are all on our side of this case.\n\nNow, there are also reliance interests\n\nfor the treatment of body repairmen who have\n\nfrom the very beginning been treated as exempt\n\nat dealerships.\n\nNow, there is the letter that we cite","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"53","file_name":"Encino Motorcars, LLC v.
