CLEMENT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nPASPA does three basic things:\n\nFirst, it tells the states that they\n\nmay not themselves operate or advertise sports\n\ngambling schemes, such as a sports-based\n\nlottery or a sports book.\n\nSecond, it tells private parties, in\n\n3702(2), that they may not operate or advertise\n\na sports gambling scheme pursuant to state law.\n\nAnd, thirdly, it tells states that\n\nthey may not authorize or license third parties\n\nto conduct those sports gambling schemes that\n\nwould violate federal law.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Clement -­\n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it does so by\n\nthis mechanism. It leaves in place a state law\n\nthat the state does not want, so the citizens\n\nof the State of New Jersey are bound to obey a\n\nlaw that the state doesn\u0027t want but that the\n\nfederal government compels the state to have.\n\nThat seems commandeering.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nMR.

Well, I\u0027ll try to answer\n\nthe whole thing, but I\u0027ll start with the\n\nproposition that we know there\u0027s absolutely\n\nnothing wrong with congressional legislation\n\nthat operates on states as market actors.\n\nAnd that\u0027s what the first four\n\nprohibitions in 3702(1) plainly do. They tell\n\n-- tell the states, you can\u0027t operate,\n\nadvertise, sponsor, or promote sports gambling\n\nschemes. So that\u0027s okay. It also tells\n\nprivate parties that you can\u0027t do those four\n\nthings pursuant to state law. And keep in\n\nmind, those private parties can\u0027t do it as a\n\nmatter of federal law in violation of state law\n\nbecause it\u0027s a federal criminal prohibition.\n\nSo all that leaves, then, is the\n\nprovisions that they\u0027ve challenged, the license\n\nor authorize. And all those are, in the\n\ncontext of this statute, is an express\n\npreemption provision; which, of course it\u0027s\n\naddressed to the states and local governments,\n\nbecause states and local governments are the\n\nones that can pass laws that might be\n\npreempted.\n\nBut I don\u0027t think it creates any\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n42\n\nOfficial\n\nproblem. Think about it -- I think it\u0027s very\n\nanalogous to Baker. In Baker, Congress told\n\nthe states they couldn\u0027t have bearer bonds.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"35","file_name":"Christie v.

You just let everybody enforce it,\n\nand the enforcement priorities that Justice\n\nSotomayor alluded to work on the federal level\n\nas well.\n\nAnd if you preempt state law, that\n\ntends to not have a budgetary impact either.\n\nBut what\u0027s distinct about this is it basically\n\nsays, look, 46 states, if you want to regulate\n\nthis in 46 different ways, have at it.

is a commandeering problem, he\n\nsays, because New Jersey is forced to keep a\n\nlaw on its books and there\u0027s no accompanying\n\ncomprehensive federal regime. Both of those\n\narguments are incorrect.\n\nAs to the first, I\u0027d encourage the\n\nCourt to look at page 383 of the JA. The\n\ninjunction in this case does not remotely\n\nrequire the state to keep a law on its books.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n56\n\nOfficial\n\nIt says the state cannot give\n\noperation or effect to its preempted law. That\n\nis exactly, almost word-for-word, what Justice\n\nScalia said in Printz, the Supremacy Clause\n\nrequires. If the state passes a law that is\n\npreempted by federal law, the state can be\n\nrequired -- and state officials can be\n\nrequired -- not to give effect to that\n\npreempted law. That is not conscription in any\n\nmeaning of the -- of the word.\n\nAnd as to the second, I think this\n\ncomprehensive federal regime is -- is a made-up\n\nprinciple for the reasons Mr. Clement gives. A\n\nfederal statute often says states may not\n\nregulate interstate commerce in a particular\n\nway because the federal policy is just that the\n\nstates are to take their hands off of that\n\nparticular part of interstate commerce.\n\nBut even if the Court thinks it\u0027s a\n\nprinciple, it doesn\u0027t need to reach it here","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"48","file_name":"Christie v.
