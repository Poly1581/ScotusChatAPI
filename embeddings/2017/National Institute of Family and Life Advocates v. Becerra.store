in\n\nPennsylvania because they\u0027re not doing anything\n\nthat relates to the practice of medicine in\n\nthat context.\n\nBut taking the broader construction,\n\nif we\u0027re not going to gerrymander this and say:\n\nAll doctors who treat pregnant women have to\n\ngive all the options. If -- if that\u0027s the\n\ncase, doctors who advise to deliver and doctors\n\nwho advise to get abortions are going to be\n\nswept into this requirement.\n\nAnd the political ramifications of\n\nthat are enormous. We should not politicize\n\nthe practice of medicine in that way.
