It\u0027s just that the\n\n14 referenced issue can\u0027t be intertwined with the\n\n15 evidence that the inmate is seeking in the\n\n16 motion.\n\n17 So take the following example. A\n\n18 claim has two elements, element A and element\n\n19 B. And the record is fully developed with\n\n20 respect to element A, and the record is not\n\n21 going to get any better with respect to element\n\n22 A. And the inmate comes to court under 3599\n\n23 and asks for resources to develop element B.\n\n24 A court can decide the 3599 motion by\n\n25 reference to the merits if what it\u0027s doing is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n21\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"17","file_name":"Manuel Ayestas v.

But some circuits, including my old\n\n17 one, have distinguished Harbison in similar\n\n18 circumstances, pointing out that Harbison just\n\n19 dealt with the appointment, I believe, of\n\n20 clemency counsel, and the issue wasn\u0027t part of\n\n21 the final order in the merits of the habeas\n\n22 petition.\n\n23 Here, the denial of funding was part\n\n24 of the final order in the denial of a habeas\n\n25 petition. And as I read 2253, a final order in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n1 a habeas proceeding, you need a COA.\n\n2 Now, maybe you can say it\u0027s just\n\n3 independent and totally separate from that.\n\n4 But then that might suggest you\u0027d have to -­\n\n5 you\u0027d be able to appeal as a matter of right\n\n6 anytime a funding denial takes place, even\n\n7 before a final judgment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"21","file_name":"Manuel Ayestas v.

No, there isn\u0027t.\n\nThe review is -- concerns the\n\n9 amount of the funds.\n\nAnd here it strikes me\n\n10 that what we\u0027re dealing with is a simple\n\n11 question of statutory interpretation, what does\n\n12 13 -- 3599(f) require counsel to show to get\n\n13 funds for investigating the existence of a\n\n14 mitigation case?\n\n15 That sounds to me like a legal\n\n16 question, the kind of question that is fit for\n\n17 a court, not an administrative review.\n\n18 MR.

They saw that there\n\n19 had been no mental health expert that had\n\n20 examined the defendant, and that the trial\n\n21 counsel had failed to follow up on red flags.\n\n22 They saw in the state habeas file that\n\n23 state habeas counsel was told by his\n\n24 investigator nine days after he hired her that\n\n25 the first thing he had to do was a mitigation\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n67\n\nOfficial\n\n1 investigation and a social history, and he\n\n2 didn\u0027t do that.\n\n3 And we know that there\u0027s a there there\n\n4 because there is a diagnosis of schizophrenia\n\n5 in the record. It is inconceivable that a\n\n6 reasonable attorney, having received this file,\n\n7 getting this case, would do anything other than\n\n8 precisely what federal habeas counsel did in\n\n9 this case.\n\n10 And the reasonable attorney standard\n\n11 is the right standard because it is the\n\n12 standard that Congress picked.\n\n13 At the time Congress enacted Section\n\n14 3599, it knew that courts had spent 20 years\n\n15 defining reasonable necessity, using a\n\n16 reasonable attorney rule.\n\n17 And it\u0027s also the desirable rule\n\n18 because it gives effect to the dominant purpose\n\n19 of the statute, which is to promote parity in\n\n20 representation as between those capable of\n\n21 paying for it and those who aren\u0027t.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"59","file_name":"Manuel Ayestas v.
