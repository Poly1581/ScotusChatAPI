Because of the\n\nclarity with which the FAA speaks to enforcing\n\narbitration agreements as written, the FAA will\n\nonly yield in the face of a contrary\n\ncongressional command and the tie goes to\n\narbitration. Applying those principles to\n\nSection 7 of the NLRA, the result is clear that\n\nthe FAA should not yield.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"3","file_name":"Epic Systems Corp. v.

CLEMENT: I have two responses to\n\nthat, Justice Ginsburg. First, the Board\n\ndoesn\u0027t even take it that far. They agree that\n\narbitration agreements, as long as what\u0027s at\n\nissue is an individual claim, are perfectly\n\nfine and perfectly valid.\n\nSo this isn\u0027t a principle that says\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n12\n\nOfficial\n\nthat the employee\u0027s position is so weak they\n\ncan\u0027t agree to arbitrate at all.\n\nThe second part of that is I suppose\n\nthat\u0027s one way of asking the question in this\n\ncase, is a bilateral arbitration agreement,\n\nsomething that has been protected by the FAA\n\nsince 1925, is that really -- because all it\n\nseeks to do is preserve what this Court on\n\nthree occasions has referred to as a\n\nfundamental attribute of arbitration, is that\n\nreally a \"yellow dog\" contract?\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement -­\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn\u0027t it -- isn\u0027t","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"10","file_name":"Epic Systems Corp. v.

No one questions\n\nthat the FLSA permits the employees here to\n\nforgo collective actions and arbitrate their\n\nFLSA claims. In giving employees the right to\n\nact in concert, the NLRA does not then extend\n\nto concerted activities that they have validly\n\nagreed to waive under other federal statutes\n\nlike the FLSA and the FAA. And for decades,\n\nthrough the 2010 general counsel memo and until\n\nD.R. Horton five years ago, the Board\n\nrecognized as much. Sections 7 and 8 were\n\nunderstood as protecting employees -­\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wall, what\n\nabout -­\n\nMR.

That\u0027s why this is\n\ntruly a situation where there is strength in\n\nnumbers, and that was the core idea of the\n\nNLRA. There is strength in numbers.

The way a proceeding\n\nunder the National Labor Relations Act works is\n\nthe Board doesn\u0027t have any independent\n\ninvestigatory authority or ability to initiate\n\nsuits on its own.\n\nWhat happens is charges are filed.\n\nThose charges are filed by employers,\n\nemployees, individuals -- they could be filed\n\nby a group of as many employees as you want.\n\nThe general counsel of the Board\n\nacting through the regions decides whether or\n\nnot to pursue the complaint, and then the\n\ngeneral counsel proceeds in the public interest\n\nto litigate the case administratively.\n\nSo it\u0027s not the type of proceeding\n\nthat -- that lends itself to the concept of\n\nclass actions, but it doesn\u0027t stop as many\n\nemployees as want to. And, in fact, frequently\n\nthe union will be filing a charge that\u0027s a\n\nrepresentative charge in very much the same way","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"37","file_name":"Epic Systems Corp. v.
