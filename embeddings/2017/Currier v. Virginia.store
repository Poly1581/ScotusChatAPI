The first is, is because, at\n\nthat level of generality, I see your point, but\n\nif you look at the specific right involved in\n\nJeffers, the defendant requested two trials and\n\nthen tried to stop the second trial. So that\n\nis fundamentally taking inconsistent positions.\n\nHere, Mr. Currier simply consented to\n\nseparate trials. He didn\u0027t object to the\n\nsecond trial as such.

Right? That really\n\nis inconsistent. If you\u0027re insisting on\n\nmultiple trials, or preferring multiple trials,\n\nthen you can\u0027t assert your right against\n\nmultiple trials.\n\nBut that\u0027s not this case. Somebody\n\ncan say I want two trials and still have it in\n\nhis view that, in that second trial, normal\n\nissue preclusion principles will apply. So\n\nsometimes that will prevent the second trial,\n\nbut sometimes it won\u0027t prevent the second trial\n\nbecause the government can prove its case\n\nanother way.\n\nAnd so there\u0027s no inconsistency of the\n\nkind that exists in claim preclusion in this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n46\n\nOfficial\n\nkind of case, is there?\n\nMR.

And it\u0027s also important\n\nto explain why having an evidentiary rule here\n\nwould be problematic in a number of ways.\n\nFor example, here, one piece of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial\n\nevidence that comes up a lot from my friend on\n\nthe other side is the cigarette butt with the\n\nDNA that was found in the car. And they say,\n\nwell, that didn\u0027t get into evidence at the\n\nfirst trial, but it was introduced at the\n\nsecond, so in some sense, it\u0027s -- you\u0027re seeing\n\nthe dry run problem.\n\nBut it\u0027s not clear why that evidence\n\nwouldn\u0027t come in anyway in the second trial.\n\nIt\u0027s not linked necessarily to the burglary.\n\nIt\u0027s just a cigarette butt in the truck.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"44","file_name":"Currier v.

ROSS: That\u0027s correct, Justice\n\nSotomayor. And the reason why we don\u0027t allow\n\nyou to try that second acquittal or that second\n\noffense is because, for purposes of the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause and for purposes of how we\n\ndefine the same offense, we say that in those\n\ncircumstances, just as in Blockburger we say\n\nthat sometimes things that are technically\n\ndistinct, meaning they\u0027re in different code\n\nsections, are the same offense because they\n\nhave overlapping elements.\n\nHere, we say that they\u0027re the same\n\noffense because they have over -- an issue of\n\nultimate fact that the prosecution necessarily\n\nmust prove in both cases.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n66\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"58","file_name":"Currier v.
