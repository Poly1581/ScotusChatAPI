JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear\n\nargument first this morning in Case 16-1161,\n\nGill versus Whitford.\n\nMr. Tseytlin?\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MISHA TSEYTLIN\n\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS\n\nMR. TSEYTLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis Court has never uncovered\n\njudicially manageable standards for determining\n\nwhen politicians have acted too politically in\n\ndrawing district lines. Plaintiff\u0027s social\n\nscience metrics composed of statewide vote to\n\nseat ratios and hypothetical projections do not\n\nsolve any of these problems.\n\nInstead, they would merely shift\n\ndistricting from elected public officials to\n\nfederal courts, who would decide the fate of\n\nmaps based upon battles of the experts.\n\nNow, as a threshold matter, this Court\n\nshould hold that federal courts lack\n\njurisdiction to entertain statewide political\n\ngerrymandering challenges, leaving for another\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nday the question of district-specific\n\ngerrymandering challenges.\n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think it\u0027s\n\ntrue that there\u0027s no case that directly helps\n\nRespondents very strongly on the standing\n\nissue. You have a -- a strong argument there.\n\nBut suppose the Court -- and you just\n\nhave to assume, we won\u0027t know exactly the\n\nparameters of it -- decided that this is a\n\nFirst Amendment issue, not an equal protection\n\nissue.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"2","file_name":"Gill v.

And I think the reason for that is,\n\neven if it\u0027s a First Amendment issue, it\u0027s\n\nstill grounded in the right to vote.\n\nAnd in our country\u0027s single district\n\nelection system, folks only vote in their own\n\ndistrict. For example, you might have some\n\nvague interest in the party that you associate\n\nwith having more members in Congress, for\n\nexample, like a Wisconsin Republican might want\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nmore Texas Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut no one would say that you have a\n\nFirst Amendment or a first -- Fourteenth\n\nAmendment right in that sort of circumstance to\n\nchallenge some Texas law that you would, for\n\nexample, argue led to less Republicans from\n\nTexas coming to the Congress.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I\n\n-- I think the argument is pretty\n\nstraightforward which you, in your district,\n\nhave a right of association and you want to\n\nexercise that right of association with other\n\npeople elsewhere in the state.\n\nAnd if you can\u0027t challenge the\n\ndistricting throughout the state, then your\n\nclaim seems to be -- there\u0027s no way for to you\n\nto raise your claim.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"3","file_name":"Gill v.

SMITH\n\nON BEHALF OF APPELLEES\n\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nWhat the state is asking for here is a\n\nfree pass to continue using an assembly map\n\nthat is so extreme that it effectively\n\nnullifies democracy.\n\nAs this case illustrates, it\u0027s now\n\npossible even in a 50/50 state like Wisconsin\n\nto draw a district map that is so reliably and\n\nextremely biased that it effectively decides in\n\nadvance who\u0027s going to control the legislative\n\nbody for the entire decade.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe we can\n\njust talk briefly about the standing issue.\n\nIt is a little arresting to have a\n\nrule that we establish that when your claim is\n\nracial gerrymandering, it has to be limited to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"25","file_name":"Gill v.

is nothing\n\nnew before this Court.\n\nSecond, we\u0027ve heard something about\n\nthe various tests that they\u0027re now proposing.\n\nThere was only one test that was subjected to\n\nadversarial scrutiny in this case, in a\n\nfour-day trial. That efficiency gap test\n\nproved so fatally flawed that the District\n\nCourt rejected it as the test and Plaintiffs\n\nabandoned it as the primary test on appeal.\n\nAnd then my final point about the\n\nscare tactics, about what will happen next.\n\nPlaintiff\u0027s expert did a comprehensive study\n\nfrom 1972 at the -- when the Baker\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n65\n\nOfficial\n\nredistricting had happened, to 2014.
