their\n\nvictims were drawn into a long, bitter, and\n\noften futile search for scarce assets that\n\nwould be subject to execution under the\n\nexceedingly narrow commercial exception to\n\nforeign

fact, the Petitioners\u0027 position\n\nabout the construction of 1610(g) is wrong for\n\nfour independently sufficient reasons.\n\nOne is\n\nthe language the Court has focused on, \"as\n\nprovided in this section.\" This section, is\n\nSection 1610, that is the section of which (g)\n\nis a subsection. So the phrase \"as provided in\n\nthis section\" means the Petitioners have to\n\nsatisfy the provisions of 1610, which means\n\nthat only property used for commercial activity\n\nin the United States can be seized. And\n\nPetitioners, I think, have just not come up\n\nwith a plausible alternative account of what\n\n\"as provided in this section\" means.\n\nBut there\u0027s a second reason. And it\n\nhas to do with the difference between\n\nsubsection (g) and the provisions of subsection\n\n1610 that really do abrogate sovereign\n\nimmunity. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\n\nsays, in Section 1609, that the property of\n\nforeign states in the U.S. shall be immune from\n\nattachment, except as provided in 1610.\n\nThen the subsections of 1610 say in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\nterms one after another that certain property\n\nshall not be immune.
