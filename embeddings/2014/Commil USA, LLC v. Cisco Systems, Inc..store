actually not the burden if you challenge it before the \n\n25 PTO.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\n1  But it is a high burden, and it\u0027s \n\n2 appropriately high because once a patent is declared \n\n3 invalid, it is unenforceable against anybody for all \n\n4 time and under principles of ­­ under the Blonder­Tongue \n\n5

 MR.\n\nWAXMAN:  Well, I ­­ I want to get to my \n\n16 last point about what the jury will be instructed, but\n\n17 let me first, with all due respect, take on that \n\n18 assertion. \n\n19  When Congress enacted Section 271(b) and \n\n20 Section 271(c) in 1952, both the House report and the \n\n21 Senate report said two things about those provisions: \n\n22 Number one, that they were enacted to reflect common law \n\n23 principles of aiding and abetting liability, and that \n\n24 they were thus, quote, \"an expression of law and \n\n25 morals.\"\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\n1  And this Court in Global­Tech precisely \n\n2 recognized that these provisions are, in fact, the \n\n3 modern day statutory version of civil aiding and \n\n4 abetting.  The Federal Circuit has always recognized it. \n\n5 And aiding and abetting at common law absolutely require \n\n6 knowledge of wrongdoing. \n\n7  And just to get to your original question, \n\n8 in a case in which the jury has found that the patent is \n\n9 valid and the plaintiff goes on to say, you know, and \n\n10 there was appropriate scienter because ­­ and it\u0027s quite \n\n11 unlike this case because there was no letter ­­ a letter \n\n12 was sent saying, I have this, the \u0027395 patent, and \n\n13 here\u0027s why you infringe it, you\u0027ve heard the defendant \n\n14 explain why he or she or it nonetheless had a reasonable \n\n15
