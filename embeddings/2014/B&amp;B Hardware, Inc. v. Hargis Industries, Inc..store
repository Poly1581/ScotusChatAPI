to give his all the first time because the judgment can \n\n16 be preclusive in future litigation. \n\n17  But ­­ and I think that the reasons to pay \n\n18 attention to registration in the circumstances that you \n\n19 gave are significant ones, because if he just lets Louis \n\n20 Vuitton sit there in the market with a registration for \n\n21 5 years, and Louis Vuitton\u0027s mark becomes incontestable \n\n22 then he has to face the consequences of that. \n\n23  So I think that people who are already in \n\n24

But if they don\u0027t want to go to the \n\n2 board, they don\u0027t have to go to the board.  No one ever \n\n3 has to go to the board who doesn\u0027t want to, because you \n\n4 always have the option of pursuing the cancellation \n\n5 relief or getting a mark cancelled or getting your mark \n\n6 registered.  You can do that in district court coupled \n\n7 with an infringement action. \n\n8  So if you are the senior mark holder, sue \n\n9 for infringement and you\u0027ll have a jury trial, right. \n\n10

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  One of the amicus briefs \n\n23 suggests that this is very, very much less expensive, so\n\n24 that it\u0027s like 10 percent of the cost of an infringement \n\n25 suit.  Why is that?\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\n1  MR. BASH:  Because in an infringement suit, \n\n2 the most discovery­intensive aspects, I think, are often \n\n3 damages and injunctive relief.  In other words, you \n\n4 really have to look at the other side\u0027s books to know \n\n5 how many of these products did you sell, what were your \n\n6

just talk a little bit about, do you think that this is \n\n20 an unusual case in that the issues are the same or a \n\n21 usual case? \n\n22  MR. BASH:  I don\u0027t have statistics, so I\u0027m \n\n23 sort of speaking just from my experience reading \n\n24 the case law.  But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s terribly unusual. \n\n25

conduct a searching inquiry to figure out what was at \n\n13 issue in the first administrative proceeding.\n\nYou look\n\n14 at the registration.  If no common law rights are at \n\n15 issue on the opposition side, you look at the opposer\u0027s \n\n16 registration, and you say, okay, this was about cars \n\n17 sold to retail consumers; that\u0027s what was at issue in \n\n18 the board proceeding.  If now we\u0027re talking about cars \n\n19 sold to government or municipal entities, that is \n\n20 potentially a materially different issue.  And then you \n\n21 have to make the sort of materiality judgment that \n\n22 courts make every day. \n\n23  But I guess I just want to close with I \n\n24

registration provision uses the word ­­ the phrase, \"so \n\n2 resembles\" and the infringement provision 1114 uses the \n\n3 phrase \"used in commerce.\"  I mean, as you can just see \n\n4 from the text of the provisions, they both are about the \n\n5 marks being used in commerce and whether the marks used \n\n6 in commerce would confuse people. \n\n7  If I could just finish one sentence.  The ­­\n\n8 and in the infringement provision, the phrase \"colorable \n\n9 imitation\" is defined, as the reply brief points out, as \n\n10 \"so resembles.\"  So the textual provisions are precisely \n\n11 parallel. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"26","file_name":"B\u0026amp;B Hardware, Inc. v.
