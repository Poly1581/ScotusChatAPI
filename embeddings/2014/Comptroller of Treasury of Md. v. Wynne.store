might have.  So Illinois might impose a 3 percent rate, \n\n12 Idaho a 5 percent rate, and Iowa an 8 percent rate. \n\n13  And the third thing is that the resident tax \n\n14 is the only one that the taxpayers actually have some \n\n15 political power to get in there and to influence. \n\n16  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your answer that you \n\n17 gave to my ­­ the hypothetical of 100 percent, that \n\n18 would be a burden on 100 percent of interstate commerce, \n\n19 because a resident who did not go into interstate \n\n20

explaining to the Chief Justice, one could file a \n\n6 perhaps more persuasive brief challenging the \n\n7 nonresident tax which the Maryland taxpayers exposed and \n\n8

I mean, the special \n\n6 nonresident tax is set at a particular level in relation \n\n7 to the county tax.  It is obviously intended to reach \n\n8 nonresidents in a way that the county tax reaches \n\n9 residents.  I\u0027m not sure you can artificially separate \n\n10 them. \n\n11  MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Maryland has upheld the \n\n12 special nonresident tax, not on the ground that it\u0027s not \n\n13 discriminatory.  The Maryland courts recognize the \n\n14 special nonresident tax as discriminatory, which the \n\n15 county income tax clearly is not, and they\u0027ve upheld it \n\n16 under this Court\u0027s compensatory tax doctrine.  Whether \n\n17 the Maryland courts were right on that or whether they \n\n18 wrong on that, I don\u0027t think it should affect the \n\n19 validity of the county income tax, which is the question \n\n20 presented in this case. \n\n21  But the reason I think that nonresident \n\n22 taxes can peacefully coexist with resident taxes is that \n\n23 although they are both income taxes, they are on \n\n24 distinct jurisdictional rationales, and when two taxes \n\n25 are imposed on the same value based on distinct\n\n24\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1

Look, we can\u0027t and don\u0027t want to \n\n7 constitutionalize everything about State taxation. \n\n8 Different States impose different taxes, impose \n\n9

But the line we\u0027re going to draw, and it\u0027s the \n\n12 line the internal consistency test draws, is that we\u0027re \n\n13 not going to allow States to structure their taxes so \n\n14 that they are taxing more than one ­­ they\u0027re exposing \n\n15 income to more than 100 percent of the tax base. \n\n16  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Perella, suppose we \n\n17

That would mean, I suppose, that the Maryland resident \n\n21 owes nothing to Maryland because he could take a credit \n\n22 for all what he\u0027s ­­ leaving the residents without \n\n23

the State schools and everything else that comes along \n\n15 with being a State resident. \n\n16  MR. PERELLA:  All right.  Well, perhaps, \n\n17

to be very different from a net income tax going all the \n\n11 way back to 1918 in U.S. Glue.  And the reason was \n\n12 because it was viewed as taxing the transaction itself. \n\n13 The net income from the transaction is different.  It\u0027s \n\n14 the thing that the person receives and enjoys in their \n\n15 home State.  And people choose to live in States for \n\n16
