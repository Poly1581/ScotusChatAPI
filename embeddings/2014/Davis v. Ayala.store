pretext for race. \n\n5  With respect to Olanders D, this juror gave \n\n6 responses that were not only not responsive, but they \n\n7 were responses that would cause any prosecutor to have \n\n8 doubt about that particular juror serving on a capital \n\n9 case.  There were clearly grounds for the prosecutor to \n\n10 have wanted to excuse that juror. \n\n11  But most importantly, the California Supreme \n\n12 Court looked at this record and it found support for the \n\n13 assertions in the record; with respect to Olanders D., \n\n14

standard, the Chapman standard, and found no harm.  And \n\n21 to proceed without regard for the State court\u0027s very \n\n22 careful determination in that regard seems antithetical \n\n23
