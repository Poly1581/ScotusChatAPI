First, you\u0027ve got \n\n5  22 States there, States in both camps, all of whom told \n\n6  you that they didn\u0027t understand the statute that way. \n\n7  Now, with respect to the other 8 States that \n\n8  filed the amicus brief on the other side, I actually \n\n9  think there\u0027s quite an important point that goes to \n\n10  their understanding of what this Act did.  Remember, \n\n11  this is an IRS rule that we\u0027re talking about here, and \n\n12  the IRS put out a notice of proposed rulemaking saying \n\n13

 if you look at those rulemaking comments you will see \n\n17  that they address a number of issues, and they say \n\n18  nothing, nothing about the ­­ the issue that\u0027s before \n\n19  the Court now. \n\n20  So if they really understood the statute as \n\n21  denying subsidies in States that did not set up their \n\n22  own exchanges, that would have front and center in their \n\n23  rulemaking comments, but they said nothing about it and \n\n24

 JUSTICE ALITO:  As I understand your answer \n\n18  to be that there are Federal regulations telling the \n\n19  States what they have to do here, and they\u0027ve all done \n\n20  it.  But the fact remains that the State has some \n\n21  obligation under the regulations to make sure that there \n\n22  is a proper interface with the Federal Exchange. \n\n23  GENERAL VERRILLI:  On the State\u0027s side of \n\n24  the interface, yes.  But that\u0027s the CHIP and Medicaid \n\n25  agencies.  Those are State government agencies, and it\u0027s\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n70\n\nOfficial\n\n1  their side of the interface that the statute governs. \n\n2

I mean, I really do want to focus on this point \n\n6  about the qualified health plan and the qualified \n\n7  individual, because the statute is quite clear in \n\n8  Section 1311 that an Exchange, not an Exchange \n\n9  established by the State, but an Exchange can only sell \n\n10  a qualified health plan.  It is forbidden from selling a \n\n11  health plan that is not a qualified health plan.  And \n\n12  that\u0027s not an Exchange established by the State.  It is \n\n13  an Exchange. \n\n14

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  So ­­\n\n6  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it ­­ it seems to me a \n\n7  little odd that the director of Internal Revenue\n\n8

 that with respect to Chevron deference.  First, we do \n\n12  think Chevron deference clearly supports the government \n\n13  here and I\u0027ll explain why.  But before you get to that, \n\n14  you can resolve and should resolve this statute and the \n\n15  statute\u0027s meaning in our favor even without resort to \n\n16  Chevron deference.  That\u0027s what the canon of reading a \n\n17  statute as a whole to make it work harmoniously directs \n\n18  you to do.  It\u0027s what the very important principles of \n\n19  Federalism that we\u0027ve been describing here direct you to \n\n20  do.  If you think there\u0027s a constitutional problem with \n\n21  the statute, it\u0027s what the doctrine of constitutional \n\n22  avoidance directs you to do. \n\n23  Now, with respect to Chevron, Section 36B(g) \n\n24  of the statute expressly delegates to the IRS the \n\n25  specific authority to make any decisions necessary to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n76\n\nOfficial\n\n1  implement Section 36B.  So you don\u0027t have any ambiguity. \n\n2  Congress said the IRS should do this.  It is a big \n\n3

 Congress said the IRS should do this.\n\nIt is a big \n\n3  question, but as the Court said in City of Arlington two\n\n4  terms ago, Chevron applies to big questions as well as \n\n5
