was to not ­­ to deny Kevan Brumfield a hearing on his \n\n12 claim of intellectual disability.  That decision was \n\n13 based on an entirely unreasonable determination of the \n\n14 facts of Brumfield\u0027s mental condition.  The court \n\n15 specifically ­­ the court expressly stated in its decision \n\n16 to deny a hearing was, quote, \"based on the three bases\" \n\n17
