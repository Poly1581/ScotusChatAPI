 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I ­­ I think that ­­\n\n23 the reason why I think it\u0027s a close question as to \n\n24 whether or not that would be a statement of opinion is \n\n25 simply because the second restatement\u0027s definition of\n\n4\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 what constitutes a statement of opinion, which we think \n\n2 is a useful guide, includes not just statements on \n\n3 matters of judgment, like the statements we have at \n\n4 issue here, but also statements that express uncertainty \n\n5 about factual matters. \n\n6  And I think in your hypothetical, Mr. Chief \n\n7 Justice, you can view that statement as being the \n\n8 equivalent of a factual statement that along the lines \n\n9 of, we have approximately 3 million units or widgets in \n\n10 our inventory, such that if they had nowhere near that, \n\n11 that statement would be an objectively false statement \n\n12 of fact and, therefore, actionable. \n\n13  JUSTICE BREYER:  But suppose it is actually \n\n14 disputed, an expert ­­ expert ­­ a museum expert on an \n\n15 archaeological mission says, it is my opinion that those \n\n16 bones in that mountain are of a diplodocus and not a \n\n17 Trisopterus.  Now, wouldn\u0027t you have thought that at \n\n18 least he\u0027d looked into it, that at least he\u0027d seen the \n\n19 bones?  You see, it\u0027s absolutely open, it is a matter of \n\n20 opinion, but there\u0027s some things implied. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"3","file_name":"Omnicare, Inc. v.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I think that in the \n\n3 context of legal compliance, if statements of the sort \n\n4 that we have at issue here, I think that ­­ that that \n\n5 context in many ways illustrates the potential \n\n6 difference. \n\n7  So suppose you had an issuer who had two \n\n8 separate legal opinions, one suggesting that a \n\n9 particular practice was legal and the other one was not. \n\n10 Certainly there, I think you would say that the issuer \n\n11 has at least some basis, but it may be open to \n\n12 after­the­fact determination as to whether or not that \n\n13 was a reasonable basis in light of the fact that there \n\n14 was a competing opinion. \n\n15  Again, it\u0027s entirely unclear exactly what \n\n16 that standard means, I think, in part because it’s a novel standard. \n\n17  JUSTICE BREYER:  I think Justice Scalia is \n\n18 right there, and there would be something like that, \n\n19 but ­­ and so your point is a ­­ is a good point, that \n\n20 it isn\u0027t so easy to figure this out exactly what the \n\n21 standard is.  The alternative, of course, is to issue \n\n22 registration statements that have statements in them of \n\n23 opinion, very detailed, very fact­based, and where \n\n24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shanmugam, I thought \n\n2 that the complaint alleged that the defendants had no ­­\n\n3 that no defendant had a reasonable ground to believe \n\n4 that Omnicare’s arrangements were lawful. \n\n5  MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, and that was going to \n\n6 be my second point, Justice Ginsburg.  So just to be \n\n7 clear, there are two paragraphs of the complaint that we \n\n8 think are relevant here.  The first is Paragraph 178, \n\n9 which is the paragraph in which the plaintiffs \n\n10 disclaimed any allegation relying on fraud or \n\n11 intentional misconduct.  And we think that under our \n\n12 legal standard that forecloses plaintiffs in this case \n\n13 from going forward.  I would note that plaintiffs don\u0027t \n\n14 really dispute that under our legal standard their claim \n\n15 is foreclosed.  They make no effort in their brief to \n\n16 suggest that their claim could nevertheless go forward. \n\n17  Now, if this Court were to adopt the \n\n18 Solicitor General\u0027s legal standard and to say that the \n\n19 legal standard here is whether or not there was a \n\n20 reasonable basis for the opinion, this Court would \n\n21 obviously have to vacate and remand because that was not \n\n22 the legal standard that the Sixth Circuit applied.  We \n\n23 think that we would have a very strong argument on \n\n24 remand that we should, nevertheless, prevail because the \n\n25

conclusory allegation that you identified, \n\n2 Justice Ginsburg, and that is the allegation in \n\n3 Paragraph 183 that says that none of the defendants had \n\n4 a reasonable ground to believe in the statements in the \n\n5 registration statement. \n\n6  If the inquiry in this case focuses on how \n\n7 the speaker arrived at its opinion, this complaint is \n\n8 really threadbare in terms of allegations that relate to \n\n9 that issue, and so we\u0027ve ­­ but that would be an issue \n\n10 for the Sixth Circuit on remand. \n\n11  JUSTICE ALITO:  If the test is subjective as \n\n12 you claim, with respect to the issuer, whose subjective \n\n13 state of mind should ­­ must the Court look at?  Would \n\n14 it be solely the person who signs on behalf of the \n\n15 issuer, or would it be everyone else who is required by \n\n16 law to sign the registration statement? \n\n17  MR. SHANMUGAM:  So I think that the inquiry \n\n18 would be much the same as the inquiry with regard to \n\n19 claims that have a scienter requirement, such as claims \n\n20 under Section 10(b).  I would note that there is a \n\n21 little bit of disagreement in the lower courts about how \n\n22 broad the category of individuals at an issuer is, whose \n\n23 state of mind is relevant, but the inquiry generally \n\n24 focuses on those who either made or approved the \n\n25 statement at issue.\n\n18\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"16","file_name":"Omnicare,

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Shanmugam, suppose that \n\n2 in a particular registration statement there was a \n\n3 statement that said a particular kind of transaction was \n\n4 lawful, all right, and the person who makes that \n\n5 statement, whoever it is, really believes it.  But, in \n\n6 fact, that person knows that the Government is breathing \n\n7 down his neck, that the Government seems to have a \n\n8 different view.  That person knows that its competitors \n\n9 have a different view.  And that person has also \n\n10 consulted three lawyers, and two of them have given a \n\n11 different view.  But he still believes what he believes. \n\n12 He believes that the Supreme Court is going to vindicate \n\n13 his legal position. \n\n14  But the only thing he says is, I think this \n\n15 is lawful.  Now, why isn\u0027t that something where there is \n\n16

that the only fact that is being disclosed by the \n\n20 statement is the fact of the speaker\u0027s belief, and if \n\n21 you look at the relevant language on which respondents \n\n22 and the Government really focus, it is that language \n\n23 concerning omissions.  It\u0027s not the language concerning \n\n24 falsity.

obviously a spectrum of potential bases for the opinion \n\n3 that the speaker could have, and so, again, we don\u0027t \n\n4 think that there is any necessary implication about the \n\n5

 And our view is simply that it is not worth \n\n18 the candle to frame the legal standard in a way as to \n\n19 cover that entirely hypothetical situation. \n\n20  And in part, to get back to \n\n21

 And in part, to get back to \n\n21 Justice Sotomayor\u0027s question from the beginning of the\n\n22 argument, that is because it is important to underscore \n\n23 the fact that this is a statute that imposes strict \n\n24 liability.  And as this Court explained in Pinter versus \n\n25 Dahl, when it comes to statutes that impose strict\n\n22\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 liability, issuers really need to have certainty and \n\n2 predictability. \n\n3  And a legal standard that focuses on \n\n4 reasonable basis is going to open up issuers to \n\n5 after­the­fact second­guessing by jurors about whether \n\n6 or not a particular basis is reasonable. \n\n7  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I don\u0027t think, \n\n8 Mr. Shanmugam, that the fact that the statue has ­­ is a \n\n9 strict liability statute might cut the other way.  Why \n\n10 is it a strict liability statute?  Because Congress had \n\n11 some understanding, number one, that it was the issuer \n\n12 who knows the facts, not the readers; and number two, \n\n13 that it is awfully hard to show subjective intent. \n\n14  MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, Congress dealt with \n\n15 the context of registration statements precisely by \n\n16 relaxing the other elements of liability that of course \n\n17 exist under other provisions of the securities laws. \n\n18 And what that leaves us with is a statute where this \n\n19 falsity element is really the entire ball game because \n\n20

the Trump case, the Weiss case that\u0027s cited in our \n\n6 brief. \n\n7  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that there are \n\n8 specific omissions in this case? \n\n9  MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, the case wasn\u0027t really \n\n10 pleaded the way that we conceive of it in terms of the \n\n11 lack of a reasonable basis, so we do think the \n\n12 appropriate thing for the Court to do would be to \n\n13 provide appropriate instructions to the lower courts, \n\n14 send this case back, and potentially allow this case to \n\n15 be repleaded because of the fact that we do think there \n\n16 was a kernel of this lack of reasonable basis idea in \n\n17 two places in the complaint in this case. \n\n18  The one is the relatively conclusory \n\n19 statement in Section 183 of the complaint that there was \n\n20 not a reasonable basis, but then there was also, as \n\n21 Mr. Goldstein noted, paragraphs 89 and 90 of the \n\n22 complaint, which were specific facts that were alleged \n\n23 about the company\u0027s attorney saying with respect to one \n\n24 of the specific contracts, this contract has all the \n\n25 kick ­­ the hallmarks of a kickback, an illegal kickback,\n\n49\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 and that is the kind of thing that potentially is an \n\n2 omission that could be material and could make the other \n\n3 statements in the registration statement misleading if \n\n4

 First of all, I want to focus on the text of \n\n6 the statute.  And to go to the colloquy, Justice Kagan, \n\n7 that you and I were having, and the similar colloquy \n\n8 that you also had with my colleagues at the bar, whether \n\n9 or not there is a reasonable basis is not a fact that \n\n10 can be said to be omitted, and that is for the precise \n\n11 reason that this test is not simply a \"some basis\" \n\n12 standard.  This is a reasonable basis standard that \n\n13 requires some evaluation of whether the basis is \n\n14 sufficient. \n\n15  And so that is really a judgment.  It is \n\n16 really a matter of opinion, and I don\u0027t think that it \n\n17 can fairly be said to be a fact that is omitted.  And \n\n18 again, as I suggested earlier ­­\n\n19  JUSTICE KAGAN:  But there might be omitted \n\n20 facts, such as I didn\u0027t check with any of my lawyers, or \n\n21 I checked with my lawyers and they told me the opposite. \n\n22 I mean, those are facts, and that\u0027s the thing that makes \n\n23 the statement in the registration statement itself \n\n24 misleading. \n\n25  MR. SHANMUGAM:

 Now, Mr.\n\nGoldstein made a somewhat different \n\n22 textual argument, and I want to address that, too, just\n\n23 to kind of lay all of our cards on the table.  He argued \n\n24

the affirmative defense, that this Court can somehow \n\n2 just import that concept into the affirmative falsity \n\n3 requirement. \n\n4  To me, that really illustrates why this is a \n\n5 profoundly atextual view, because in essence what he is \n\n6 saying is that, although Congress incorporated a \n\n7 reasonableness standard in certain specific contexts \n\n8

response to Ms. Saharsky\u0027s argument as to the text here. \n\n16 First of all, as I said in my opening, if Congress \n\n17 wanted to specifically impose liability in the absence \n\n18 of a reasonable basis, it certainly could have done so. \n\n19 There are statutes outside the securities context that \n\n20 use that phrase in order to impose liability. \n\n21

 But second, to the extent that the SEC views \n\n22 this as a massive problem, the SEC certainly could\n\n23 promulgate a rule under its authority under Section 19 \n\n24

we said in our reply brief.  We cite the verdict form as \n\n23 confirmation of that proposition. \n\n24  Third, I want to say just a word about the \n\n25 policy considerations here, pro and con a reasonable\n\n58\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 basis standard.  As I pointed out earlier, we believe \n\n2 that that standard is amorphous, and I don\u0027t think that \n\n3 anything that\u0027s taken place in the intervening half an \n\n4 hour has dispelled that proposition. \n\n5  Ms. Saharsky says that whether or not a \n\n6 basis is reasonable is whether or not the basis is one \n\n7 that would be expected under the circumstances, and I \n\n8 would respectfully submit that that really doesn\u0027t \n\n9 provide much more by way of clarity, and it certainly \n\n10 would make it very easy for a plaintiff to plead a claim \n\n11 under this legal standard because all they would \n\n12 presumably have to say is that the basis is not that \n\n13 that was expected under the circumstances. \n\n14  And as Mr. Goldstein said, this inquiry \n\n15 would be very context specific, and again in a context \n\n16 where issuers really require predictability and \n\n17 certainty, we believe that that is cold comfort. \n\n18  There is one other policy consideration, \n\n19 however, which I didn\u0027t mention earlier that I just want \n\n20 to mention very briefly.
