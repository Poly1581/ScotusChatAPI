 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear\n\n4 argument next in Case 13­7211, Jennings v. Stephens. \n\n5  Mr. Schaffer. \n\n6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. RANDOLPH SCHAFFER, JR. \n\n7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER \n\n8  MR. SCHAFFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it \n\n9 please the Court. \n\n10  Ninety years ago, this Court held in \n\n11 American Railway that an appellee need not cross­appeal \n\n12 to raise an argument in support of the judgment that \n\n13 does not seek to enlarge his rights.  Petitioner, who \n\n14 prevailed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim \n\n15 in the district court, did not have to cross­appeal here \n\n16 for two reasons. \n\n17  First, he did not seek more relief than the \n\n18 new punishment hearing granted to him in this ­­ in the \n\n19 judgment. \n\n20  Second, he raised an argument that the \n\n21 district court rejected as an alternate basis to affirm \n\n22 the judgment, and if he did not need to cross­appeal, he \n\n23 did not need a COA. \n\n24  We made ­­\n\n25  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I\u0027m sorry.  He ­­ I\n\n3\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 don\u0027t know if this is a new argument or a new issue. \n\n2 And the reason I raise that is when the judgment issued \n\n3 here by the district court, it specified two errors that \n\n4 had occurred and basically told the State court, fix \n\n5 those two or you have to release the defendant. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"1","file_name":"Jennings v.

What the Court does to analyze an IAC claim is \n\n12 to first isolate the errors of counsel.  It could be \n\n13 one; it could be a hundred.  It doesn\u0027t matter.  You \n\n14 accumulate them and consider them together to determine \n\n15 prejudice. \n\n16  If the deficiencies in performance \n\n17 constitute sufficient prejudice to undermine confidence \n\n18 in the verdict, then counsel was constitutionally \n\n19 ineffective, not because of A, B, C, or D, but because \n\n20 the totality of his representation did not meet the \n\n21 constitutional standard. \n\n22  So it\u0027s not a matter of fixing any \n\n23 particular error of counsel.  And that\u0027s where I believe \n\n24

issue or deny a COA when it enters a final order adverse \n\n13 to the applicant.\"  The applicant is the party taking \n\n14 the appeal. \n\n15  Here the district court did not enter a \n\n16

satisfy the showing of the denial of the Federal \n\n20 constitutional right. \n\n21  JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you agree that a \n\n22 petitioner who has to take a cross­appeal, because the \n\n23

The only question in this case now is whether the \n\n5 particular condition requested by this particular \n\n6 Petitioner was necessary or sufficient to add to the \n\n7 conditional release order, and we think that it was.  We \n\n8 think that this particular condition, the Spisak error, \n\n9 was a meaningful condition and it necessitated a \n\n10 cross­appeal for two reasons. \n\n11  First, if Petitioner had cross­appealed and \n\n12 prevailed on the Spisak claim, the State would have been \n\n13 obligated to fix that error, to cure that error upon \n\n14 pain of immediate release of the prisoner.  And that is \n\n15 a dramatically form ­­ dramatically expanded form of \n\n16

 MR. OLDHAM:  Well, this actually happens in \n\n21 ineffective assistance of counsel claims in other \n\n22 contexts where the State court has the power, for \n\n23 example, to conduct a colloquy with the defense lawyer \n\n24 to probe what the judgment is that has informed the \n\n25 defense lawyer\u0027s representation, what the defense lawyer\n\n31\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 has done, what the defense lawyer plans to do.  And, of \n\n2 course, the State has the ability to object and move for \n\n3 curative instructions if the error recurs. \n\n4  But the fundamental ­­ the really important \n\n5 point is that if the error recurs or if the State fails \n\n6 to fix it, the remedy is immediate release, which we \n\n7 should all agree is a dramatically expanded form of ­­\n\n8 of relief, which would necessitate a cross­appeal. \n\n9  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Oldham, some of my \n\n10 questions to ­­ to your opposing counsel suggest that \n\n11 ineffective assistance of counsel is mistake by mistake. \n\n12 That there are here three claims of ineffective \n\n13 assistance, not just one.  Maybe that\u0027s so. \n\n14  What do you do with this case where the ­­\n\n15 the trial court finds two instances of ineffective \n\n16 assistance, the State agrees that those two are valid. \n\n17 But appeals on the ground that it was harmless error, \n\n18 that the cumulative effect of those two mistakes was not \n\n19 enough to change the outcome of the trial. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"31","file_name":"Jennings v.
