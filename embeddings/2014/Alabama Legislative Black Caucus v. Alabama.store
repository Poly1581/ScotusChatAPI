 point in my remaining time going back to the question of \n\n5  what Section 5 retrogression required.  Mr. Chief \n\n6  Justice, you asked that question. \n\n7  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And when you do that, \n\n8  will you also tell us what effect, if any, the \n\n9  preclearance should have. \n\n10  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  So ­­ and the two \n\n11  are quite related.  I think Professor Pildes referred \n\n12  you to this chart, but the key thing is to look at not \n\n13  the difference between 2001 and the current plan, but \n\n14  the difference between the 1993 plan and the 2001 plan. \n\n15  The Justice Department cleared the 2001 plan \n\n16  that Alabama submitted, and you will see for every \n\n17  single district listed there, with maybe one exception, \n\n18  there were significant reductions in the minority \n\n19  percentages in those districts.  So Alabama knew \n\n20  perfectly well that it was completely consistent with \n\n21  its obligations under Section 5 to reduce the districts. \n\n22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You asked for a \n\n23  remand.  The result of the remand may well be Alabama \n\n24  has to redistrict; is that right? \n\n25  GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes. \n\n38","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"36","file_name":"Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v.

 MR.\n\nBRASHER:  I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a fair \n\n3  reading of either, Your Honor, and this is the reason\n\n4  why.  Certainly, with respect to specific districts \n\n5  here, when they were actually challenged, we were able \n\n6  to respond and say this was for partisan political \n\n7  reasons.  One of those districts, for example, was \n\n8  Senate District 11, which was specifically challenged by \n\n9  the Alabama Democratic Conference, and the district \n\n10  court held that the changes to that district were based \n\n11  on politics. \n\n12  Now, with respect to the plan as a whole, \n\n13  our response has always been that there is a lot of \n\n14  factors that went into drawing the plan as a whole and \n\n15  when it\u0027s drawing any specific district.  And I think \n\n16  it\u0027s important here that the Plaintiffs have never \n\n17  proposed a redistricting plan that actually meets our \n\n18

 reasons. \n\n22  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are you really saying that \n\n23  that\u0027s a pleading requirement, that they have to come in \n\n24  with a plan that meets all the rest of your criteria? \n\n25

Well, I disagree with you \n\n14  respectfully about it being a misunderstanding, because \n\n15  I think in 2006, Congress told us that we could not \n\n16

 are very few black representatives in this body.  I \n\n20  would like to find a way of drawing district lines so \n\n21  that we have a few more.  Okay? \n\n22

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You\u0027d look at the ­­ you\u0027d\n\n11  look at the complaint, when I look at the complaint, I \n\n12  suspect I\u0027ll find something about districts.  It\u0027s \n\n13  certainly true that, sort of taking the US point of \n\n14  view, the ­­ it\u0027s quite clear the ­­ to me anyway, that \n\n15  the court decided on the basis of a statewide plan.  So \n\n16  if it\u0027s wrong about that, then they ought to have a \n\n17  chance to go back and make their claim district by \n\n18  district and have a decision on that basis. \n\n19  MR. BRASHER:  Well ­­ and once again, I \n\n20  don\u0027t think ­­ they may have brought claims with respect \n\n21  to each individual district.  I don\u0027t think they do.  I \n\n22  think if you look at the complaint, you won\u0027t find that. \n\n23  But even if they did, the only evidence that \n\n24  they introduced about any of these districts are the \n\n25

 MR. PILDES:  Your Honor, the key fact we \n\n11  presented, I think, that hasn\u0027t been discussed here is \n\n12  that the Alabama Constitution prohibits the splitting of \n\n13  counties.  And they say they had a Supremacy Clause \n\n14  obligation to meet these racial targets, and that meant \n\n15  they could override the Alabama\u0027s ­­ the Alabama \n\n16  Constitution\u0027s protection of county boundaries and all \n\n17  other State traditional districting principles. \n\n18  And the 2 percent rule works the same way. \n\n19  If that\u0027s actually a Federal constitutional requirement, \n\n20  they can also override the key protections against \n\n21  partisan gerrymandering.  The very that few exist, the \n\n22  only hard constraints, the county boundaries are \n\n23  political subdivision boundaries, and it means they can \n\n24  manipulate the all­important county delegations in the \n\n25  Alabama legislature by breaking counties into multiple \n\n66\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  districts and then deciding who runs the county by\n\n2  putting their district in there. \n\n3  Now, a second question we answered that I \n\n4  think has been very important in this discussion ­­ and, \n\n5  by the way, I don\u0027t want to lose track of the fact that \n\n6  on remand, the Alabama legislature will have to comply \n\n7  with the whole county provisions, or at least they can\u0027t \n\n8  use this Federal excuse to split them. \n\n9  The way most States do this is they either \n\n10
