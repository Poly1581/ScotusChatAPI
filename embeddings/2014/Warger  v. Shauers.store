 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But ­­ but wasn\u0027t that a \n\n22 case in which a third party came and gave the \n\n23 information? \n\n24  MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct.  And so we \n\n25 are certainly not arguing that McDonough itself resolved\n\n3\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the question of the scope of Rule 606(b).  But we do \n\n2 think that the nature of the McDonough inquiry is really \n\n3 critical here in determining whether Rule 606(b) \n\n4 applies. \n\n5  And in particular we think that the critical \n\n6 fact is that McDonough in no way requires an inquiry \n\n7 into what actually took place in the jury room.  It is, \n\n8 as we say in the briefs, a type of structural error. \n\n9 And by that, I mean that it has no prejudice component. \n\n10  And in that regard it is critically \n\n11 different from other types of claims, such as a claim of \n\n12 outright jury bias, where prejudice is required.  And \n\n13 it\u0027s really for that reason that we think Rule 606(b) \n\n14 unambiguously permits evidence of this variety to be \n\n15 admitted. \n\n16  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the whole \n\n17 rationale behind this is we don\u0027t want to invade the \n\n18 jury province with information about what went on in the \n\n19 jury room.  And that\u0027s a pretty old rule.  And some \n\n20 people might think it makes no sense.

there is a concern raised about harassment of jurors, \n\n19 that is already dealt with, and appropriately so, by \n\n20 governing rules. \n\n21  Now, I think Justice Ginsburg\u0027s question ­­\n\n22

 the remedy on our McDonough claim a new trial.  And a \n\n8  component of that, once a verdict has been reached, is \n\n9  obviously that the verdict should be set aside. \n\n10  In other words, I\u0027m not disputing the \n\n11  proposition that our purpose here is to obtain a new \n\n12  trial, and of course, therefore, to set aside the \n\n13  verdict that has already been reached. \n\n14  My point is simply that a McDonough claim in \n\n15  no way turns on the manner in which the jury has reached \n\n16  the verdict. \n\n17

 question, is the verdict valid?  And the question, is \n\n21  the verdict valid, can have answers that refer either to \n\n22  the deliberative process itself or to the composition of \n\n23  the jury. \n\n24  MR. SHANMUGAM:  But that is not the question \n\n25  that a McDonough claim asks.  And I think the best \n\n14\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  evidence of that is that I think it\u0027s really undisputed \n\n2  that a McDonough claim can be brought even before a\n\n3

 the drafting history of Rule 606(b) is relevant, it \n\n21  tells us two things.  First, there\u0027s no indication that \n\n22  the framers of the rule intended to disturb what was the \n\n23  prevailing practice at common law, particularly after \n\n24  this Court\u0027s decision in Clark.  There is simply nothing \n\n25  in the history of the rule that suggests that.  And if \n\n19\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  anything, I think that the history of the rule suggests \n\n2  that the central focus in framing the rule was on\n\n3  excluding evidence concerning the manner in which the \n\n4  jury reached its verdict, and not evidence that was used \n\n5  to demonstrate that the jury was improperly constituted. \n\n6  Now, again, because the rule focuses on the \n\n7  inquiry mandated by the claim at issue, we think that \n\n8  ours is the better textual interpretation.  But at a \n\n9  minimum, if the Court thinks that the rule is somehow, \n\n10  by its terms, ambiguous, I would simply make two points. \n\n11  First, we do think that the canon of constitutional \n\n12  avoidance would apply in this context.  At least one \n\n13  court of appeals has held that there would be a \n\n14  constitutional problem with excluding evidence in cases \n\n15

 Justice, and may it please the Court: \n\n15  Any hearing on a motion for a new trial is \n\n16  an inquiry into the validity of a verdict.  That\u0027s true \n\n17  when a plaintiff ­­ when a litigant brings a McDonough \n\n18  claim because of what it ­­ the litigant is arguing is \n\n19  that verdict that was issued in his case is invalid \n\n20  because the tribunal that issued the verdict was \n\n21  improperly constituted.  It would be the same if the \n\n22  litigant were arguing that the judge that issued a \n\n23  decision in a case should have recused herself from the \n\n24  case based on some sort of conflict.  It would be the \n\n25  same if a litigant were arguing that the jury had 5 \n\n34\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  members or 25 members. \n\n2  In each of those examples, how the argument\n\n3  goes is that the ­­ the tribunal was improperly \n\n4  constituted and so the verdict that was issued was \n\n5  invalid because an improperly constituted tribunal \n\n6  cannot issue a valid verdict. \n\n7  Now, Mr. Shanmugam says that we should limit \n\n8  the phrase \"inquiry into the validity of a verdict\" to \n\n9  cases where what you\u0027re inquiring into is what happened \n\n10  in a jury room.

 verdict, I would just say one thing in response to what \n\n17  Ms. Harrington has just said.  If, for instance, a party \n\n18  files a motion for a new trial based on the \n\n19  insufficiency of the evidence, that is, by definition, a \n\n20  claim that can be brought only at the close of the \n\n21  evidence in the case. \n\n22  A McDonough claim is critically different \n\n23  because that claim ripens at the point at which the \n\n24  allegedly dishonest juror is actually empaneled.  And so \n\n25

 current state of the law.\n\nWe\u0027ve identified \n\n25  approximately 14 States where the evidence is \n\n42\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  admissible.  But this points out another point of \n\n2  confusion here.  Respondent and the government talk \n\n3  about this distinction between the Iowa rule and the\n\n4  Federal rule, and the Iowa rule applies to jurisdictions \n\n5  where only evidence of the jurors\u0027 thought processes is \n\n6  subject to exclusion and the Federal rule, like Rule \n\n7  606(b), covers a broader type of evidence. \n\n8  But even in jurisdictions that apply the \n\n9  Federal rule, courts have held that evidence of this \n\n10  variety is admissible.  And that\u0027s simply because we\u0027re \n\n11  talking about two separate questions:  On the one hand, \n\n12  the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion; and \n\n13  on the other hand, the type of inquiry during which such \n\n14  evidence is excluded. \n\n15  So again, we would respectfully submit that \n\n16  there is no evidence that this is anything other than a \n\n17  speculative concern that our interpretation would lead \n\n18  to these difficulties with juror harassment and \n\n19  undermining the finality of verdicts. \n\n20  Let me say just a word about the issue of \n\n21  racial bias.  I think this is critically different from \n\n22  a case involving, say, the application of the hearsay \n\n23  rule, because this really goes to the fundamental \n\n24  question of whether the factfinder itself was racially \n\n25  biased. \n\n43","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"44","file_name":"Warger  v.
