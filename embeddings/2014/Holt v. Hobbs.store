 This case involves the religious \n\n4 accommodation of 1/2­inch long beard that BOP in over 40 \n\n5 states would allow a prisoner to wear.  The State failed \n\n6

It really wasn\u0027t raised on this record.  My clients \n\n3 might think that it is, but based on the information I \n\n4 have, I would agree that sounds like that would be \n\n5 something that could be done. \n\n6  And I do think it\u0027s important to distinguish \n\n7 sort of the rule that I would propose and that\u0027s in the \n\n8 Couch case, and that is ­­ what I think is very similar \n\n9 to what the government\u0027s offering here, is really an \n\n10 effort to marry strict scrutiny with deference in a way \n\n11 that doesn\u0027t invite empiricism.  This Court\u0027s strict \n\n12 scrutiny jurisprudence hadn\u0027t always demanded examples, \n\n13 especially in the prison context.

We have a rule that says racially \n\n18 inflammatory literature of a religious nature that \n\n19 incites violence isn\u0027t allowed in the prison. \n\n20  And Justice Ginsburg in the footnote in the \n\n21 Cutter opinion seemed to think that of course that\u0027s a \n\n22 concern that prisons ought to be worried about.  That\u0027s \n\n23 not susceptible to any kind of empirical proof, I don\u0027t \n\n24 think. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"49","file_name":"Holt v.
