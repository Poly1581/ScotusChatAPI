 MR.\n\nGERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the reason \n\n16 why I don\u0027t think you should find that hard to believe\n\n17 is the following.  First of all, by going from \"by \n\n18 statute\" to \"by law,\" right, Congress went from a \n\n19 narrow ­­ a narrow structure that would have plainly \n\n20 foreclosed regs and instead moved to a much broader \n\n21 formulation that this Court had given meaning in \n\n22 Chrysler. \n\n23  Second ­­\n\n24  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One ­­ there was one view \n\n25 that by going to \"law\" rather than \"statute\" what was\n\n26\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 meant was to include judicial decisions. \n\n2  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, it does say \n\n3 that in the ­­ in the legislative history, but that\u0027s \n\n4 precisely why I think this Court should view that with \n\n5 some skepticism.  It\u0027s hard to believe that the term \"by \n\n6 statute\" would not have included constructions of \n\n7 statutes that this Court made.  And so to justify the \n\n8 move from \"by statute\" to \"by law\" to say we sweep in \n\n9 the Court\u0027s interpretation of statutes, I think, is a \n\n10 little hard to swallow. \n\n11  If I could reserve the balance of my time. \n\n12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. \n\n13  Mr. Katyal. \n\n14  ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL \n\n15

been talking about with Justice Breyer, is through the \n\n12 nonclassified SSI system.  The President can pick up the \n\n13 SSI system, in general, under the B­8 exemption because \n\n14

 And more to the point, this Court\u0027s decision\n\n7 in Eagan, which my friend cites, says that the \n\n8 classification regime is entirely a creature of the \n\n9 executive and can be modified at will.  So if they \n\n10 really believe that you need to do this and share even \n\n11 classified information with uncleared parties, they can \n\n12 do that. \n\n13

think the FOIA context is very different than here \n\n7 because FOIA is something about empowering agencies to \n\n8 restrict disclosures.  As this Court\u0027s decision in \n\n9 Robertson said, that that there was a preexisting \n\n10 legislative history about how they wanted to keep in \n\n11 place the 100 statutes or so that are anti­disclosure. \n\n12  The Whistleblower Act, I think, has the \n\n13 reverse idea in mind.  We see this texturally, for \n\n14 those ­­ for those who ­­ who are focused on the text, \n\n15

is saying by that phrase in the context of this statute \n\n19 is, unlike FOIA, we\u0027re not about trying to empower \n\n20 agencies through general language. \n\n21  And I think this is the most natural way to \n\n22 understand what the statute says.  I mean, I think \n\n23 when ­­ when ­­ when the word \"specific\" is used, I \n\n24

­­ Justice Kagan, you pointed out that the precedent \n\n7 seems to require that.  Justice Breyer, you pointed out \n\n8 that the legislative history in the Senate report seems \n\n9

 The principal practical arguments we\u0027ve\n\n55\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 heard today are that we don\u0027t have to worry because \n\n2 Congress could have had an executive order to make it \n\n3 work.  We continue to think there is no dispute that the \n\n4 SSI system doesn\u0027t work under Mr. Katyal\u0027s construction. \n\n5 The idea that what Congress expected was a duplicative \n\n6 executive order to mimic the SSI scheme seems very odd \n\n7 to us, and seems like a very odd way to construe \n\n8 congressional statutes. \n\n9  There was a concern here that there\u0027s this \n\n10 fox guarding the hen house.  That may be a concern with \n\n11 the Whistleblower Protection Act, but it has no \n\n12 application here, where Congress itself mandated the \n\n13 nondisclosure regulations, and did so knowing precisely \n\n14 what those regulations were when it did so. \n\n15  And finally, there\u0027s been some suggestion \n\n16 that the facts are in Mr. MacLean\u0027s favor here.  I would \n\n17 only say this.  What Mr. MacLean ­­ what a TSA employee \n\n18 has before them is not a full picture of the threats, is \n\n19 not a full picture of the resource constraints, is not a \n\n20 full picture of the other means that the agency is \n\n21 taking and is not possessed with the same experience \n\n22 that TSA has. \n\n23  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, I hate to \n\n24

How common it is to have \n\n4 regulations specifically mandated as opposed to \n\n5 authorized or permitted. \n\n6  MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we\u0027re not \n\n7

which generally says to the CIA director, protect \n\n11 sources and methods, and statutes like that. \n\n12  There are, of course, a wide range of \n\n13
