the party who doesn\u0027t.  And I think if you sort of play \n\n24 that out in terms of as a practical matter, particularly \n\n25

The second point of practice \n\n13 that I want to point out is this:  The 1997 collective \n\n14 bargaining agreement omitted all reference to retiree \n\n15 health benefits for people who had retired before \n\n16 January 1, 1996.  So beginning in \u002797 and in 2000 you \n\n17 have a collective bargaining agreement which says people \n\n18 who retire 1­1­96 and after will receive the following \n\n19 health benefit.  The record is undisputed that, even \n\n20 though the contract was silent beginning in 1997, the \n\n21

They\u0027ve obviously been renegotiated. \n\n14 For instance, the 95­point rule in this agreement was \n\n15 post­Yard­Man.  I mean, it was bargained to ­­\n\n16
