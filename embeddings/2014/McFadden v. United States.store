considerably the disagreement among the parties.  We now \n\n13 all agree that the Fourth Circuit misconstrued the mens \n\n14 rea element for a ­­ a criminal offense under the \n\n15 Controlled Substance Analogue Act, and we further agree \n\n16 that the jury instructions actually given in this case \n\n17 were erroneous. \n\n18  Instead, we and the government now agree \n\n19 that to prove an offense, the government must show that \n\n20 the defendant knowingly distributed an analogue.  And we \n\n21 further agree that the government may do that by showing \n\n22 that the defendant knew that the substance in question \n\n23 had the characteristics that made it an analogue under \n\n24 the statute. \n\n25

the Controlled Substances Act itself, we would agree, \n\n6 but the government would simply lose because, as it\u0027s \n\n7

 But then I don\u0027t know how broad the \n\n8 principle is that you just have to know what you\u0027re\n\n9 doing is ­­ would raise a doubt in the jury\u0027s mind about \n\n10 whether you knew it was legal or not. \n\n11  MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, so I ­­ I have two \n\n12 types of responses, which I\u0027ll just point out so that I \n\n13 can come back to them in case I don\u0027t get through them \n\n14 all.  The first is a doctrinal point.  And second, I can \n\n15 give you sort of a real world example of how this works \n\n16 in the CSA context. \n\n17  The doctrinal point is that this Court has \n\n18 held that there are other ways to prove knowledge other \n\n19 than that a defendant actually knew a critical fact. \n\n20 For example, the government can prove willful blindness. \n\n21 And the Court has explained, as recently as the \n\n22 Global­Tech case, that the reason you allow willful \n\n23 blindness to substitute for knowledge is not because \n\n24 being willfully blind to a fact is the same as knowing \n\n25 the fact.  It\u0027s because a person who is willfully blind\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\n1 to a fact has the same culpable state of mind as the \n\n2\n person who knows the fact. \n\n3\n
