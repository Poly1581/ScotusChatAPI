regulate a practice of a jurisdictional seller that \n\n17 directly affects the wholesale price for natural gas. \n\n18  Now, Justice Kagan, your example ­­ I think \n\n19 there might have been some confusion in the interchange. \n\n20 Your example is a practice that would directly affect \n\n21 the retail rate, not a jurisdictional rate.  And in that \n\n22 context, that would lie within the rate­setting \n\n23 authority of the State. \n\n24  But here we have something that is quite \n\n25 different.  We have juris­ ­­ indices for which the\n\n18\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 indices are based on both jurisdictional and retail \n\n2 trades.  Then those indices are used by common practice \n\n3 in the industry, and not just by these Petitioners, to \n\n4 set wholesale rates and retail rates.  That\u0027s done in \n\n5 advance. \n\n6  Particularly when we\u0027re talking about longer \n\n7 term contracts, the market participants end up often \n\n8 pegging their sale price based on the floating price \n\n9 that is reported in these indices.  And where you have \n\n10

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS \n\n15  MR. FISHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, \n\n16 and may it please the Court: \n\n17  This is an anti­trust case, and the \n\n18 plaintiffs claims here are very simple.  It\u0027s that they \n\n19 paid too much in retail transactions for natural gas \n\n20 because the defendants conspired to fix prices.  And \n\n21 this is important for two reasons, each of which \n\n22 independently saves the claims from preemption. \n\n23  First, because the state regulation here is \n\n24 retail ­­ is regulation of retail prices, it falls \n\n25 squarely within Section 1(b) reservation of power in the\n\n27\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Natural Gas Act.  And, secondly, the claims necessarily \n\n2 fall outside any field FERC could possibly regulate \n\n3 because, as my opponents have conceded, FERC has no \n\n4 power over antitrust ­­ it falls outside the agency\u0027s \n\n5 power under Otter Tail and California v. FPC. \n\n6  JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I\u0027m not sure.  It may \n\n7 be an exaggeration to say it ­­ it falls squarely within \n\n8 the exception given to the states.  This is not a state \n\n9 regulation of prices.  It\u0027s ­­ it\u0027s state regulation of \n\n10

of our claims is exactly what would be prohibited under \n\n13 the Federal antitrust laws. \n\n14  So under this Court\u0027s holdings in Ottertail \n\n15

First, the States have long \n\n18 been leaders in the development and enforcement of \n\n19 antitrust law.  Many of the State antitrust laws \n\n20 predated the Sherman Act, and they certainly predated \n\n21 the Natural Gas Act. \n\n22  Over the past century, State attorneys \n\n23 general have invoked State antitrust laws on a number of \n\n24 occasions to challenge anticompetitive practices in the \n\n25 natural gas industry.  The States urge the Court not to\n\n45\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 adopt an interpretation of the NGA that will foreclose \n\n2 the attorney generals from that traditional State role. \n\n3  The second interest the States have is an \n\n4 interest in maintaining the longstanding historical \n\n5 division of authority between the Federal and the State \n\n6 governments in this area.
