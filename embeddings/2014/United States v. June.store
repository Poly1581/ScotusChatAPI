that this time bar was jurisdictional and could not be \n\n3 tolled. \n\n4  Congress has made significant changes to the \n\n5 time bar four times:  In 1946, 1949, 1966 and 1988.  And \n\n6 at each of those times, Congress\u0027s words and actions \n\n7 were either inconsistent with or unnecessary in light of \n\n8 an equitable tolling doctrine. \n\n9  I could just tick through them.  In 1946, \n\n10 Congress enacted the FTCA time bar and expressly \n\n11 declined to include a tolling provision, even though it \n\n12 had considered earlier bills that did include that kind \n\n13 of tolling provision, which, as this Court has said, it \n\n14 was a deliberate choice, rather than an inadvertent \n\n15 omission. \n\n16  In 1949 Congress was aware that there had \n\n17 been individual cases of hardship and debated in one of \n\n18 the hearings whether to create a reasonable cause \n\n19 exception.  Instead of doing so, Congress decided to \n\n20 extend the deadline from 1 year to 2, which would have \n\n21 been unnecessary if equitable tolling could take care of \n\n22 the hardship. \n\n23  1966 is particularly important because at \n\n24 that point there were 2 decades of experience with the \n\n25 FTCA and every lower court to consider the issue had\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n11\n\nOfficial\n\n1

intending to benefit was not the plaintiff, not the \n\n9 injured plaintiff.  It was the Federal employee, because \n\n10 until Westfall v. Erwin, the Federal employee was off \n\n11 the hook.  He wasn\u0027t ­­ so then when this Court, said, \n\n12 Federal employee, you are going to be stuck, then \n\n13 Congress passed a relief measure for the Federal \n\n14

But Congress included \n\n18 Section 2679(d)(5), which was the provision that gave \n\n19 the claimant extra time to present a claim, 60 extra \n\n20 days, if the claimant was out of luck because the time \n\n21 of the statute had run by the time the United States was \n\n22 substituted as a defendant.  And that exception that \n\n23 Congress introduced in 1988 would have been entirely \n\n24 unnecessary if Congress thought that courts could take \n\n25

first decision holding that there could be equitable \n\n2 tolling in a suit against the government.  And so, by \n\n3 the time Congress enacted Title VII in 1970­­ in 1972, it was \n\n4

Federal Bankruptcy Act.  And this Court said that lower \n\n17 courts had interpreted the Bankruptcy Act to permit \n\n18 equitable tolling.  And so, the Court said that the \n\n19

it\u0027s not a particularly big deal to sue the United \n\n20 States in its own name for money damages, but when \n\n21 Congress enacted the statute in 1946 it was an \n\n22 incredibly big deal.  And, in fact, it took Congress two \n\n23 decades of debating this bill to even grow comfortable \n\n24 with the idea and to get everyone on board with waiving \n\n25 the sovereign immunity of the United States for tort\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\n1 actions. \n\n2  The Federal government was out ahead of the \n\n3 states in this.  The house report that accompanies the \n\n4 1946 legislation notes only four states that had waived \n\n5 their sovereign immunity for tort claims.  By 1969, it \n\n6 was only 17 states that had fully waived their sovereign \n\n7 immunity, only four of which, by the way, permitted any \n\n8 form of tolling. \n\n9  So I think it\u0027s pretty clear that when you \n\n10 look at the statute and you look at what Congress \n\n11 intended in 1946, those were the factors that motivated \n\n12 it, this was a strict condition on the waiver of \n\n13 sovereign immunity and Congress intended it to be \n\n14 interpreted narrowly. \n\n15  If there are no further questions I would \n\n16 like to reserve the remainder of my time. \n\n17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. \n\n18  Mr. Rosenkranz. \n\n19  ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ \n\n20

 MR.\n\nROSENKRANZ:  I am not, Justice Scalia.\n\n18 Let me just be clear.  Our position is from 1946 on, it \n\n19 has always been subject to equitable tolling, it has \n\n20 never been jurisdictional.  But to the extent that \n\n21 anyone doubts that ­­ because as Justice Alito points \n\n22 out, Congress wasn\u0027t thinking about any of this, so all \n\n23

So with respect to repeals by \n\n10 implication, what happens next is Congress makes it a \n\n11 requirement.  And the presumption then, or the \n\n12 Government\u0027s position then, as I understand it, is, when \n\n13 Congress turned it in ­­ turned it from permissive to a \n\n14 requirement, Congress also made that requirement both \n\n15
