equally\n\n7 crucial in Perales, Perales came under Section\n\n8 405(g) of the Social Security Act, the very\n\n9 same provision we have at issue here.\n\nAnd the question presented by the\n\n11 government in Perales to the Court was whether\n\n12 or not the medical expert testimony in that\n\n13 context could be substantial evidence.\n\n14 And I think what\u0027s important about\n\nPerales is that, in part 5 of the opinion,\n\n16 while certainly also discussing procedural due\n\n17 process issues, the Court in Perales gives\n\n18 indicia of why the testimony there had\n\n19 probative value and why it was reliable. And I\n\nthink it\u0027s very important to look at that case\n\n21 because, there, the medical experts didn\u0027t just\n\n22 give conclusions.\n\n23 What the Court noted specifically in\n\n24 Perales was that they laid out the tests that\n\nwere conducted, the results of those tests, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n23\n\nOfficial\n\n1 types of surgeries that were conducted, and the\n\n2 results after surgery.\n\n3 JUSTICE ALITO: But your reliance on\n\n4 that case raises the interesting question, a\n\nquestion I think is interesting, which is\n\n6 whether there would be any basis for limiting\n\n7 the rule that you\u0027re asking us to adopt to the\n\n8 specific situation here, which you have\n\n9 stressed where it\u0027s testimony, it\u0027s statistical\n\ntestimony by a vocational expert in a Social\n\n11 Security disability hearing.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"20","file_name":"Biestek v.

Why wouldn\u0027t the rule that you\u0027re\n\n13 asking us to adopt apply whenever there is the\n\n14 question if a determination by an agency is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence?\n\n16 MR. BHABHA: Well, Your Honor, I\n\n17 think, for sure, the term \"substantial\n\n18 evidence\" is one that applies throughout\n\n19 administrative law, but what this Court has\n\nmade clear in a number of cases is that, of\n\n21 course, substantial evidence looks at the\n\n22 record and, thus, inherent in the question --\n\n23 in the answer as to what \"substantial evidence\"\n\n24 means is, what is the question that the agency\n\nis trying to address?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n24\n\nOfficial\n\n1 In a situation like this, where you\u0027re\n\n2 talking about specific numbers that the agency\n\n3 is relying on as the sole basis to deny my\n\n4 client benefits for the applicable period,\n\nthere, I think, when the expert points to data\n\n6 sources that she has modified in order to come\n\n7 up with these numbers, there, substantial\n\n8 evidence requires more.\n\n9 But, in other situations, Your Honor,\n\nfor example, qualitative testimony, even\n\n11 testimony such as these are the kind of jobs in\n\n12 my experience I believe somebody with these\n\n13 sorts of limitations can do, i.e., the first\n\n14 part of what vocational experts testify, I\n\nthink that\u0027s entirely different.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"21","file_name":"Biestek v.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\n11 I\u0027d just like to respond to three\n\n12 things the government said.\n\n13 First and foremost, the government\u0027s\n\n14 lawyer represented that the Vocational Expert\u0027s\n\nHandbook simply requires them to bring public\n\n16 information they might perhaps rely on.\n\n17 I\u0027m sorry, but if you look at page 3\n\n18 of the handbook, it explicitly says at all\n\n19 hearings, you should be prepared to cite,\n\nexplain, and furnish any sources that you rely\n\n21 on to support your testimony. And what I take\n\n22 --\n\n23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what if, Mr.\n\n24 Bhabha, you\u0027re right about that, but, instead,\n\nit\u0027s just, well, that\u0027s the best practices\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n67\n\nOfficial\n\n1 rule. But the best practices rule is not\n\n2 necessarily a legal requirement.\n\n3 MR. BHABHA: I agree with you, Justice\n\n4 Kagan, but what I take from the government\u0027s\n\nown handbook is two things.\n\n6 Firstly, their administrability\n\n7 arguments are inconsistent with the policy the\n\n8 Social Security Administration itself is\n\n9 telling vocational experts. And on the\n\nspecific question of workability in the Seventh\n\n11 Circuit, I disagree with my friend from the\n\n12 SG\u0027s office that this isn\u0027t the rule that\u0027s\n\n13 being applied.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"62","file_name":"Biestek v.
