CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear\n\n4 argument next in Case 17-1104, Air and Liquid\n\nSystems versus DeVries.\n\n6 Mr. Dvoretzky.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n9 MR. DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\n11 Petitioners had no duty to warn about\n\n12 asbestos added to their equipment years or even\n\n13 decades after its sale. That follows from a\n\n14 well-established tort law principle:\n\nmanufacturers are not liable for injuries\n\n16 caused by third-party goods.\n\n17 That tort law principle --\n\n18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Their product would\n\n19 not be salable absent the addition of the\n\nasbestos insulation or whatever it is. They\u0027re\n\n21 making a product that is useless unless the\n\n22 asbestos is added. And doesn\u0027t that make a\n\n23 difference?\n\n24 MR. DVORETZKY: No, it doesn\u0027t,\n\nJustice Ginsburg.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n4\n\n1 First, the Navy -- the Respondent --\n\n2 the Petitioners, of course, knew that the Navy\n\n3 was going to use asbestos because the Navy\n\n4 determined that asbestos met its\n\nspecifications. That doesn\u0027t mean that the\n\n6 Petitioners\u0027 products were useless without\n\n7 asbestos. Today, those same products are used\n\n8 without asbestos on Navy ships.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Air \u0026amp; Liquid Systems Corp. v.

DVORETZKY: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\n4 Justice.\n\nI think that one of the challenges --\n\n6 one of the challenges of this argument is\n\n7 creating an administrable rule based on these\n\n8 terms like required, directed, inevitable.\n\n9 And I think the back and forth shows\n\nthat those terms, when you actually try to\n\n11 apply them, are very difficult to apply and\n\n12 will not lead to predictable rules that will\n\n13 tell manufacturers what they need to do and\n\n14 that will promote the interests of maritime\n\ncommerce.\n\n16 When you talk about the machine not\n\n17 operating without it, in our case, the machines\n\n18 would operate without asbestos. They just\n\n19 would not operate as efficiently.\n\nAnd Joint Appendix 104 and 128 discuss","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"61","file_name":"Air \u0026amp; Liquid Systems Corp. v.
