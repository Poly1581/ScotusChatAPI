CARVIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nWhile the Peace Cross should be upheld\n\nunder any sensible Establishment Clause\n\nanalysis, we submit the Court should analyze it\n\nunder the Town of Greece coercion test, which\n\nprohibits tangible interference with religious\n\nliberty, as well as proselytizing, for a number\n\nof reasons.\n\nWe think this is the simplest route.\n\nYou would simply extend Town of Greece rule for\n\nreligious speech to symbolic speech and it\n\nwould provide, in a situation where the chances\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n18\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfor coercion and proselytization are much less\n\nthan in the communal prayer --\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Carvin, could\n\nyou explain -- you have this coercion theory\n\nthat you think you\u0027re urging us to adopt.\n\nBut, if that\u0027s what the Establishment\n\nClause prohibits, only coercion, how does this\n\noffer -- how does this office differ from the\n\nFree Exercise Clause? That is, can you suggest\n\na practice that would be unconstitutionally\n\ncoercive under the Establishment Clause and yet\n\nbe inoffensive under the Free Exercise Clause?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"15","file_name":"American Legion v.

So we don\u0027t have a long\n\ntradition of that. It\u0027s sectarian. We have a\n\nlot of founding fathers, including George\n\nWashington, who was exceedingly careful to\n\nensure that references to God were as neutral\n\nas possible to as many religions as possible.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"29","file_name":"American Legion v.
