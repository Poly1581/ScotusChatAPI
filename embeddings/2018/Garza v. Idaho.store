ALI\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. ALI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\n11 In Flores-Ortega, a unanimous Court\n\n12 held that where -- excuse me -- a unanimous\n\n13 Court held where -- that where a defendant\n\n14 pleads guilty and instructs his trial counsel\n\nto notice an appeal, disregarding that\n\n16 instruction renders ineffective assistance in\n\n17 which prejudice is presumed.\n\n18 The Court reached that conclusion even\n\n19 though pleading guilty waives the vast majority\n\nof claims that could be raised on appeal and\n\n21 even though most defendants who plead guilty do\n\n22 not ultimately succeed in their direct appeal.\n\n23 The Court correctly concluded that\n\n24 prejudice is presumed, both because a\n\ndefendant\u0027s disregard for the instruction to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 notice of an appeal forfeits the entire direct\n\n2 appeal and because the attorney then usurps a\n\n3 fundamental decision that rests with the client\n\n4 alone.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ali, when you\n\n6 just described the relief that you seek, am I\n\n7 right that you -- what you\u0027re seeking is\n\n8 reinstatement of the right to appeal?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Garza v.

It said that a defendant may also\n\n4 expressly waive some claims in addition to\n\nthat.\n\n6 And the relevance that it recognizes,\n\n7 what we believe the relevance should be here,\n\n8 which is that the act of signing -- of pleading\n\n9 guilty and of signing an appeal waiver\n\nrepresents a -- a -- a -- a -- an indication of\n\n11 finality, an interest in finality on the part\n\n12 of the defendant. And that\u0027s why few\n\n13 defendants will plead guilty, sign an appeal\n\n14 waiver, and then instruct their attorney to\n\nappeal in the first place.\n\n16 And on top of that, in addition to\n\n17 acting as a -- an indication of finality on the\n\n18 part of the defendant, as the State and the\n\n19 United States acknowledge and, in fact,\n\nrepresent throughout their briefs, pleading\n\n21 guilty, signing an appeal waiver, and then\n\n22 having appellate counsel raise an issue that\n\n23 even might fall within the appeal waiver can\n\n24 have serious consequences for a defendant.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"14","file_name":"Garza v.

KEDEM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\n11 it please the Court:\n\n12 A prejudice inquiry under Strickland\n\n13 is the normal tool for identifying which final\n\n14 criminal judgments should be reopened based on\n\ncounsel\u0027s ineffective assistance.\n\n16 That is, cases where the harm to\n\n17 finality is justified by increased accuracy and\n\n18 reliability, the court should not abandon that\n\n19 case-specific inquiry here, where any benefits\n\nwould exist only in exceptional cases.\n\n21 A lot of the focus of argument today\n\n22 has been on the question whether counsel has an\n\n23 obligation to file a notice of appeal under\n\n24 various circumstances. That is the question of\n\ndeficient performance.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n56\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"51","file_name":"Garza v.
