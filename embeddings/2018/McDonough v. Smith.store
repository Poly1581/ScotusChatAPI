-- I just have one point.\n\nJustice\n\nGorsuch, you asked Mr. Wall why decide this\n\ncase when there\u0027s daylight between the\n\ngovernment and the Petitioner about whether the\n\ntermination requirement is a necessary element.\n\nAnd we think this Court should resolve\n\nthis because of the massive circuit split\n\nthat\u0027s outlined in the petition and leave open\n\nthe question of whether it\u0027s a mandatory\n\nelement.\n\nAnd we think so for two reasons. One\n\nof the policy concerns that the Chief Justice\n\npointed to, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Breyer,\n\nand Justice Kavanaugh, about not wanting to\n\nforce people to file during their criminal\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ntrial, and this is really important, as the\n\namici say, there\u0027s a rampant problem of\n\nfabrication of evidence.\n\nAnd as Justice Ginsburg says, that\u0027s\n\nthe kind of quintessential due process\n\nviolation this Court has recognized since\n\nMooney.\n\nAnd the second point, most notably,\n\ncontrary, Justice Gorsuch, to the premise of\n\nyour question, it\u0027s quite remarkable to\n\nactually have the federal government agreeing\n\nwith this former criminal defendant on this\n\nissue and saying the policy concerns -- as\n\nJustice Kavanaugh says, the orderly and\n\npractical policy concerns are ones that say\n\nthat a favorable termination rule, at least at\n\na minimum, should be imported as a limitations\n\nrule.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"53","file_name":"McDonough v.
