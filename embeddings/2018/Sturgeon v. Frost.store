FINDLEY: When it comes to\n\n3 interpreting the Organic Act, against Section\n\n4 103(c), those aren\u0027t necessarily implicated,\n\nalthough, as this Court recognized in the first\n\n6 decision, the state\u0027s power over its navigable\n\n7 waters does raise significant issues of state\n\n8 sovereignty. And any time this Court addresses\n\n9 a case of navigable waters, the refrain rings\n\nthroughout these cases that the state\u0027s\n\n11 ownership of the submerged lands and control\n\n12 and ownership of the resources within it is a\n\n13 hallmark of state -- state sovereignty and a\n\n14 hallmark of federalism.\n\nWhere the clear statement rule comes\n\n16 into play is the Park Service\u0027s fallback","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"8","file_name":"Sturgeon v.

What Congress said is you work\n\ntogether and create a management plan for each\n\n16 area, identify areas of concern on public and\n\n17 non-public land, and work with landowners and\n\n18 the State

BOTSTEIN: Your Honor, the\n\n17 reasoning of those decisions may be appropriate\n\n18 to -- for the limited purpose of effectuating\n\n19 Title 8 but should not be expanded to change\n\nthe federal reserved water rights doctrine\n\n21 throughout the circuit for all purposes.\n\n22 And, certainly, Congress had good\n\n23 reasons for treating Alaska differently than\n\n24 other states in the main body of the statute\n\nbecause this comes back to the Congress\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\n1 special solicitude for Alaska and its\n\n2 uniqueness, which are concerns this Court spoke\n\n3 about in its 2016 opinion.\n\n4 This is not a situation where we\u0027re\n\ntalking about tourists who might be disturbing\n\n6 a wilderness area. This is a situation where\n\n7 people are living and working along these\n\n8 rivers and using them for transportation, for\n\n9 commerce, for fishing.\n\nAnd these are exactly the reasons that\n\n11 states were given -- if -- if I may finish my\n\n12 sentence, Your Honor?\n\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"27","file_name":"Sturgeon v.
