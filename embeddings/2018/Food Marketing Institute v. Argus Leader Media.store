deviation of\n\nthe courts.\n\nBut, ultimately, all the circuits who\n\nhave addressed this issue have adopted the\n\nNational Parks standard and, as to the\n\ncompetitive harm requirement, all require a\n\nshowing of likely competitive harm.\n\nAnd that is the standard we\u0027re saying\n\nthat is -- has been ratified here.

Some of them say that when\n\nyou have the discretion, you have to withhold.\n\nSome say that when you have the discretion, you\n\nhave to withhold for five years. Some say when\n\nyou have discretion, you have to ask the\n\nprivate party their view.\n\nThose are all -- those all could have\n\nbeen codified under Exemption 4, but, instead,\n\nthey were codified under separate statutes.\n\nBut that\u0027s just a matter of formalism.
