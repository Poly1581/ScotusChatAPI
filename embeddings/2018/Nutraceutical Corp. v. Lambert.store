HUESTON: Justice Kagan, there is\n\nno doubt that if the motion for reconsideration\n\nis filed, for instance, on the 14th day, there\n\nwould then be a longer period of time. But we\n\nmust presume that the advisory committee\n\nconsidered that.\n\nAnd as I have thought about the\n\ntiming, the 14 days creates a shorter window at\n\nwhich then is hooked the potentially later\n\nmotion for reconsideration period.\n\nIf we apply Lambert\u0027s rule and extend\n\nthat out to 30 days or potentially longer, and\n\nin the Central District no deadline at all, it\n\ntruly renders the 14-day period a nullity in\n\nthat instance.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n8\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nYour Honors, I would like to direct\n\nyour attention particularly to the Carlisle","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"5","file_name":"Nutraceutical Corp. v.
