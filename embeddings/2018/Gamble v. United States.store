FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\n7 Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\n8 Throughout its history, this Court has\n\n9 correctly recognized that the distinct and\n\nseparate sovereign powers of the state and\n\n11 federal governments make state and federal\n\n12 crimes different offenses under the Double\n\n13 Jeopardy Clause.\n\n14 Petitioner provides no reason for this\n\nCourt suddenly to conclude that it\u0027s been wrong\n\n16 all this time. And overturning 170 years of\n\n17 precedent on this issue is going to invite a\n\n18 whole host of problems that this Court has thus\n\n19 far been able to avoid.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, 170\n\n21 years, I -- I -- I think your friend is right,\n\n22 isn\u0027t it, that we have not had a full\n\n23 consideration and exposition of the issue in\n\n24 any of our precedents?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"42","file_name":"Gamble v.

Federalism is usually invoked\n\n12 because it\u0027s a protection of the liberty of the\n\n13 individual, but, here, the party being\n\n14 strengthened is not the individual, it is the\n\nstate\u0027s freedom and the federal government\u0027s\n\n16 freedom to bring -- to prosecute with the same\n\n17 offense, felon in possession.\n\n18 MR. FEIGIN: So I think the Court\u0027s\n\n19 recognized in older cases, like Cruikshank,\n\nwhich was from the 19th Century, and in its\n\n21 recent first decision in Bond against United\n\n22 States that one of the things that American\n\n23 citizens get by being citizens of both the\n\n24 state and the United States is that there are\n\ntwo sovereigns that can positively legislate;\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial\n\n1 that is, pass affirmative legislation to\n\n2 protect them.\n\n3 So, in the civil rights era, when the\n\n4 states weren\u0027t affirmatively protecting the\n\ncivil rights of their citizens enough, they\u0027re\n\n6 also American citizens, and the United States\n\n7 stepped in to vindicate those interests.\n\n8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To -- to -- to\n\n9 state a different crime, not the garden-variety\n\nassault, murder.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"55","file_name":"Gamble v.

FEIGIN: So the tribes have\n\n6 limited jurisdiction as a consequence of\n\n7 federal law. Some tribes are allowed to do\n\n8 more serious offenses in exchange for providing\n\n9 more protections in their courts.\n\nVery few have decided they want to\n\n11 make that tradeoff because it would require\n\n12 them to dispense with some of the traditional\n\n13 accoutrements of tribal justice that are\n\n14 important to their traditions.\n\nSo, as the Court noted in United\n\n16 States against Wheeler, justice in tribal\n\n17 courts is more focused on restitution between\n\n18 the defendant and the victim and less focused\n\n19 on incarceration and deterrence and the kinds\n\nof treatment programs that they can receive in\n\n21 federal prison but that they\u0027re not going to be\n\n22 able to receive in tribal prison.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"62","file_name":"Gamble v.

HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, it\u0027s\n\ntrue that there are 20 states that have enacted\n\n11 a general sort of bar on their ability to bring\n\n12 a prosecution based on conduct that was already\n\n13 prosecuted by another sovereign.\n\n14 There are some quirks and differences\n\nwithin those states, but I think it\u0027s important\n\n16 to note that 14 of those 20 states are a part\n\n17 of our coalition today. They have signed on to\n\n18 our amicus brief urging this Court to leave\n\n19 that decision and those types of policy\n\nconsiderations to the states, which are already\n\n21 actively legislating in this area.\n\n22 Take the Commonwealth of Virginia, for","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"73","file_name":"Gamble v.

no easy matter to do that.\n\nThat\n\n16 problem would even be compounded if this Court\n\n17 were to declare a ruling for Petitioner to be\n\n18 retroactive. Anybody who had been convicted or\n\n19 even charged, really, a second time based on\n\nsimilar conduct would challenge that\n\n21 prosecution as unconstitutional under this\n\n22 Court\u0027s rule.\n\n23 And then, of course, a court in\n\n24 reviewing that, if -- if the rule were\n\nretroactive, would have to go back through\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n86\n\n1 history and apply Blockburger not just across\n\n2 the federal and state divide but also as a\n\n3 historical matter as to offenses that may have\n\n4 changed over time.\n\nFinally, setting all of these\n\n6 practical problems aside, I think it\u0027s\n\n7 important to note that Petitioner seeks to take\n\n8 us into uncharted waters. The -- the rule that\n\n9 he imagines has never been the rule in this\n\ncountry until potentially now.\n\n11 The states and the federal government\n\n12 have never had to be concerned about who goes\n\n13 first. Under the law of unintended\n\n14 consequences, surely, there are practical\n\nproblems that would arise from Petitioner\u0027s\n\n16 position that we may not have even thought\n\n17 about today.\n\n18 Unless there are further questions.\n\n19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\n21 MR.

It is the\n\n9 rule in at least 20 -- 20 states. It\u0027s the\n\nrule in 37 states with respect to certain\n\n11 crimes.
