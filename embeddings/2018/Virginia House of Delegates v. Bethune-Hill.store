In fact, under the Virginia\n\nconstitution, Article II, Section 6, it\u0027s clear\n\nthat legislators represent their current\n\ndistrict.\n\nSo there\u0027s no sense in which there\u0027s\n\nactually a divided constituency, unless we\u0027re\n\ntalking about a current legislator who\n\nrepresents one district and sort of has her\n\nmind on a future district in which she\u0027ll\n\ncampaign.\n\nI think the second point is that, to\n\nthe extent we\u0027re talking about just there may\n\nbe generally less responsiveness or concern\n\nabout this as a procedural matter, I do think\n\nthen we\u0027re pushing more toward the type of\n\ngeneralized grievance. It\u0027s not clear to me\n\nwhy the House as a body would have a particular\n\ninterest in that beyond what voters and people\n\nin the State of Virginia do.\n\nI -- I think another way to illustrate\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nwhy this isn\u0027t really a House-specific injury","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"27","file_name":"Virginia House of Delegates v.

far as I can tell, the very\n\nfirst time in this entire litigation that this\n\nHouse -- that, excuse me, that the House ever\n\nsuggested that they could represent the State\u0027s\n\ninterest was after we challenged their standing\n\nto appeal.\n\nAnd Karcher in part 2 of its opinion\n\nsays as clear as possibly can, you\u0027re not\n\nallowed to shift grounds when someone\n\nchallenges your standing to appeal. So I think\n\nthe Court does not need to get into that,\n\nJustice Alito.\n\nLet me go to the -- the question about\n\ndivided constituencies. There was a question\n\nabout that. I have two quick responses on\n\nthat.\n\nI don\u0027t think that can be a viable\n\ntheory of standing for two separate reasons.\n\nReason number one, if that were true, then this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Wittman was unanimously\n\nwrong because all three of the Congress members\n\nin Wittman could have said, as a result of this\n\nremedial map, I\u0027m going to represent a new\n\nconstituency.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n42\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd the Court did not say they had\n\nstanding on that theory. The Court never even\n\nentertained the idea they had standing on that\n\ntheory.\n\nReason number two, if you adopt that\n\ntheory of standing, it will have serious\n\nfederalism implications because you will be\n\ntaking away the states\u0027 ability to decide for\n\nthemselves.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"36","file_name":"Virginia House of Delegates v.
