BLATT: Justice Kagan, I would\n\nconcede that you have a reservation with any\n\ntribal power, not full tribal power or some\n\nfederal power that displaced state power, but\n\nhere it\u0027s a null set.\n\nIt\u0027s fine, there is no such\n\nreservation, but you could have a reservation\n\nwhere just the federal government can control\n\nnon-Indian-owned fee land.\n\nBut any -- I\u0027ll take any act of tribal\n\nsovereignty that the tribe could exercise over\n\nthe non-Indian-owned fee land and non-tribal\n\nmember, and they don\u0027t even have it over the\n\ntribal members because they had none.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Could I -­\n\ncould I just go to what I thought cession was\n\nabout -- Solem was about, which is about this\n\nidea of -- of cession.\n\nSo, as I understand the history, you\n\nhave this 1893 act and it establishes the Dawes\n\nCommission, and it very clearly says, look,\n\nthere are two alternatives here: You can\n\neither get cession of the land, or you can do\n\nallotment of the land and go figure it out.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"19","file_name":"Carpenter v.

GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nJustice Thomas\u0027s opinion in Parker\n\nfrom just three terms ago requires that the\n\nTenth Circuit decision be affirmed.\n\nParker confirmed that the text is what\n\ngoverns, and the text here is particularly\n\nclear.\n\nCongress considered hallmark language\n\nthat would have disestablished the reservation\n\nand Congress rejected it. So, in 1901,\n\nCongress initially sought cession, and when the\n\nCreeks refused to cede their land to the United\n\nStates, Congress instead enacted text that\n\ninstead went for only allotment.\n\nAnd in 1906, when Congressional\n\ninaction would have dissolved the tribe and\n\ndisestablished the reservation, Congress\n\ninstead enacted text that preserved the tribal\n\ngovernment for all purposes authorized by law,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"32","file_name":"Carpenter v.
