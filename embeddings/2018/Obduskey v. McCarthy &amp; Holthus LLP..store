It is an indirect attempt because the\n\nforeclosure process is designed by law to\n\nautomatically sell the consumer\u0027s house to\n\nobtain payment on the consumer\u0027s debt.\n\nThese conclusions follow directly from\n\nthe Act\u0027s plain text, structure, purpose, and\n\nhistory. Respondent can only resist these\n\nconclusions by rewriting the statutory text,\n\ncreating a huge loophole in the Act\u0027s scope,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nand eliminating the safeguards that Congress\n\ndesigned to protect consumers from debt\n\ncollector mistakes and abuse, which occur all\n\ntoo often in the foreclosure context.\n\nWe think that the easiest way to\n\nresolve this case is to focus directly on the\n\npre-foreclosure notices.

That\n\nargument fails for two fundamental reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it\u0027s not what the\n\nstatute says, and it\u0027s a highly unnatural way\n\nto read the text if that\u0027s what Congress is\n\ntrying to do.\n\nCongress used a well-understood,\n\nfamiliar term, \"enforcement of security\n\ninterests,\" which I think Petitioner concedes\n\nin his reply brief and this morning that that\n\ntext does not naturally track this subset of\n\nrepossession agents. So, if Congress were\n\nreally trying to do what Petitioner suggests,\n\nof just tacking on this small sliver of\n\nrepossession agents, it\u0027s a highly unnatural\n\nway to go about it.\n\nIf instead, as we submit, Congress was\n\ntrying to preserve the existing distinction\n\nbetween enforcing security interests and debt\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n59\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncollection and the practical difference between\n\nthose two -- because, when you enforce a\n\nsecurity interest, you\u0027re not asking the debtor\n\nto do anything -- if Congress was trying to\n\ntreat those two things separately, you would\n\nexpect it to write a statute along these lines.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"54","file_name":"Obduskey v.
