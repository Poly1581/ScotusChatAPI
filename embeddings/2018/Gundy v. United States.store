MS.\n\nBAUMGARTEL: That\u0027s not correct.\n\n19 So one important thing about this case is that\n\nevery -- every state had an existing sex\n\n21 offender registration system prior to SORNA\u0027s\n\n22 enactment, and those registration systems would\n\n23 remain in effect regardless of whether SORNA\n\n24 existed or not.

BAUMGARTEL: Well, as -- as this\n\nCourt held in Reynolds, the Congress left it to\n\n16 the Attorney General to determine whether SORNA\n\n17 would apply retroactively at all. And so\n\n18 Congress declined to make the initial decision\n\n19 as to whether any pre-Act offender should be\n\nrequired to register.

room would imagine, Rule 10b-5? I mean, Rule\n\n4 10b-5 is promulgated under a statute that says\n\nthe SEC can forbid the use of any manipulative\n\n6 device -- that\u0027s like the sex offender part --\n\n7 in contravention of such rules as are\n\n8 appropriate in the public interest.\n\n9 MS. BAUMGARTEL: So there are -- there\n\nare a few distinctions. One is that the SEC,\n\n11 obviously, is a different body than the\n\n12 Attorney General, and so this is a point where\n\n13 the Court\u0027s due process and delegation concerns\n\n14 converge. And it\u0027s important from the\n\nConstitution to have a separation between the\n\n16 body that is the regulatory lawmaker and the\n\n17 body that is the prosecutor.\n\n18 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it only the\n\n19 Attorney General who falls within the rule that\n\n-- falls within your argument?\n\n21 MS. BAUMGARTEL: That\u0027s something that\n\n22 exacerbates this delegation.\n\n23 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but -- but I\u0027m --\n\n24 look, the SEC has a rule such as we know,\n\n10b-5, the word is the public interest.

So, Your Honor, I --\n\n16 I agree 100 percent with you that this could be\n\n17 a statutory interpretation issue, but we would\n\n18 prevail under that.\n\n19 The problem with the government\u0027s\n\nstatutory interpretation argument is that the\n\n21 delegation provision here is not ambiguous. It\n\n22 gives plenary authority to the Attorney\n\n23 General. When the Court looks to, say, the\n\n24 statutory context or legislative history,\n\nthings to interpret that statute, that\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n13\n\n1 generally when the text itself is ambiguous and\n\n2 provides for two different plausible readings,\n\n3 but here that\u0027s not the situation.\n\n4 I just note Justice Scalia was\n\ndissenting, of course, in Reynolds because --\n\n6 JUSTICE KAGAN: He -- he was\n\n7 dissenting, but nine Justices in Reynolds all\n\n8 had the same view of this statute, which is\n\n9 that this statute demanded comprehensiveness in\n\nthe registration of pre-Act sex offenders.\n\n11 In other words, both in the majority\n\n12 and in the dissent, this was the one point in\n\n13 common, that they said this statute was\n\n14 designed for something and this statute did\n\nsomething, that it insisted that \"sex offender\"\n\n16 should be read broadly to include any\n\n17 individual who was convicted of a sex offense\n\n18 and that all those people should be registered,\n\n19 you know, with some feasibility recognition.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"10","file_name":"Gundy v.

Reynolds. It is an on/off switch to the\n\n3 Attorney General: Specify the applicability of\n\n4 the requirements -- it\u0027s pretty narrow language\n\n-- and do it in such a way as to get them in.\n\n6 I read it as the statute --\n\n7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now you\u0027re reading\n\n8 to get them in. That\u0027s --\n\n9 MR. WALL: Well --\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand\n\n11 Justice Gorsuch\u0027s point that you said he could\n\n12 turn it on and off as he decided.\n\n13 MR. WALL: Yes. That\u0027s the Attorney\n\n14 General\u0027s authority as a statutory matter.\n\nThat\u0027s what the statute means. I believe the\n\n16 statute means the same thing we said in\n\n17 Reynolds, though the Court disagrees in the\n\n18 default rule.\n\n19 The separate question is, is there\n\nguidance provided to the Attorney General in\n\n21 the statute on how he should exercise that\n\n22 on/off switch authority?

then requires all of the fleshing in.\n\n8 That, the Court has held, is permissible,\n\n9 provided you supply a general policy.\n\nBut it really is inside even that,\n\n11 because Congress set up a pretty reticulated\n\n12 scheme, made a lot of judgments along the way.\n\n13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that if\n\n14 there were a new attorney general who came in\n\nand said, you know, I think that this\n\n16 registration stuff has just gone overboard, and\n\n17 I\u0027m going to start making some exceptions with\n\n18 respect to pre-Act offenders, because I think\n\n19 it\u0027s just

the Court has proved exactly that.\n\n3 So I think the Court can set aside the\n\n4 tougher case than this one where Congress\n\nhasn\u0027t defined the elements of the offense and\n\n6 fixed the

And if that\u0027s\n\n21 right, there will be no federal duty to\n\n22 register in the 32 states that haven\u0027t\n\n23 substantially implemented.\n\n24 As a matter of federal law, more than\n\nhalf the country will be a sex offender\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n59\n\n1 registration-free zone.

evidence for this Court that to the extent\n\n17 feasible was not the standard of this\n\n18 delegation.\n\n19 That is not the standard that exists\n\nin the text. It is not the intelligible\n\n21 principle that was found by any circuit court\n\n22 to consider this issue. And it was not even\n\n23 the intelligible principle that the Attorney\n\n24 General himself said that he was acting\n\npursuant to when he issued his regulation.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n62\n\n1 In his final regulation, he said that\n\n2 Congress delegated to him, and I quote, \"the\n\n3 discretion to apply SORNA\u0027s requirements to sex\n\n4 offenders to the extent that he determines that\n\nthe public benefits of doing so outweigh any\n\n6 adverse costs.\"\n\n7 So the Attorney General believed that\n\n8 his discretion was to essentially undertake the\n\n9 fundamental policy determination as to whether\n\nthe costs outweigh the benefits. He did not\n\n11 view this as an issue of feasibility or\n\n12 practicality.\n\n13 Finally, I\u0027d just like to emphasize\n\n14 the special nature of this delegation. This is\n\nnot licensing. This is not civil rule-making.\n\n16 This is the retroactive application of criminal\n\n17 law penalties that affect individual liberty\n\n18 interests in the most profound way.\n\n19 This is the area where the\n\nConstitution specifies that there must be a\n\n21 division between the law-maker and between the\n\n22 executive.
