the Secretary\u0027s explanation for\n\nhis decision misstated the evidence in the\n\nrecord in three critical respects.\n\nFirst, the Secretary asserted that\n\nadding the question would maximize the

But the government has\n\nconceded that that was not true.\n\nAt page 32 of their brief, they\n\nacknowledge that, if the question is added, the\n\nnumber of people who can be matched to these\n\nadministrative records, the most accurate\n\ninformation that we have on citizenship, will\n\nfall by one million.\n\nSecond, the Secretary asserted that\n\nadding the question would improve the bureau\u0027s\n\nimputation of citizenship for people who lack\n\n-- for people for whom the government lacks any\n\nsuch records.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n67\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBut the government has conceded that\n\nthat was not true either.
