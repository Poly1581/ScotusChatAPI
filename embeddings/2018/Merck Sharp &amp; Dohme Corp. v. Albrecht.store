BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nRespondents\u0027 express theory is that\n\nthe FDA, fully informed of the risk of atypical\n\nfemoral fractures, ignored that risk and its\n\nown statutory and regulatory responsibilities\n\nbecause it didn\u0027t like the way Merck phrased\n\nits proposed warning.\n\nThat cannot be right. If a\n\nmanufacturer, as Merck did here, informs the\n\nFDA of a possible risk and unsuccessfully asks\n\nto revise its label in light of that risk, then\n\nfailure to warn claims based on that risk are\n\npreempted as a matter of law.\n\nThat rule follows from the statutory\n\nand regulatory framework governing the FDA\u0027s\n\nconduct and from the presumption of regularity.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nThe presumption of regularity, of course,\n\nassumes that federal agencies do their jobs\n\ncorrectly.\n\nThe FDA\u0027s job in this case includes\n\nprotecting the public health by working with\n\nmanufacturers to revise drug labels when\n\nnecessary.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dvoretzky, let me","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Merck Sharp \u0026amp; Dohme Corp. v.

The\n\ndistinguishing event was that they occur\n\nwithout external trauma.\n\nAnd so it\u0027s not a matter of something\n\nbeing a serious fracture or a stress fracture.\n\nThe term \"stress fracture\" encompasses both\n\nserious and relatively minor fractures. Again,\n\nFDA\u0027s concern ultimately was that practitioners\n\nwho were used to seeing the term in connection\n\nwith minor events might misconstrue it.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"19","file_name":"Merck Sharp \u0026amp; Dohme Corp. v.
