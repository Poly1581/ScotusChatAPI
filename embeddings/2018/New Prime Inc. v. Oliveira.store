The federal district court, I\n\nthink, had the power, inherent power, to stay\n\nor specifically -- order specific performance\n\nof an agreement, aside from the Federal\n\nArbitration Act.

And so, given these years of\n\nlabor unrest and the havoc that Congress had\n\nseen that people who are not common law\n\nservants could wreak, it makes perfect sense\n\nthat Congress would exempt workers based on\n\ntheir role in the transportation of goods, that\n\nis, their ability to shut down commerce, rather\n\nthan their technical employment status that was\n\nlisted in their contract.\n\nIt would make no sense at all for\n\nCongress to treat workers who had the same\n\nability to disrupt commerce differently simply\n\nbecause of what their contract said.\n\nAnd I want to note that if we take\n\nPrime\u0027s interpretation, that would also lead us\n\nto absurd results in at least two ways. First,\n\non Prime\u0027s interpretation, if a worker\u0027s\n\ncontract is silent, that is, if it doesn\u0027t say\n\nwhat your employment status is or not, then it\n\nwould be impossible to determine whether to\n\napply the contract at all.\n\nAnd, second, if a contract\n\nmisclassified a worker, illegally misclassified\n\na worker as an independent contractor, then the\n\nFAA, unlike any other federal statute, would\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n37\n\nOfficial\n\ndepend on that illegal misclassification,\n\nrather than the actual worker\u0027s status.\n\nAnd so we have the text of the\n\nstatute, the context of the statute, and the\n\nabsurd results that would result, all leading","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"31","file_name":"New Prime Inc. v.
