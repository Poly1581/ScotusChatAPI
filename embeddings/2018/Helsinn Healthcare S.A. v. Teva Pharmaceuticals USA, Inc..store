SHANMUGAM\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nIn the America Invents Act, Congress\n\ntransformed the nation\u0027s patent laws. As part\n\nof its shift from a first-to-invent to a\n\nfirst-to-file system, Congress revised the\n\ndefinition of \"prior art\" and clarified the\n\nproper understanding of the phrase \"on sale.\"\n\nThe on-sale bar, like the other bars\n\nin the definition, reaches only a disclosure\n\nthat makes the claimed invention available to\n\nthe public. That interpretation is consistent\n\nwith the plain text of the definition and its\n\nlegislative history. It\u0027s consistent with the\n\npredominant objective of the on-sale bar as\n\nrepeatedly articulated by this Court; namely,\n\nto preserve the public\u0027s access to inventions\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthat have entered the public domain.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it might\n\nnot be consistent with the actual meaning of\n\nthe word \"sale,\" though, right?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Helsinn Healthcare S.A. v.

-- and the House and Senate\n\nreports, the most definitive form of\n\nlegislative history, bear this out -- was to\n\nachieve two objectives: to make sure that they\n\nreached all forms of prior art,

JAY\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\nMR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nA product that is sold or offered for\n\ncommercial sale is on sale, as this Court has\n\nconsistently read that term.

That\u0027s events that make the invention\n\navailable to the public in other ways not\n\nalready covered by the statute.\n\nSo Helsinn\u0027s argument, as you heard\n\nthis morning, is that although it sold its\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ninvention, that sale did not place the\n\ninvention on sale.

think that the\n\nreason that the statute uses \"on sale\" and that\n\nthis Court has always read it this way,\n\nincluding in Pfaff, is to cover offers for\n\nsale.

And\n\noffers are important for two important reasons\n\n-- for two key reasons.\n\nOne, an offer shows -- the willingness\n\nto place the invention on sale, to make an\n\noffer to sell the product, shows that the\n\ninventor is ready to commercialize the\n\ninvention. And if they\u0027re ready to\n\ncommercialize the invention, and then the\n\nsecond half of the Pfaff test is met, the\n\ninvention itself is ready for patenting, then\n\nthe inventor ought to be going to the Patent\n\nOffice and applying for a patent.\n\nIf instead the inventor wants to\n\ncommercialize the invention, deriving profit\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n33\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfrom it, then the inventor can do that but\n\nshould not expect a legal monopoly that could\n\nextend past the statutory term.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think the most\n\nserious argument you have to deal with is the\n\nmeaning -- the plain meaning -- the fairly\n\nplain meaning of the new statutory language.\n\nSo you say \"on sale\" means on sale\n\npublicly or on sale privately, right?\n\nMR.
