It\n\nwould certainly -- it would be a different type\n\nof property right than any one that I\u0027ve seen.\n\nThere\u0027s the -- there was a discussion\n\nin this Court\u0027s Denver Area case about whether\n\nor not there was some kind of easement created\n\nin these public -- in the public -- in the\n\ncable system. And, you know, Justice Thomas,\n\nin his -- in his partial concurrence, argued\n\nthat there was no easement available for\n\nsomething like this. Easement is a concept\n\nthat\u0027s known in real property.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you can talk\n\nabout it as an easement or you can just talk\n\nabout it as a contract right, but -- but these\n\ncable operators would not be able to function\n\nunless the government had given them these\n\npublic rights-of-way.\n\nAnd in exchange for giving them these\n\npublic rights-of-way, the government says:\n\nWell, we\u0027re going to take certain stations and\n\nwe\u0027re going to decide what the programming for\n\nthose stations will be.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"11","file_name":"Manhattan Community Access Corp. v.

It has its\n\ndiscretion as to whether or not it wishes to\n\ncreate a public forum in a place.\n\nFor example, going to the theater\n\ncircumstance. When the government leases a\n\ntheater, it has a choice to make. It can\n\norganize the speech rules in that theater to\n\nmake it a public forum where anybody who wants\n\nto speak their message has the right to do so,\n\nor it can organize that theater and say: We,\n\nthe government, are going to decide who gets to\n\nspeak.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: If -- if the\n\ngovernment is running something and it allows\n\npeople to speak, it seems to me there -- there\n\nare two possibilities. One, it\u0027s throwing this\n\nopen for anybody to speak, but if it\u0027s not\n\ndoing that, then what happens there is\n\ngovernment speech.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nNow would you -- is this government\n\nspeech?\n\nMR.

But, within that\n\nlimitation, it was general access. Anybody\n\ncould seek to use that forum.\n\nIf, however, within that limitation\n\nthere is still additional discretion, then it\n\nbecomes a forum of selective access, for\n\nexample, like the debate circumstance in\n\nArkansas educational, because there was\n\nstill -- even if you qualified within the rules\n\nthat the -- the government established, there\n\nwas still additional discretion on top.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"49","file_name":"Manhattan Community Access Corp. v.
