Those exclusions would be\n\nsuperfluous if the term \"compensation\" only\n\n16 reached payments for periods of active service.\n\n17 As to precedent, since 1946, this\n\n18 Court has construed parallel language in the\n\n19 Social Security Act to reach all payments\n\narising out of the employer/employee\n\n21 relationship, including time lost.\n\n22 And, Justice Kavanaugh, to your\n\n23 question about whether that continues to be\n\n24 good law, this Court reaffirmed that precedent.\n\nIt applied it in Quality Stores just in 2014.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n20\n\nOfficial\n\n1 And those decisions support also\n\n2 construing the RRTA to reach time lost.\n\n3 And, third, this interpretation\n\n4 appropriately reflects the interlocking\n\nstructure of the RRTA and the parallel benefits\n\n6 statute known as the RRA. Time lost payments\n\n7 count as compensation under the RRA, and are\n\n8 credited towards an employee\u0027s retirement\n\n9 benefits.

Imagine the system as it\n\n14 was -- existed in 1937, where you had literally\n\nthousands of railmen who were retiring or\n\n16 unable to work and they were now all of a\n\n17 sudden getting benefits, but there were no tax\n\n18 revenues at that time that was sufficient to\n\n19 pay the benefits.\n\nSo there\u0027s always been an asymmetry\n\n21 between the taxing provision and the benefits\n\n22 provision.

The railroad\n\n17 asked for that instruction in the Liepelt case\n\n18 because it didn\u0027t want juries inflating awards\n\n19 because the jury would understand that if a --\n\na cache of money is being paid out to the\n\n21 worker, it would be subject to tax.
