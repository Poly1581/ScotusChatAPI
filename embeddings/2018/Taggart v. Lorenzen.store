GEYSER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\n11 According to the Ninth Circuit below,\n\n12 a creditor\u0027s subjective good faith belief\n\n13 categorically precludes any liability for\n\n14 discharge violations under the code. All sides\n\nto this case now agree that the Ninth Circuit\n\n16 was wrong.\n\n17 There is no per se rule that courts\n\n18 can never provide relief when a creditor\n\n19 violates the discharge in good faith. But\n\nRespondents and the government now propose\n\n21 adopting a different kind of per se rule.\n\n22 This categorical rule would adopt a\n\n23 profoundly atextual qualified-immunity-like\n\n24 defense for the code, declaring that courts can\n\nnever provide relief so long as a creditor can\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n4\n\n1 identify any fair, reasonable ground for\n\n2 violating the discharge.\n\n3 This novel proposal has no foothold in\n\n4 this Court\u0027s traditional principles for\n\nenforcing injunctions or the cords -- the\n\n6 code\u0027s broad equitable authority under Section\n\n7 105.\n\n8 There is no per se rule that excuses","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Taggart v.

SAHARSKY: Well, but the -- a -- a\n\n14 couple of -- I think there are a couple of\n\nanswers to that:\n\n16 First of all, I think there is the\n\n17 answer in terms of what Congress intended and\n\n18 then I think there\u0027s a policy answer.\n\n19 So in terms of what Congress intended,\n\nas we have discussed, Congress did not require\n\n21 advance determinations. It -- it anticipated\n\n22 that these questions would be litigated in\n\n23 collection actions.\n\n24 But then, second, Congress provided\n\nfor concurrent jurisdiction and it specifically\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n51\n\n1 recognized that sometimes there are questions\n\n2 about dischargeability of debts that depend on\n\n3 state law.\n\n4 And this is a point that the state\u0027s\n\namicus brief, I think, makes very well about\n\n6 how there can be state law questions about\n\n7 community property and other things that\n\n8 actually some of these exceptions to discharge\n\n9 aren\u0027t clear.\n\nBut just moving beyond that, because I\n\n11 think you\u0027re asking about the policy rationale\n\n12 behind this, I think we need to think about, if\n\n13 Congress were making a decision about this,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"47","file_name":"Taggart v.

If you looked\n\nat 362(k), it specifically says that courts can\n\n6 award actual damages, including attorneys\u0027\n\n7 fees, because they understood that this\n\n8 context, the fees constitute the actual harm.\n\n9 If you look to Rule 4007, this\n\ndefinitely will help debtors. This is an\n\n11 efficient, streamlined, economical proceeding\n\n12 before an expert bankruptcy judge. It imposes\n\n13 far fewer costs on the debtor than litigating\n\n14 in state court before state judges who aren\u0027t\n\nas familiar with these questions.\n\n16 My friend suggested that the\n\n17 Respondents in this case relied on a state\n\n18 court order saying they could collect fees.\n\n19 That\u0027s not true.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"60","file_name":"Taggart v.

In terms of balancing debtor and\n\ncreditor rights, Congress did balance debtor\n\n21 and creditor rights.\n\nThey did it in the code\n\n22 by creating 19 specific exceptions to the\n\n23 discharge,
