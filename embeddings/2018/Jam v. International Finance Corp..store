\"is\"\n\n9 is on our side of this case.\n\nBut, in Carcieri, which is the \"now\"\n\n11 case, the Indian case, the Court went out of\n\n12 its way in that opinion to say the insertion of\n\n13 the word \"now\" takes us out of the ordinary\n\n14 situation, which is when the referenced law\n\napplies at the time of suit. And so you can\n\n16 look at the Sutherland treatise, which dates\n\n17 back to 1904, on this principle.\n\n18 And look at its -- in -- in your own\n\n19 case, Justice Breyer, I think if I was going to\n\ngive you one case, it would be the Steamboat\n\n21 versus Chase case we cite in our reply brief.\n\n22 That\u0027s interpreting the Judiciary Act, which\n\n23 goes all the way back to the founding, of\n\n24 course, and says where the common law is\n\ncompetent to give a remedy, such and such a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial\n\n1 remedy is permissible.\n\n2 And in Steamboat, the Court rejected\n\n3 the exact argument the other side makes here,\n\n4 which is, first of all, that the law had to be\n\nincorporated at the time of suit and, second of\n\n6 all, that there was something different about\n\n7 the common law as to a statute at the time of\n\n8 the enactment.

They do\n\nthings like dispute resolution, law\n\n6 enforcement, Interpol. They do scientific\n\n7 research and agricultural research. All of\n\n8 those things are non-commercial activities on\n\n9 the other side.\n\nThen you have the category, the\n\n11 special category, of lending banks, but even\n\n12 within lending banks, not all the things that\n\n13 lending banks do are commercial activity.

and -- and that\u0027s essentially a\n\n12 roll-back authority of immunity.\n\n13 And -- doesn\u0027t that make a lot more\n\n14 sense, that provision, if you assume that\n\nCongress meant for there to be absolute\n\n16 immunity? In other words, the presidential\n\n17 authority is a one-way ratchet. The President\n\n18 can only under this provision roll it back. It\n\n19 can\u0027t increase it.\n\nSo, to me, if I -- if -- if -- if --\n\n21 if the immunity -- if the immunity is less than\n\n22 absolute, you would think that they would have\n\n23 given the presidential authority both ways.\n\n24 MR.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B.\n\nVERRILLI\n\n22 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\n23 MR.\n\nVERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\n24 Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe IOIA prescribes a standard of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\n1 virtual absolute immunity that is fixed and not\n\n2 evolving. We know that because the text\n\n3 incorporated common law terms that had a\n\n4 settled meaning of virtually absolute immunity\n\nand because a fixed standard makes the most\n\n6 sense in light of the statutory context and\n\n7 purpose.\n\n8 Now the reason that Congress enacted\n\n9 the IOIA was to fulfill treaty obligations that\n\ncommitted us to provide virtually absolute\n\n11 immunity. Those treaty obligations did not\n\n12 commit us to treat international organizations\n\n13 the same as foreign states were treated.

We think if the Court\n\n3 applies the normal rules of construction that\n\n4 it applies in statutory interpretation cases,\n\nthat Congress did say that it was providing\n\n6 virtually absolute immunity.\n\n7 And I think a case in particular that\n\n8 I would point the Court to is the Neder\n\n9 decision, 527 U.S., and in particular to page\n\n21 of the Neder decision. That\u0027s a case --\n\n11 that case, of course, was about whether mail\n\n12 fraud and wire fraud incorporated a materiality\n\n13 standard. This is an opinion by Chief Justice\n\n14 Rehnquist, unanimous for the Court on this\n\npoint. The Court said first we look to the\n\n16 text, of course, and when looking to the text,\n\n17 if we -- if -- and in looking to the text,\n\n18 based solely on a natural reading of the full\n\n19 text, materiality wouldn\u0027t be an element of the\n\nfraud statute.\n\n21 And then the Court says: But that\n\n22 does not end the inquiry because, in\n\n23 interpreting statutory language, there\u0027s a\n\n24 necessary second step.

Now what\u0027s going to happen?\n\nHere\u0027s\n\nwhat I think is going to happen, and I think\n\n11 this lawsuit helps you see it.\n\n12 Now the way -- the basis of this\n\n13 lawsuit is the following: the IFC, when it\n\n14 loans money here, it\u0027s loaning money in -- in\n\nparts of the world where private capital won\u0027t\n\n16 go unless we go in there.

I\u0027d like to\n\n23 make four points and I\u0027d like to start with the\n\n24 text of the statute itself and simply say when\n\nMr. Verrilli talks about the Neder Doctrine and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n65\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the Common Law Doctrine, that you look at the\n\n2 term -- a term\u0027s meaning at the time of\n\n3 enactment, he\u0027s mixing apples and oranges.\n\n4 And I think all the citations in our\n\nreply brief should make it absolutely clear\n\n6 that there\u0027s a doctrine on the one hand that\n\n7 talks about incorporating a body of law, and\n\n8 there\u0027s a doctrine on the other hand about\n\n9 giving meaning to a specific term. We\u0027re in\n\nthe former camp here.\n\n11 And as to the point about whether the\n\n12 common law was evolving at the time, two\n\n13 things.

stand on the papers as to the\n\n14 fact that it was somewhat in flux.\n\nBut the more important point is, even\n\n16 if it weren\u0027t in flux, it wouldn\u0027t matter one\n\n17 wit, because the other side is making a\n\n18 sweeping proposition, which is any general\n\n19 reference to tort -- common law is fixed in\n\ntime.\n\n21 That would disrupt any number of\n\n22 federal statutory regimes, from the Federal\n\n23 Tort Claims Act, enacted the year after this\n\n24 statute, the Equal Access to Justice Act, the\n\nfederal government\u0027s piracy statute, Federal\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n66\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Rule of Evidence 501. I could go on and on\n\n2 with federal statutory regimes that reference\n\n3 the common law in exactly the same way the\n\n4 statute does here.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866, if you\n\n6 want one more. All of those would come out the\n\n7 other way from this Court\u0027s jurisprudence and\n\n8 from all the understanding if the other side is\n\n9 right about statutory interpretation.\n\nSo I think the only thing the other\n\n11 side has is they have a bunch of policy points\n\n12 to make for this Court.\n\n13 Now we don\u0027t think they should\n\n14 control, but let me answer them. So first as\n\nto our treaty obligations. So one about at the\n\n16 moment of enactment.
