SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSection 365 of the Bankruptcy Code\n\nlets the trustee decide whether the estate will\n\nbecome a party to an executory contract of the\n\ndebtor. If so, the trustee assumes the\n\ncontract and the estate steps in to the\n\ndebtor\u0027s shoes. If not, the trustee rejects\n\nthe contract.\n\nThe statute\u0027s plain text tells us what\n\nthat means. Rejection constitutes a breach of\n\nsuch contract immediately before the date of\n\nthe filing of the petition. The debtor will\n\nnot fulfill any remaining unperformed\n\nobligations under the contract, and the\n\ncounterparty will have a prepetition claim\n\nagainst the debtor for any resulting damages.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBut that\u0027s all rejection is, the\n\nestate\u0027s decision not to take on the debtor\u0027s\n\nfuture performance obligations, which are\n\ntherefore breached.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus of courts\n\nand scholars is that rejection can\u0027t give the\n\nestate any greater rights with respect to the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v.

so I think really the right lesson\n\nto take away from (n) is the one Justice\n\nGinsburg was saying, which is that it doesn\u0027t\n\nput a thumb on the scale one way or the other.\n\nThey just didn\u0027t answer the trademark question.\n\nSometimes an omission is just an omission, as\n\nJudge Easterbrook put it.\n\nBut -- so then what you have to do is\n\njust resolve this by looking at the background\n\nrule under (a) and (g).

SPINELLI: Thank you. I have\n\nthree points that I\u0027ll try to make quickly.\n\nFirst, the Gorenstein case that\n\ncounsel referred to does not hold that a\n\ntrademark licensor can unilaterally terminate a\n\nlicense by ceasing to exercise quality control.\n\nThat was a case in which the licensee defaulted\n\non the agreement for other reasons and then\n\ntried to continue using the trademark\n\nafterwards. Obviously, that can\u0027t be done.\n\nSo there\u0027s no authority for the\n\nproposition that general contract principles\n\ndon\u0027t apply to trademark licenses.\n\nSecond, this is not about whether the\n\ndebtor can abandon the trademark and get rid of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n65\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nits monitoring obligations. It\u0027s about whether\n\nthe estate can take back the rights in the\n\nlicense and resell them to somebody else and\n\ndistribute the proceeds among creditors, and it\n\ncan\u0027t.\n\nRejection is not avoidance. There are\n\nseparate avoidance procedures in the code.\n\nRejection doesn\u0027t let the estate claw back\n\ninterests in the debtor\u0027s assets that the\n\ndebtor conveyed before bankruptcy.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you --\n\nMS.
