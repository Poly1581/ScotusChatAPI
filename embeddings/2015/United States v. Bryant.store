(10:15 a.m.)\n\n3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear argument\n\n4 first this morning in Case 15­420, United States v.\n\n5 Bryant.\n\n6 Ms. Prelogar.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MS. PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 Congress enacted Section 117 in response to\n\n12 the epidemic of domestic violence in Indian Country.\n\n13 The Ninth Circuit was wrong to strike down the statute\n\n14 as applied to offenders like Respondent who have abused\n\n15 and battered their intimate partners again and again,\n\n16 but whose tribal­court misdemeanor convictions were\n\n17 uncounseled and resulted in a sentence of imprisonment.\n\n18 The Ninth Circuit\u0027s constitutional analysis\n\n19 disconnects the validity of the underlying prior\n\n20 conviction from the permissibility of relying on those\n\n21 convictions to prove the defendant\u0027s recidivist status\n\n22 if he commits additional criminal conduct. And that\n\n23 runs counter to this Court\u0027s precedence.\n\n24 In Nichols v.

PRELOGAR: Well, that\u0027s absolutely the\n\n6 case. But I think, as this Court has recognized in a\n\n7 number of decisions in Nichols and in Daniels, although\n\n8 the stakes might be higher when the defendant commits\n\n9 additional criminal misconduct, and although that might\n\n10 mean that he\u0027s exposed to those more severe penalties,\n\n11 that there\u0027s nothing unfair in that process. And as\n\n12 well, there\u0027s nothing to suggest that those more severe\n\n13 penalties are being imposed for the prior acts.\n\n14 Rather, the Court has reasoned in a long\n\n15 line of precedents, that in those kind of recidivist\n\n16 situations, the penalty is a hundred percent for the\n\n17 most recent act of violence or for the most recent act\n\n18 of crime.

PRELOGAR: That\u0027s correct, yes.\n\n15 Actually, I think this is notable because I think it\n\n16 shows that Congress, in recent years, every time it\u0027s\n\n17 looked at how tribal courts are functioning and has made\n\n18 a determination about the rights and ­­ and what to\n\n19 recognize in those tribal­court proceedings, it\u0027s acted\n\n20 to recognize expanded authority for tribal courts, both\n\n21 with their sentencing authority, with respect to their\n\n22 jurisdiction.\n\n23 So I do think that that reflects legislative\n\n24 judgment that tribal courts are sufficiently protective\n\n25 of individual rights, and that there\u0027s no fundamental\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n           \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                        \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n            \n\n             \n\n               \n\n           \n\n               \n\n                        \n\n         \n\n                       \n\n              \n\n                     \n\n                       \n\n                           \n\n   \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n24\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 unfairness that\u0027s occurring in those proceedings that\n\n2 would cause, I think, this Court to question the\n\n3 reliability of those determinations.\n\n4 And I would point again to Respondent\u0027s\n\n5 concession that if he had simply been fined in tribal\n\n6 court and had not received a sentence of imprisonment,\n\n7 then there would be no problem with giving effect to\n\n8 those tribal­court convictions. That shows, I think,\n\n9 that Respondent\u0027s suggestion that there might be some\n\n10 kind of a reliability concern with this conviction is\n\n11 really unmoored from the constitutional analysis that\n\n12 he\u0027s asking the Court to adopt in this case.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"21","file_name":"United States v.

And the reason that\n\n17 we\u0027ve stated that, and we don\u0027t believe that does\n\n18 anything besides strengthen our argument in this case,\n\n19 because the reason why there is no violation of the\n\n20 Sixth Amendment is simply because the Sixth Amendment\n\n21 doesn\u0027t exist. If this case would have been in a State\n\n22 or Federal court, the only court in the United States in\n\n23 which it would not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment is\n\n24 tribal court.\n\n25 Mr. Bryant is not only a tribal member.

establishing an essential element.\n\n2 I do also believe that in taking a look at\n\n3 the difference between sentencing and the guilt phase,\n\n4 it\u0027s taken on a different trend in this Court when we\n\n5 take a look at the Apprendi line of cases. And\n\n6 certainly we know that there is an exception based upon\n\n7 a prior conviction, based upon Almendarez­Torres, but\n\n8 that premise is based upon, once again, that the\n\n9 procedural safeguards that we hold important in this\n\n10 country are adhered to.\n\n11 In those particular cases, specifically in\n\n12 Blakely, the reliance that a judge had to do wasn\u0027t\n\n13 enough. They essentially turned those element ­­ turned\n\n14 those situations into elements. And in this case, we\n\n15 don\u0027t have to do anything such as that. This is an\n\n16 element.

Nichols did\n\n11 include that language, but as I read the Court\u0027s opinion\n\n12 there, Nichols was actually drawing a contrast between\n\n13 trying to relitigate the underlying facts that led to\n\n14 that prior conviction versus relying on the prior\n\n15 conviction itself. And Nichols observed that a\n\n16 defendant is in some respects better on when you look at\n\n17 just the fact of the prior conviction because that\n\n18 conviction represents an adjudication of guilty beyond a\n\n19 reasonable doubt.\n\n20 Well, that\u0027s the same representation that\n\n21 the prior conviction has when it\u0027s used at the guilt\n\n22 stage.

Baldasar, where you would have a hybrid conviction that\n\n3 would be good for its own purposes and valid and\n\n4 constitutional in the original proceeding, but would\n\n5 lapse into unconstitutionality and become invalid when\n\n6 you tried to use it subsequently. The Court obviously\n\n7 overruled Baldasar and Nichols, and we\u0027d urge the Court\n\n8 not to return to that kind of hyperconviction.\n\n9 And finally, I don\u0027t understand Respondent\n\n10 himself to actually be adhering to this sentencing\n\n11 versus elements line, because again, he\u0027s conceded. If\n\n12 the tribal court had fined him, it would be perfectly\n\n13 fine to use those prior tribal court convictions as an\n\n14 element of the Section 117 offense.\n\n15 I\u0027d also like to respond to Respondent\u0027s\n\n16 suggestion that all uncounseled misdemeanor convictions\n\n17 are unreliable. I think that that\u0027s wholly at odds with\n\n18 the line this Court drew in Scott and Argersinger. It\n\n19 just cannot be the case that this Court was willing to\n\n20 interpret the Sixth Amendment to tolerate wholly\n\n21 unreliable convictions in that context. Rather, I think\n\n22 that the Scott­Argersinger line reflects that the\n\n23 assistance of counsel is not essential to an accurate\n\n24 and reliable determination of guilt in that context.\n\n25 And to the extent that that was left in any\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                     \n\n         \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n42\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"39","file_name":"United States v.

doubt, I think Nichols confirms the point. Because in\n\n2 Nichols, the argument was made that although those prior\n\n3 uncounseled convictions might have been sufficiently\n\n4 reliable when there was less at stake, they should not\n\n5 be relied upon in a subsequent proceeding where the\n\n6 stakes are much higher. But this Court wasn\u0027t persuaded\n\n7 by that, and I think rightly accepted the line that if\n\n8 the conviction was obtained in a proceeding that was\n\n9 sufficiently reliable to adjudicate the defendant\u0027s\n\n10 guilt in the first instance, then there is no way to say\n\n11 that that proceeding suddenly becomes fundamentally\n\n12 unfair and unreliable when you\u0027re giving effect to that\n\n13 valid, constitutional prior conviction subsequently.\n\n14 And then the final thing I would note is\n\n15 that although there\u0027s been a lot of talk about fairness\n\n16 here, I think it is important to recognize that\n\n17 Respondent had it entirely within his power to not have\n\n18 a Federal court consider these prior tribal court\n\n19 convictions.
