FINDLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n9 and may it please the Court:\n\n10 ANILCA was the result of a grand bargain.\n\n11 Congress enacted ANILCA to finally resolve land\n\n12 ownership in Alaska, a process that began with the\n\n13 Statehood Act and continued with the Native Claims\n\n14 Settlement Act, both statutes that granted land to the\n\n15 State and native corporations to further economic\n\n16 development and self­sufficiency for Alaska and its\n\n17 people.\n\n18 ANILCA very carefully balanced conservation\n\n19 with those important goals.\n\n20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. ­­ Mr. Findley, can I\n\n21 ask two quick clarifying questions just so I understand\n\n22 what\u0027s at issue here?\n\n23 Your argument applies to the navigable\n\n24 rivers generally; is that right?

I mean, Congress drops lots of words, but you\n\n18 put \"solely\" in a sentence when you mean \"solely.\" And\n\n19 this does not apply solely to public lands.\n\n20 MR.

This was the continuation in\n\n5 a trilogy of legislation that began with the Alaska\n\n6 Statehood Act and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement\n\n7 Act, and this piece of legislation furthered the goals\n\n8 of those predecessors.\n\n9 One purpose of the statute was to provide\n\n10 adequate opportunity for the satisfaction of the\n\n11 economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its\n\n12 people. And Congress explicitly balanced that goal with\n\n13 conservation goals and the goals of completing the land\n\n14 selections within the States. And that means that the\n\n15 National Park Service\u0027s authority in other States or in\n\n16 other parks are not the baseline here. The starting\n\n17 point is the power that Congress gave to the National\n\n18 Park Service and other Land Management agencies in\n\n19 regulating ANILCA parks.\n\n20 And what Congress did in Section 103(c) was\n\n21 to set aside the inholdings of the State, private, and\n\n22 native corporation lands that might be surrounded by the\n\n23 parks, but should not be regulated as though they were\n\n24 in fact part of the parks.\n\n25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: By \"inholdings,\" you\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n   \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n         \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                         \n\n             \n\n23\n\nOfficial\n\n1 include the submerged lands that were conveyed to the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"20","file_name":"Sturgeon v.

And our position is\n\n2 that the park ­­ the park management can\u0027t encompass\n\n3 State waters and lands.\n\n4 And there are good reasons that Congress\n\n5 made that choice. Alaska\u0027s waters are used in ways that\n\n6 are different from the lower 48 in, for example, the\n\n7 Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, there are three\n\n8 villages of less than one hundred people that are\n\n9 hundreds of miles from any road. And this is common in\n\n10 Alaska. So these rivers are the way that you would\n\n11 travel to get medical care or groceries or obtain school\n\n12 books for your children. And Alaska\u0027s ability to make\n\n13 choices about what sort of conduct is permissible on the\n\n14 rivers furthers its ability to provide economic and\n\n15 self­sufficiency for its people, which was one of\n\n16 Congress\u0027s primary goals in passing this legislation.\n\n17 The idea that the creation of a park somehow\n\n18 transforms Alaska\u0027s waters into Federal waters, Alaska\n\n19 lands into Federal lands without a clear statement would\n\n20 dramatically change Alaska\u0027s sovereign ability to\n\n21 control its property in a way that this Court never has\n\n22 sanctioned and should not do so now.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"26","file_name":"Sturgeon v.
