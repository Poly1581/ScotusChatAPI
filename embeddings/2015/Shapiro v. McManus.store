was certainly the\n\n17 case when the law was enacted that the three­judge court\n\n18 was viewed as an anti­plaintiff provision.\n\n19 The idea was that single judges were too\n\n20 quickly issuing

I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s\n\n23 still true today, but it certainly was when the law was\n\n24 passed.\n\n25 MR.
