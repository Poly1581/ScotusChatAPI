WAXMAN\n\n7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n8 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 Under Florida law, Timothy Hurst will go to\n\n11 his death despite the fact that a judge, not a jury,\n\n12 made the factual finding that rendered ­­ rendered him\n\n13 eligible for death. That violates the Sixth Amendment\n\n14 under Ring. In Florida, and Florida alone, what\n\n15 authorizes imposition of the death penalty is a finding\n\n16 of fact by the Court of an aggravating factor, a finding\n\n17 that the trial judge makes independently, and, quote,\n\n18 \"notwithstanding the jury\u0027s recommendation as to\n\n19 sentence.\"\n\n20 Now, the State here contends that capital\n\n21 sentencing juries make implicit findings that satisfy\n\n22 the Sixth Amendment under Ring, which the trial judge\n\n23 then simply ratifies. That is wrong.\n\n24 Whatever the jury\u0027s recommendation might\n\n25 imply about the specified aggravating factors, the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                           \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                            \n\n             \n\n          \n\n                         \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                             \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                           \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                        \n\n             \n\nOfficial\n\n4\n\n1 Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the notion\n\n2 that the jury\u0027s verdict is anything other than advisory.\n\n3 Florida law entrusts the factual findings of aggravators\n\n4 to the judge alone, who may do so on the basis of\n\n5 evidence that the jury never heard, and aggravators that\n\n6 the jury was never presented with.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Hurst v.

But once\n\n17 that\u0027s done, once the jury decides on an aggravating\n\n18 factor, the judge can do whatever she wants. The judge\n\n19 can add aggravating factors. The judge can reweigh the\n\n20 aggravating factors as compared with the mitigating\n\n21 evidence. The judge can do any of that stuff.\n\n22 But the judge has to leave alone the\n\n23 aggravating factor that the jury finds. So, in other\n\n24 words, the judge can\u0027t give death when the jury finds\n\n25 life, and the judge can\u0027t throw out the jury\u0027s factor.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                   \n\n              \n\n         \n\n                          \n\n               \n\n \n\n                 \n\n                               \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                \n\n             \n\n                        \n\n                    \n\n           \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n              \n\n            \n\n                 \n\n \n\n18\n\nOfficial\n\n1 But ­­ but as long as that jury makes that aggravating\n\n2 factor determination, the judge can do anything.

What Ring\n\n12 required was a jury determination on those facts on\n\n13 which the State legislature conditions the imposition of\n\n14 the death penalty.\n\n15 In this instance Mr. Hurst got that. The\n\n16 legislature has determined that the elements necessary\n\n17 to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty is\n\n18 the existence of a murder and one or more aggravating\n\n19 circumstances.\n\n20 And what the other side calls the advisory\n\n21 sentence included within it a finding, as this Court\n\n22 recognized in the United States v.

In that\n\n11 instance, the death eligibility was determined, not\n\n12 withstanding that he had ­­ he\u0027d been the decision\n\n13 maker, maybe would have decided differently. The person\n\n14 is eligible for death. And then it\u0027s up to the\n\n15 sentencer.\n\n16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I have to say that\n\n17 answer surprises me because the death sentence there is\n\n18 not at all a function of the jury\u0027s eligibility finding.\n\n19 The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and\n\n20 substituted his own, which then leads to the death\n\n21 sentence.\n\n22 So how can we say that that\u0027s possibly\n\n23 constitutional under Ring?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"32","file_name":"Hurst v.
