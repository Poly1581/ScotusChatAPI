And we\u0027ve looked\n\n6 at that, and it has.\n\n7 Secondly, with respect to diversity among\n\n8 particular majors, University does take holistic\n\n9 consideration of where ­­ which schools students are\n\n10 admitted to as well. So its policy addresses that\n\n11 concern as well.\n\n12 But what the record does show, Your Honor,\n\n13 conclusively, I think, is that diversity languished at\n\n14 the University of Texas in the period where we had\n\n15 race­blind holistic admissions plus the top 10 percent,\n\n16 and that the plan at issue here was necessary to\n\n17 supplement that.

GARRE: Well, I mean, I don\u0027t want to\n\n4 be result­oriented about this, Your Honor. But ­­ but I\n\n5 do think that ­­ that it\u0027s one thing to say in this\n\n6 record there are no triable facts, where the ­­ the\n\n7 courts below have gone that way. It\u0027s another thing to\n\n8 second­guess. And ­­ and the Court can. It\u0027s a summary\n\n9 judgment issue. But it\u0027s another thing, I think, to\n\n10 overstep the conclusions of the district court and the\n\n11 court of appeals here.\n\n12 And ­­ and I think it\u0027s particularly\n\n13 relevant here when it comes to the operation of the Top\n\n14 10 Percent Law. Our friends have challenged the fact\n\n15 that the Fifth Circuit discussed the way in which it\n\n16 operated, saying that that\u0027s outside the record. If it\n\n17 is, let us put all that evidence directly into the\n\n18 record. But they\u0027ve never disputed the way in which the\n\n19 Top 10 Percent Law operates.\n\n20 What ­­ what I\u0027d like to say too is, if this\n\n21 Court rules that University of Texas can\u0027t consider\n\n22 race, or if it rules that universities that consider\n\n23 race have to die a death of a thousand cuts for doing\n\n24 so, we know exactly what\u0027s going to happen.

this Court\n\n7 said previously in Fisher, and then I\u0027d like to make\n\n8 point about the process aspect of the narrow­tailoring\n\n9 inquiry in light of what this Court said in Fisher,\n\n10 which I believe Justice Kennedy will address your\n\n11 concerns about whether race is determinative here. And\n\n12 then I\u0027d like to move on to what I think this case comes\n\n13 down to, which is whether the University has made a\n\n14 sufficient showing of need to consider race in ­­ in its\n\n15 process.\n\n16 But before I make any of those points, Mr.\n\n17 Chief Justice, I ­­ I can provide some specific detail\n\n18 in response to the question you asked earlier related to\n\n19 the parents­involved point.\n\n20 Here are the numbers.

There wasn\u0027t\n\n6 a consistent trajectory in those numbers.\n\n7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there\u0027s an aspect of\n\n8 the holistic review process done at the University of\n\n9 Texas which may militate against the admission of\n\n10 African­American and Hispanic students for a ­­ an\n\n11 ostensibly race­neutral reason, and that is, that as I\n\n12 understand it, standardized test scores count pretty\n\n13 heavily in that process.\n\n14 One of the things the University says it\u0027s\n\n15 looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not\n\n16 in the top 10 percent of their class. And there are\n\n17 many who think that SAT scores and ACT scores are\n\n18 culturally biased. So if you put less emphasis on that,\n\n19 you might not have the numbers that you just recited.\n\n20 Well, it\u0027s rather strange that we ­­ we\n\n21 construct the process that may disadvantage\n\n22 African­American and Hispanic students for an ostensibly\n\n23 race­neutral reason. So then we have to add race in as\n\n24 a special factor to counteract that.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"70","file_name":"Fisher v.
