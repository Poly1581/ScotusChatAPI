Injury is the\n\n5 focus of Section 1964(c), and therefore, injury is\n\n6 limited to domestic application absent a clear\n\n7 indication to the contrary.\n\n8 That is a straightforward application of\n\n9 this Court\u0027s decision in Morrison, which says you\n\n10 identify the focus of the provision before you, and you\n\n11 limit it to domestic application unless Congress says\n\n12 otherwise.\n\n13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you\u0027re making a\n\n14 distinction between RICO when the government is using it\n\n15 as a prosecutorial tool ­­ tool, and RICO ­­\n\n16 MR. KATSAS: Yes. Yes. We are making a\n\n17 distinction between Section 1962, which is the\n\n18 underlying criminal prohibition, and Section 1964(c),\n\n19 which is the private civil right of action. Different\n\n20 provisions and statutes can have different foci, as\n\n21 Morrison itself made clear in separately analyzing\n\n22 Section 30 and Section 10(b) of the \u002734 Securities Act.\n\n23 And ­­ and here the difference between the\n\n24 substantive prohibition and the private right of action\n\n25 is clear from this Court\u0027s private right of action\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n             \n\n             \n\n               \n\n \n\n                        \n\n            \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                           \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                          \n\n           \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n5","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"2","file_name":"RJR Nabisco, Inc. v.

jurisprudence over the last 30 or 40 years which made\n\n2 clear that the decision to prohibit certain underlying\n\n3 conduct is fundamentally different from the decision to\n\n4 provide a private right of action for violation of\n\n5 substantive law.\n\n6 That\u0027s why Section 1964(c) has a different\n\n7 focus. You don\u0027t automatically assume that because\n\n8 Congress criminalized the conduct, it intended for the\n\n9 private right of action to follow along to the same\n\n10 extent.\n\n11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katsas, can I ask a\n\n12 question that ­­ this is an analytical question, not\n\n13 necessarily at all an argument that your result is\n\n14 wrong, but I ­­ I guess I\u0027m confused by what you said\n\n15 now and what you say in the briefs that this is a matter\n\n16 of looking to the focus of the statute, because my\n\n17 understanding of Morrison is that this whole focus\n\n18 inquiry came in at the second step of the analysis.\n\n19 In other words, once the Court had decided\n\n20 that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not\n\n21 been rebutted, then there was an additional argument\n\n22 that had been made like, oh, this really does involve\n\n23 domestic conduct. And so the Court used this focus test\n\n24 to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the\n\n25 extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                             \n\n                   \n\n              \n\n                \n\n               \n\n          \n\n                \n\n                      \n\n           \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n         \n\n                             \n\n               \n\n6\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"3","file_name":"RJR Nabisco, Inc. v.

incorporated into RICO, into the definition of\n\n5 racketeering activity, that have extraterritorial\n\n6 applications. Some of them have solely extraterritorial\n\n7 applications. And that is a clear indication that RICO\n\n8 itself extends extraterritorially to the extent that the\n\n9 predicates that are alleged in the case do. And that is\n\n10 true both of the pattern itself, the conduct of the\n\n11 crimes, and also of the enterprise. And you can see\n\n12 that, if you look at the kinds of predicates that we are\n\n13 talking about here.\n\n14 As was observed earlier, many of them were\n\n15 incorporated into RICO after 9/11. Many of them\n\n16 involved terrorist conduct. And the natural way in\n\n17 which the provisions would operate and Congress would\n\n18 have understood this is that they would have swept in\n\n19 activities by foreign enterprises as well as the foreign\n\n20 conduct itself. We\u0027ve given a number of examples of\n\n21 those kinds of provisions in our brief: The killing of\n\n22 the U.S. national abroad, taking U.S. hostages abroad,\n\n23 shooting at aircraft with U.S. citizens abroad with\n\n24 missile systems.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"18","file_name":"RJR Nabisco, Inc. v.

clear one, that is Section 2339D, which is\n\n2 receiving military­type training from a foreign\n\n3 terrorist organization. Although I suppose it is\n\n4 possible that somebody could go and receive that\n\n5 training in connection with their activities with a\n\n6 domestic enterprise, the very natural operation of that\n\n7 provision is going to be that they are going to be\n\n8 carrying out the affairs of a foreign enterprise ­­ in\n\n9 fact, a very foreign terrorist organization ­­ that is\n\n10 holding the military­type training and has those\n\n11 training camps.\n\n12 And so we think that it\u0027s clear that the\n\n13 provision has ­­ that Section 1962 has extraterritorial\n\n14 applicability, both with respect to the foreign pattern\n\n15 of conduct and with respect to the enterprise, to the\n\n16 extent that a predicate with extraterritorial\n\n17 applicability is implicated.\n\n18 I\u0027ve heard Petitioners talk about two\n\n19 reasons why they think that might not be true, both of\n\n20 which I think are incorrect. One is that the government\n\n21 could just prosecute the underlying crimes themselves\n\n22 and not use RICO, and the other is that ­­ well, in\n\n23 situations in which you have some people in the United\n\n24 States, you could kind of break them off and call them a\n\n25 domestic enterprise.

Section 1962.\n\n2 With respect to just prosecuting the\n\n3 underlying crimes, of course the very point of RICO was\n\n4 that Congress thought, where there were patterns of\n\n5 serious crimes, that just prosecuting the crime itself\n\n6 was not a strong enough tool for the government, and\n\n7 that it was important for the government to have these\n\n8 special advantages that RICO confirms in order to root\n\n9 out the things that are causing these patterns of\n\n10 crimes.\n\n11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But RICO imposes, it\n\n12 seems to me, as we\u0027ve even observed in the domestic\n\n13 context, far more significant ­­ the impact\n\n14 internationally could be far more significant than\n\n15 prosecution simply of the underlying offenses. It\n\n16 obviously provides the government with extremely strong\n\n17 prosecutorial reach and penalties, far beyond what the\n\n18 substantive elements do.

whether to bring a civil action, the government has the\n\n2 ability, it has the incentive, to take those kinds of\n\n3 concerns into account and to regulate itself, either to\n\n4 be constrained in bringing that kind of action where it\n\n5 might cause some comity concerns, or to deal\n\n6 government­to­government with another government, to try\n\n7 to make sure that those comity concerns are smoothed\n\n8 over. It\u0027s on the private side, under Section 1964(c),\n\n9 where you have private parties bringing treble damages\n\n10 actions, that the concerns about comity, I think, are\n\n11 much greater, because private parties don\u0027t have that\n\n12 same ability or incentive to regulate.
