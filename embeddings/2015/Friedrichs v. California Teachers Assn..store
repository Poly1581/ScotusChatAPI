JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, one of the points of\n\n2 your public employee cases generally, Mr. Carvin, is\n\n3 essentially to ensure that when the government acts as\n\n4 an employer, that the government be put in the same\n\n5 position as a private employer; in other words, that the\n\n6 various constraints that would constrain the government\n\n7 when it\u0027s acting as sovereign fall away and a different\n\n8 and lesser set of constraints apply that are meant\n\n9 essentially to ensure that the government doesn\u0027t use\n\n10 its position as leverage over things it oughtn\u0027t to be\n\n11 able to control, but that the government can do the same\n\n12 things that a private employer can.\n\n13 And so why doesn\u0027t this fall within that\n\n14 category of things? In other words, you\u0027ve just said\n\n15 private employer can decide to do this. That\u0027s not a\n\n16 constitutional problem. So too with the government\n\n17 employer.\n\n18 MR.

JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, it seems to me ­­ I\n\n8 guess we have one disagreement, which is how well Abood\n\n9 fits with all of our other employee speech cases,\n\n10 because I think Abood fits pretty well. It didn\u0027t cite\n\n11 Pickering, but it essentially had the exact same\n\n12 concerns as Pickering, which was the employer\u0027s\n\n13 interest, the ­­ the government\u0027s interest as an\n\n14 employer, and how that related to an employee\u0027s speech\n\n15 right and ­­ and basically arguing for a ­­ a balancing\n\n16 test.\n\n17 So ­­ so really what your argument comes\n\n18 down to is two very recent cases, which is Harris and\n\n19 Knox. And there you might say that Harris and Knox gave\n\n20 indications that the Court was not friendly to Abood.\n\n21 But those were two extremely recent cases, and they were\n\n22 both cases that actually were decided within the Abood\n\n23 framework.\n\n24 In the Harris case, the parties came here\n\n25 and explicitly asked us to overrule that case.

They might have supported the rival\n\n14 unions. They might be in favor of unionism, but they\n\n15 supported a different one.

Because they certainly ­­ it\u0027s\n\n15 their burden to argue, for example, that agency fees\n\n16 will lead to the demise of the union. But they didn\u0027t\n\n17 make any such allegation in their answer.
