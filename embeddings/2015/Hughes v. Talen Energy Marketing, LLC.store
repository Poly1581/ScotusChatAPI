STRAUSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n11 please the Court:\n\n12 Maryland determined that new generation was\n\n13 needed for local reliability, so it directed its retail\n\n14 utilities to sign 20­year contracts with a competitively\n\n15 selected project developer.\n\n16 Maryland\u0027s action did not intrude on Federal\n\n17 authority, primarily for two reasons.\n\n18 The first reason is that Maryland\u0027s new\n\n19 resource did not distort the wholesale capacity auction.\n\n20 FERC revised its auction bidding rules to require the\n\n21 Maryland resource to bid on the basis of its cost,\n\n22 backing out any State contract revenue. The developer\n\n23 bid in accordance with the rules and cleared the\n\n24 auction.\n\n25 FERC says that means that the resource is\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n           \n\n       \n\n                    \n\n                         \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                       \n\n                  \n\n \n\n                           \n\n             \n\n \n\n                            \n\n                     \n\n                  \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n                      \n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\n1 economic, needed, competitive, and does not suppress\n\n2 prices, any State revenue notwithstanding.\n\n3 The second reason is ­­\n\n4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it doesn\u0027t\n\n5 suppress prices, why did Maryland do it?\n\n6 MR. STRAUSS: Maryland did it, Your Honor,\n\n7 because they saw a need for generation going forward.\n\n8 As is clear in the generation order, Maryland perceived\n\n9 a problem.

in PJM, and when under that auction, PJM procures three\n\n15 years in advance for a one­year period all the capacity\n\n16 the region needs, and then it allocates the cost of that\n\n17 capacity among all the utilities. But it tells the\n\n18 utilities that you have a way to hedge against those\n\n19 costs. If you have long­term resources, resources that\n\n20 you bought or procured through contract, you can bid\n\n21 them in, and if they clear, they will offset the cost.\n\n22 Maryland\u0027s concern was this: It wanted and\n\n23 needed the resource, but it was concerned that the\n\n24 resource clear so that it hedge against the cost and\n\n25 customers not pay twice for the same resource.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                              \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                           \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n       \n\n                      \n\n              \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n                \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                    \n\n           \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                          \n\n                           \n\n               \n\nOfficial\n\n7\n\n1 So in order to do that, it entered into the\n\n2 contract for differences.

MR.\n\nSTRAUSS: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nThe auction\n\n4 dynamic allows for parties, and indeed encourages\n\n5 parties, to enter into long­term contracts for capacity\n\n6 resources and bid them into the auction. But they can\u0027t\n\n7 clear the auction. They don\u0027t become auction resources\n\n8 unless they are able to do so. And in this case, FERC\n\n9 had in front of it exactly what Maryland and a related\n\n10 program in New Jersey were about at the time they\n\n11 revised the rules.\n\n12 What FERC sought to do was to reconcile the\n\n13 issue of the State programs and how they would interact\n\n14 with the auction, and FERC did that. It set a different\n\n15 bidding process, and Maryland followed that bidding\n\n16 process. The CPV resource bid in accordance with it and\n\n17 cleared on that basis.\n\n18 JUSTICE ALITO: But the ­­ as originally set\n\n19 up, CPV had no incentive to ­­ to bid anything other\n\n20 than zero; isn\u0027t that right? All it was interested in\n\n21 was clearing the market.\n\n22 MR. STRAUSS: That is ­­ that is correct.\n\n23 JUSTICE ALITO: And that affects the dynamic\n\n24 of the ­­ of the PJM auction, does it not?\n\n25 MR. STRAUSS: Yes.

that were being built\n\n5 for reliability, which is exactly what this resource is,\n\n6 could bid in at zero, a zero price, and clear\n\n7 automatically in order to ensure that States could meet\n\n8 their responsibilities to ensure of a liability.\n\n9 In 2011, when FERC became aware of the\n\n10 Maryland and New Jersey programs, it revised the rules.\n\n11 But it didn\u0027t prohibit those resources; it didn\u0027t\n\n12 preclude them. It changed the rules so that they could\n\n13 continue to bid, but they had to bid on a cost basis.\n\n14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But ­­ but I have to say\n\n15 that they also looked at a long­term contract ­­ FERC\n\n16 did, and PJM ­­ in the PJM Interconnection order, and it\n\n17 determined that a seven­year lock­in period for a new\n\n18 generator was unfair, unjust and unreasonable.

FERC\n\n22 disagrees, because you have no incentive to bid anything\n\n23 other than zero.

But I guess I ­­ I\u0027ll repeat the question that I made\n\n14 to ­­ to Mr. Strauss.\n\n15 I mean, we know that one of the ways that\n\n16 you pick a price is by letting an auction determine that\n\n17 price. That\u0027s exactly what FERC does.\n\n18 MR. ELGARTEN: We ­­ we had a competitive\n\n19 bid to bid ­­ build a power plant. That\u0027s what was set\n\n20 up here. We were talking ­­ in answering your first\n\n21 question, I was answering the conceptual question of\n\n22 what it is FERC regulates.

you said, the starting\n\n21 premise here is the statute gives FERC the authority to\n\n22 determine whether wholesale rates are just and\n\n23 reasonable. FERC has done that effectively ex ante with\n\n24 respect to the PJM markets by its regulations of PJM.\n\n25 FERC has said that the auction clearing rate for sales\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n         \n\n                          \n\n                     \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                           \n\n              \n\n              \n\n                    \n\n                       \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n       \n\n                            \n\n                    \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\n1 to PJM is just and reasonable.\n\n2 Now, the authority of FERC extends not just\n\n3 to what the nominal rate is in the auction but to what\n\n4 the supplier receives in connection with that sale. So\n\n5 if a State, through State action, says, it\u0027s all very\n\n6 well CPV that you\u0027ve sold that to PJM and PJM has given\n\n7 you a hundred, this is your lucky day, we\u0027re going to\n\n8 give you another 50, that is clearly preempted because a\n\n9 State is having the supplier receive something in\n\n10 connection with a wholesale sale to PJM that is\n\n11 different from the rate that FERC has determined is\n\n12 reasonable.\n\n13 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me try that with the\n\n14 example. Five thousand new megawatts of capacity is\n\n15 needed. Existing suppliers can\u0027t supply more than four.\n\n16 So FERC is trying to get an extra thousand.

Fair enough.\n\nProbably not arbitrary and capricious, but\n\n4 it doesn\u0027t mean that this is something that the MOPR is\n\n5 some perfect solution.\n\n6 I also don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything terribly\n\n7 anomalous about the procedural posture of this case. I\n\n8 think it\u0027s exact procedural posture you had in front of\n\n9 you in the Schneidewind case. That was a district court\n\n10 action, declaratory judgment for preemption.\n\n11 What I think makes this a preemption case,\n\n12 and what completely distinguishes voluntary bilateral\n\n13 contracts, is State action. It\u0027s the State action\n\n14 forcing the LSCs to make these payments, and essentially\n\n15 conditioning CPV\u0027s participation on the PJM market on\n\n16 the bid­and­clear requirement. That\u0027s State action\n\n17 that\u0027s preempted.\n\n18 In the typical voluntary bilateral contract,\n\n19 you don\u0027t have State action. The parties make their\n\n20 agreement.

gets to review\n\n4 those rates, and States get to direct the procurement\n\n5 decisions of their retail utilities.\n\n6 Been a lot of talk here about what the\n\n7 retail utilities were forced to do.

States can take\n\n11 actions where necessary to develop new power plants.\n\n12 And as we move forward into an era of a new\n\n13 generation portfolio in this country, the last thing the\n\n14 Court should be considering is trying to limit State\n\n15 options. It\u0027s very important to keep them open,\n\n16 especially in a case here, where FERC has reviewed this\n\n17 precise contract.\n\n18 If you look on page 6 of our reply brief,\n\n19 there is a quote from the FERC rehearing order in\n\n20 November of 2011 in which FERC describes an acceptable\n\n21 arrangement and describes this arrangement: one in\n\n22 which local utilities contract with a generator and the\n\n23 generator bids the unit into the market.\n\n24 That is exactly what happened under this\n\n25 contract.
