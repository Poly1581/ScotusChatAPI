BEENEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 I\u0027d like to begin this morning with why the\n\n11 use of the broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient\n\n12 in no way comports with the congressional purpose of\n\n13 inter partes review, and then address why the Board\u0027s\n\n14 ultra vires determination in instituting inter partes\n\n15 review is subject to judicial review.\n\n16 Consistent with history, Congress left to\n\n17 the judiciary to determine construction standards, and\n\n18 therefore, in the American Invents Act, there is no\n\n19 explicit statutory language directing the Patent and\n\n20 Trademark Office to use any particular standard of claim\n\n21 construction.\n\n22 But this Court should reverse, as a matter\n\n23 of statutory construction, for four reasons. First, in\n\n24 summary, all agree that the\n\n25 broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient demands a\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n           \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n         \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n             \n\n            \n\n                  \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n                \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n           \n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n4\n\n1 broad ability to amend claims, and that\u0027s so because the\n\n2 broadest reasonable interpretation brings into play a","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v.

What the PTO said to the court was that, in fact, there\n\n3 is this very profound distinction between the right to\n\n4 make a motion to amend in an adjudicatory context and\n\n5 the ability to amend patents in the examinational\n\n6 context where there is an iterative, back­and­forth,\n\n7 generally cooperative process between the examiner and\n\n8 the patentee.\n\n9 That is diametrically different to the\n\n10 system that Congress established in inter partes review,\n\n11 as the Patent and Trademark Office represented to the\n\n12 district court.\n\n13 And going back to the statistics that I was\n\n14 citing in response to Justice Sotomayor\u0027s original\n\n15 question, 95 percent of the motions to amend in inter\n\n16 partes review are denied. Less than 30 claims have been\n\n17 amended, while 10,000 have been canceled. And there is\n\n18 simply not the kind of ability that is necessary in\n\n19 order to avoid the prejudice to the patentee of giving\n\n20 her claims a construction broader than what they\n\n21 actually are that\u0027s afforded in inter partes review.\n\n22 JUSTICE ALITO: Do the Board\u0027s institution\n\n23 decisions always set out what it understands the\n\n24 broadest reasonable interpretation to be?

BEENEY: The ­­ IPR proceeds in two\n\n5 separate stages, as ­­ as your question implicates,\n\n6 Justice Alito. First, there is the institution\n\n7 decision. In there, the Board typically does set forth\n\n8 a preliminary­claim­interpretation standard. But for\n\n9 the government to take the position that that\u0027s the end\n\n10 of the ballgame is wholly inconsistent with its position\n\n11 on the second question presented about appeal.\n\n12 Obviously, the claim­construction interpretation is\n\n13 subject to appeal, and so it can\u0027t be fixed in the\n\n14 institution determination.\n\n15 The final claim­construction standard that\n\n16 the Board applies to make the ultimate decision as to\n\n17 whether the patent is going to survive is in the final\n\n18 decision that the Board renders. At that point in time,\n\n19 it\u0027s too late for the patentee to make any kind of\n\n20 determination as to whether it would like to amend and\n\n21 cancel the claims that are under review.\n\n22 I also think it\u0027s important to distinguish\n\n23 the examinational context, in which, historically, BRI\n\n24 has been cabin to.

we\u0027re dealing with a hybrid\n\n3 entity with characteristics of the PTO and the district\n\n4 court. But it seems to me perfectly clear that Congress\n\n5 meant for this entity to substitute for the judicial\n\n6 action.\n\n7 So why ­­ why should we be so wedded to the\n\n8 way they do business in the PTO with respect to the\n\n9 broadest possible construction when the ­­ the point is\n\n10 not to replicate PTO procedures. It\u0027s supposed to take\n\n11 the place of district court procedures.\n\n12 MR. GANNON: It\u0027s supposed to take the place\n\n13 to some extent, but not to the ultimate extent. It\u0027s\n\n14 not supposed to perfectly replicate the results of\n\n15 district court litigation. And we know that because\n\n16 Congress has imposed structural differences on the IPR\n\n17 proceeding that will guarantee that there could be\n\n18 different results at the end of the day.\n\n19 Most importantly, there\u0027s the different\n\n20 burden of proof.

And\n\n4 it\u0027s going to be about whether the PTO ever should have\n\n5 issued this patent because it was, in fact, anticipated\n\n6 by a prior patent, or it was obvious in light of prior\n\n7 art, and ­­\n\n8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it\u0027s a ­­\n\n9 it\u0027s narrow, but we have the broadest possible\n\n10 construction. I\u0027ll ­­ I\u0027ll work with that. I think\n\n11 you\u0027re probably right.\n\n12 (Laughter.)\n\n13 MR.

This ­­ this is a narrower trap in\n\n18 which the only grounds that can be considered are going\n\n19 to be invalidity on the basis of 102 or 103. And it is\n\n20 true that you do not have to be somebody who would have\n\n21 Article III standing in order to initiate an IPR.\n\n22 That\u0027s another thing that we think shows that this\n\n23 wasn\u0027t intended to be just a perfect substitute for\n\n24 district court litigation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"35","file_name":"Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v.

That\u0027s not just a\n\n14 determination of whether there\u0027s a reasonable likelihood\n\n15 under Subsection A, it\u0027s everything. And that section\n\n16 includes references to 311, to 313. It has at a\n\n17 reference to a decision under this chapter.\n\n18 And so all of that, we think, is included in\n\n19 the scope of the appeal bar, and that distinguishes it\n\n20 from a case like Mach Mining where the presumption\n\n21 against reviewability had not been overcome ­­ or the\n\n22 presumption of favor of reviewability had not been\n\n23 overcome.

BEENEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n5 Let me just begin by saying that as with the\n\n6 government\u0027s brief, we heard nothing today that suggests\n\n7 that the use of the ordinary­claim construction would\n\n8 not accomplish Congress\u0027s purpose. But what we would\n\n9 avoid is all of the bizarre harms that are caused by the\n\n10 use of the broadest­reasonable­interpretation expedient.\n\n11 We have different results, demonstrable different\n\n12 results, as the Chief Justice pointed out. Many of the\n\n13 cases are cited in our brief where a patent is upheld in\n\n14 the district court and then invalidated by the Board.\n\n15 That wouldn\u0027t happen if we used the same\n\n16 claim construction as Congress intended by having a\n\n17 court­like system. We wouldn\u0027t be depriving patent\n\n18 owners of their property rights based on pretending the\n\n19 patent means something that it doesn\u0027t mean. Patent\n\n20 rights should be taken away only if the patent that\u0027s","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"55","file_name":"Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v.
