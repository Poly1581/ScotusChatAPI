CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear argument\n\n4 first this morning in Case 15­6092, Mathis v.\n\n5 United States.\n\n6 Mr. Fleming.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 The Iowa statute under which Mr. Mathis was\n\n12 convicted defines one crime, and Iowa does not need to\n\n13 prove generic burglary to convict under it. The Eighth\n\n14 Circuit below and the government here, nonetheless, want\n\n15 to use the modified categorical approach. Not for its\n\n16 usual purpose, which is to identify the kind of\n\n17 conviction, we know what that is, but rather to identify\n\n18 the means of commission. That is contrary to ACCA\u0027s\n\n19 categorical approach, and it\u0027s irreconcilable with both\n\n20 the result and the reasoning of this Court\u0027s decision in\n\n21 Descamps.\n\n22 One of ­­\n\n23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that so? I mean,\n\n24 here we have the crime, burglary, and there are two ways\n\n25 of committing it.

We give\n\n3 the example of Vermont where it does make a difference.\n\n4 And the reason it makes a difference is because Vermont\n\n5 punishes burglary of a dwelling more severely than\n\n6 burglary of a boat. And so a Vermont prosecutor does\n\n7 need to show which it is because it makes a difference\n\n8 to the sentence. And in that circumstance, the statute\n\n9 is divisible, and it would be proper to go to the\n\n10 modified categorical approach.\n\n11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there are a lot of\n\n12 reasons why Iowa might want to take the approach that\n\n13 it ­­ that it does. Suppose the person is convicted ­­\n\n14 suppose the evidence involves the burglary of a trailer.\n\n15 So you\u0027d have the rather ridiculous situation of a\n\n16 jury ­­ if that was ­­ if those are separate elements,\n\n17 then if six of the jurors thought, well, this trailer is\n\n18 not very movable, so I think it\u0027s a house, and the other\n\n19 others say, well, you know, it\u0027s possible you could hook\n\n20 it up to a truck and move it, so it\u0027s a vehicle.

It may be that the\n\n11 text of the statute tells you that a particular\n\n12 alternative is punished more harshly than others.\n\n13 That\u0027s the case in Vermont.

I mean, the footnote 2 comes as\n\n13 a substance to the dissent, and the dissent says, this\n\n14 is the problem with the entire opinion, is that it keeps\n\n15 on talking about elements, but it\u0027s hard to distinguish\n\n16 between elements and means. And we shouldn\u0027t be\n\n17 distinguishing between those two things.\n\n18 So the whole opinion is this elements focus,\n\n19 which then the dissent attacks.\n\n20 MS. SAHARSKY: Right.

MS.\n\nSAHARSKY: This question only arises\n\n21 when a person has been charged with more than one thing,\n\n22 so a burglary of a building and a boat, for example.\n\n23 And then the question is, if

I think this Court knows from other\n\n13 prior cases that some State drug schedules list a lot of\n\n14 drugs that aren\u0027t on the Federal schedule. So in\n\n15 Mellouli, the Court, you know, had to figure out, is\n\n16 this like the Federal offense or is this not like the\n\n17 Federal offense?

to which you could use\n\n14 judicial decisions. But we do think that in some\n\n15 circumstances a judge could or a court could define a\n\n16 crime. I mean, they\u0027re common law crimes that are just\n\n17 defined by the courts and that those could be divisible,\n\n18 but that\u0027s not ­­ that was ­­ that was reserved in\n\n19 Descamps. That\u0027s not something the Court had to answer.\n\n20 But I think the second answer, which\n\n21 hopefully gets to your question, is, you know, can we ­­\n\n22 either rules of thumb or something with the State courts\n\n23 that we can try to figure out whether something is a\n\n24 means or is an element based on how the statute\u0027s\n\n25 written?

We just think you shouldn\u0027t do it.\n\n18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Here you have a State\n\n19 statute that specifically tells you that this is not an\n\n20 element of the offense.
