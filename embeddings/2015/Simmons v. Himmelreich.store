MARTINEZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 When an FTCA action is dismissed under\n\n12 Section 2680, the resulting judgment of dismissal\n\n13 triggers the judgment bar for two basic reasons. First,\n\n14 the bar applies to any FTCA judgment, and a 2680\n\n15 dismissal counts as a judgment under any sensible\n\n16 definition of that term.\n\n17 Second, 2680 dismissals implicate the bar\u0027s\n\n18 core purpose, which is to protect the government, its\n\n19 functions, and its employees from the burdens and\n\n20 disruptions associated with multiple lawsuits over the\n\n21 same subject matter ­­\n\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a\n\n23 question?

MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, I think that the\n\n3 judgment bar doesn\u0027t merely embrace a rule of res\n\n4 judicata, it embraces a different rule that turns on the\n\n5 application of a judgment. Now, with respect to what\n\n6 Congress did in the Westfall Act, there\u0027s no question\n\n7 that Congress wanted to preserve the option for the\n\n8 plaintiff to bring a Bivens claim, and there\u0027s nothing\n\n9 in our theory of this case that precludes ­­ that would\n\n10 have precluded the plaintiff from bringing that Bivens\n\n11 claim at the outset.\n\n12 But it\u0027s very interesting, and I think it\u0027s\n\n13 very telling what Congress did in the Westfall Act,\n\n14 as ­­ as you adverted to. In Section 2679(b)(2) of the\n\n15 Westfall Act, Congress specifically said that the\n\n16 exclusivity provision that it had enacted in 2679(b)(1)\n\n17 would not apply to Bivens claims. And so it expressly\n\n18 carved out an exception for such claims.\n\n19 But when it did that, it did not carve out a\n\n20 similar exception for Bivens claims to the judgment bar,\n\n21 which is the separate provision in section 2676 that\u0027s\n\n22 at issue in this case. And so Congress created an","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"5","file_name":"Simmons v.

VERGONIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n2 please the Court:\n\n3 Through Section 2680 and the judgment bar,\n\n4 Congress has established a fair and sensible statutory\n\n5 scheme where the government accepts derivative superior\n\n6 liability for the torts of its employees, a plaintiff\n\n7 who tries his claim against the government may not seek\n\n8 a second bite at the apple or duplicative recovery by\n\n9 suing the employee personally. That\u0027s the fair bargain.\n\n10 But where the United States has not waived\n\n11 derivative liability, the judgment bar is not a gotcha\n\n12 provision that prevents a plaintiff who sued the wrong\n\n13 defendant from thereafter suing the correct defendant,\n\n14 the primarily liable employee. Those claims are outside\n\n15 of the bargain. And the \"shall not apply\" directive of\n\n16 Section 2680 makes this perfectly clear.\n\n17 As some of the Justices recognized during\n\n18 counsel\u0027s presentation, that language says that the\n\n19 other provisions of the Act shall not apply. This\n\n20 unambiguously includes the judgment bar.\n\n21 And there\u0027s no inconsistency between that\n\n22 understanding of the \"shall not apply\" language and any\n\n23 of the other clauses or any of this Court\u0027s cases.\n\n24 JUSTICE ALITO: It can\u0027t be read in a","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"29","file_name":"Simmons v.

Substantively, I think the term \"judgment\"\n\n11 is an ambiguous term whereas the term \"shall not apply\"\n\n12 is not an ambiguous term. \"Judgment\" can mean different\n\n13 things in different

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n9 MR.\n\nRAMIREZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n10 I have two main points that I\u0027d like to\n\n11 make.\n\n12 First, with respect to the Postal Service,\n\n13 it\u0027s true that the Postal Reorganization Act says that\n\n14 the FTCA applies to torts that involve the Postal\n\n15 Service. But Respondent\u0027s whole argument is that the\n\n16 FTCA\u0027s protections of sue­and­be­sued agencies doesn\u0027t\n\n17 protect sue­and­be­sued agencies from claims that\n\n18 involve the exceptions within 2680. And so by his own\n\n19 argument, the ­­ the postal ­­ the postal service,\n\n20 because ­­ because if it\u0027s faced with a claim involving\n\n21 the negligent transmission of mail, the Postal Service\n\n22 would not be able to take advantage of 2679(a)\u0027s\n\n23 protections.\n\n24 I think the Court might want to look to the\n\n25 First Circuit\u0027s decision in the Davric case, where it\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n          \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                            \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n              \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                     \n\n              \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n               \n\n             \n\n47\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 addressed this issue. It rejected Respondent\u0027s\n\n2 \"shall not apply\" argument, and it said that it would\n\n3 lead to results that Congress could not have conceivably\n\n4 intended, and we agree with that.\n\n5 The second point I\u0027d like to make is just\n\n6 about the ­­ the purpose of the FTCA.
