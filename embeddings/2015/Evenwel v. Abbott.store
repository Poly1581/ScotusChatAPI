We\n\n13 submit that the answer must be yes under this Court\u0027s\n\n14 decisions, and as a consequence, Appellants have stated\n\n15 a claim under the the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n16 The districts at issue here, District 1 and\n\n17 District 4, have deviations as measured by eligible\n\n18 voters approaching 50 percent under any metric of\n\n19 eligible voters.

MR.\n\nKELLER: The Voting Rights Act?\n\n12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\n\n13 MR.\n\nKELLER: Section 2 of the Voting Rights\n\n14 Act for tax voters ­­ and our position, unlike the\n\n15 United States\u0027s position, is that only voters are\n\n16 protected under the Voting Rights Act. So in\n\n17 considering whether there is an opportunity to elect a\n\n18 candidate of one\u0027s choice, only voters would count for\n\n19 that inquiry. Indeed I ­­\n\n20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it is ­­ it is\n\n21 called the one­person, one­vote. That seems to be\n\n22 designed to protect voters.\n\n23 MR. KELLER: It does protect voters, but\n\n24 there are multiple legitimate bases here on which a\n\n25 State can redistrict. Electoral equality is one of\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n        \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                        \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                          \n\n         \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                          \n\n              \n\n                \n\n                \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n           \n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\n1 them. Representational equality is another.\n\n2 And if I can back out, what we\u0027re dealing\n\n3 with here is the general Equal Protection Clause\u0027s test\n\n4 which ­­ it guards against invidious discrimination.\n\n5 The Court has noted before a mere disparate impact does\n\n6 not violate the Constitution. And so really the claim\n\n7 that\u0027s being alleged here is one of invidious vote\n\n8 dilution.\n\n9 But Texas, by using total population, as\n\n10 States have done for decades, and no State today uses\n\n11 voter population, did not invidiously target groups to\n\n12 cancel out their voting power or reduce their ability to\n\n13 elect representatives of their choice.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"26","file_name":"Evenwel v.

Rather, what Texas was doing was making the\n\n15 legitimate choice to use representational equality,\n\n16 which, as this Court\u0027s cases have noted, is a legitimate\n\n17 interest that the State can account for in\n\n18 redistricting.\n\n19 What the State cannot do is submerge the\n\n20 population principle. In other words, as Reynolds held,\n\n21 we cannot base apportionment on geography. We have to\n\n22 take account of population. And we have done that.\n\n23 There is no allegation here that our\n\n24 8.04 percent deviation of total population would not\n\n25 satisfy the Court\u0027s one­person, one­vote doctrine unless\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n           \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n              \n\n                        \n\n       \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                      \n\n                         \n\n         \n\n                      \n\n                  \n\n           \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                          \n\n         \n\n           \n\n     \n\n29\n\nOfficial\n\n1 we are required to use voter population.\n\n2 JUSTICE ALITO: There are at least two\n\n3 arguments that could support your position. One is that\n\n4 it\u0027s one­person, one­vote, and what counts is giving\n\n5 each person an equal chance of affecting the outcome of\n\n6 the election. But total population figures are a good\n\n7 enough proxy for eligible voters.

It is part of the dignity of\n\n22 State sovereignty to be able to structure elections.\n\n23 And when a ­­ when a State is choosing\n\n24 either representation or equality, when the two are in\n\n25 tension, that\u0027s not an illegitimate basis upon which to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                       \n\n           \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n            \n\n                 \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n \n\n                           \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                          \n\n         \n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\n1 reapportion.\n\n2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if the voter\n\n3 population is a permissible basis under the\n\n4 Constitution, I assume that\u0027s because there is ­­ is an\n\n5 ethical, a good government, a liberty interest in\n\n6 protecting these voters.

Their demographer simply said, well,\n\n3 the deviations can be reduced.\n\n4 If the Court were to try to go down the road\n\n5 of requiring States to equalize within 10 percent of a\n\n6 deviation, both total and voter population, States would\n\n7 inevitably have to disregard many other traditional\n\n8 redistricting factors, like compactness, continuity,\n\n9 keeping communities together. And that would be the\n\n10 opposite of what the Court has said that States have in\n\n11 this context, which is the leeway to structure their\n\n12 elections as part of the core function of their\n\n13 sovereignty.\n\n14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That sounds highly\n\n15 probable to me.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"33","file_name":"Evenwel v.
