They can adhere to\n\n15 their religious beliefs and pay millions of dollars in\n\n16 penalties, or they can take steps that they believe to\n\n17 be religiously and morally objectionable, and that the\n\n18 government deems necessary, for them to provide\n\n19 contraception coverage through their health care plans.\n\n20 Now, the government concedes the sincerity\n\n21 of these religious beliefs, but it attempts to recast\n\n22 them as an objection to the very act of opting out or\n\n23 objecting.

There is no excuse. There is\n\n9 no other way than to do the hard work of looking at the\n\n10 exemptions and seeing whether they make sense.\n\n11 One of the cases that Congress clearly\n\n12 wanted to embrace in RFRA was Yoder.
