Then when the prosecutor\n\n19 testified on the motion for a new trial, he did\n\n20 something I\u0027ve never seen a lawyer do before.

BURTON: Yes.\n\n12 JUSTICE BREYER: And I read on page 192 of\n\n13 the ­­ of your record the decision. And the first\n\n14 paragraph supports your ­­ the view that you would like\n\n15 to hold, I think, that this is based upon res judicata,\n\n16 which is a State matter.\n\n17 And then there is the paragraph that was\n\n18 read to you on page 195 and 196 where the judge says,\n\n19 \"The reason that I reach that conclusion is because the\n\n20 notes and records submitted by Petitioner failed to\n\n21 demonstrate purposeful discrimination on the basis that\n\n22 the race was the basis.\" Okay? That sounds like Batson\n\n23 to me.\n\n24 And then he goes on to say, \"And in addition\n\n25 there is no good reason given, now or then.\"\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                      \n\n               \n\n                            \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n                    \n\n           \n\n                           \n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n                       \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n      \n\n                           \n\n \n\n                                 \n\n     \n\n                        \n\n                           \n\n   \n\n                             \n\n55\n\nOfficial\n\n1 And then he concludes, \"Accordingly, the\n\n2 court finds the renewed Batson claim is without merit.\"\n\n3 So if I read just that paragraph, I would\n\n4 think the reason that the judge found in your favor is\n\n5 he decided the Batson claim in your favor. He didn\u0027t\n\n6 have to. He could have gone on some other ground, but\n\n7 that\u0027s the ground he did go on.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"53","file_name":"Foster v.

Very quickly, let\n\n7 me first say that with regard to what Justice Alito\n\n8 quoted that it\u0027s just come to our attention since the\n\n9 trial of the case that Ms. Garrett cousin was arrested.\n\n10 That was on May the 1st. That was after the death\n\n11 verdict had been returned in this case.\n\n12 Secondly, if you look at the Joint Appendix\n\n13 on page 56 and 57 where they give the reasons for\n\n14 striking Ms. Garrett, there is no mention of her cousin\n\n15 whatsoever in there. That\u0027s the time when she should\n\n16 have been mentioned, after the strikes were made. And\n\n17 yet there is no mention of that at all.\n\n18 So I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way ­­ and then\n\n19 six months later, there is a motion for new trial, and\n\n20 now the prosecution is adding new reasons that it didn\u0027t\n\n21 give at the Batson hearing.\n\n22 It\u0027s saying she was a social worker. She\n\n23 wasn\u0027t a social worker. It\u0027s saying her cousin was\n\n24 arrested. They didn\u0027t know that at the time they struck","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"58","file_name":"Foster v.
