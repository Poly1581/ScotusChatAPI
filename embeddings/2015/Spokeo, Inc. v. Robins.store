It seems to me that the ­­ the one thing\n\n8 that we have to say Congress is better at than we are is\n\n9 identifying concrete harms. I mean, it\u0027s perfectly\n\n10 fine, and I agree with very large portions of your brief\n\n11 when you say they have to have identified a concrete\n\n12 harm. It\u0027s like, fine, yes, they do.\n\n13 But now the question is, did they identify\n\n14 one? And it seems pretty clear what they wanted to do\n\n15 here; that this statute is entirely about preventing the\n\n16 dissemination of inaccurate information in credit\n\n17 reports which they seem to think is both something that\n\n18 harms the individual personally and also harms larger\n\n19 systemic issues. And then they gave the cause of action\n\n20 to the people it harmed personally.\n\n21 And I guess ­­ I mean, don\u0027t we owe them a\n\n22 little bit of respect that they\u0027ve actually identified a\n\n23 real­world harm that it ­­ that\u0027s out there?\n\n24 MR.
