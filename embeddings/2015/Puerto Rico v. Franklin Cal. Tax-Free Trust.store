saying that Puerto Rico\u0027s outside the scope of\n\n2 Chapter 9. A State\u0027s only role in the Chapter 9 regime\n\n3 is to authorize its municipalities to be debtors.\n\n4 Indeed, Chapter 9 can\u0027t apply to Puerto Rico\n\n5 in light of the 1984 amendment. That amendment\n\n6 categorically precludes Puerto Rico from passing through\n\n7 the gateway into Chapter 9, which is located in\n\n8 Chapter 1 in Section 109(c)(2).\n\n9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Landau, that\u0027s true.\n\n10 Don\u0027t you run up against, with respect to the Puerto\n\n11 Rico ­­ Puerto Rico\u0027s legislation, the Contract Clause,\n\n12 the ­­ the bar against impairing contracts; that Puerto\n\n13 Rico can\u0027t impair the lenders\u0027 contracts?\n\n14 So apart from ­­ so if there\u0027s ­­ if we\u0027re\n\n15 dealing only with the Puerto Rico legislation, doesn\u0027t\n\n16 that, in ­­ in requiring nonconsenting lenders to give\n\n17 up or have their claims reduced, Puerto Rico is\n\n18 violating the Contract Clause?\n\n19 MR. LANDAU: Your Honor, the Respondents\n\n20 here have certainly brought Contract Clause claims. And\n\n21 if this Court decides the preemption issue in our favor,\n\n22 then they would certainly be allowed to litigate those\n\n23 contract claims issues on appeal ­­ excuse me ­­ on\n\n24 remand.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"2","file_name":"Puerto Rico v.

But\n\n5 Chapter 9 ­­ but this provision, 101(52), is written\n\n6 much more specifically. It says except for the purpose\n\n7 of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.

of the things that is\n\n14 somewhat unusual, and I think this Court is well aware\n\n15 of the ­­ some of these constitutional status issues\n\n16 regarding Puerto Rico from the pending Sanchez Valle\n\n17 case. I mean, the one thing that everyone in that case\n\n18 agreed on is that Congress, through the Puerto Rico\n\n19 Constitution, has ­­ has recognized a status that gives\n\n20 Puerto Rico an incredible degree of autonomy.\n\n21 The ­­ the dispute in that case is not\n\n22 whether Puerto Rico has this, you know, nearly\n\n23 State­like status. It\u0027s ­­ does that come from the\n\n24 people of Puerto Rico or from Congress? But everyone\n\n25 agrees that Puerto Rico operates in that very unique\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                          \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n            \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n             \n\n               \n\n           \n\n               \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n \n\n                         \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n             \n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n26\n\n1 situation which is really almost the opposite extreme of\n\n2 the spectrum from D.C. where D.C. has to have its laws\n\n3 submitted to Congress, and they can ­­ and they can veto\n\n4 it.\n\n5 So, again, we don\u0027t know why Congress ­­\n\n6 this goes back to the black box ­­ chose to lump these\n\n7 two jurisdictions which are kind of at opposite ends of\n\n8 congressional oversight. Certainly the other side came\n\n9 up with a theory that the First Circuit embraced that\n\n10 Congress was seeking to retain control over Puerto\n\n11 Rico\u0027s municipalities here, which is a very strange\n\n12 theory given that Congress has not had control over\n\n13 Puerto Rico\u0027s municipalities since well before the\n\n14 Puerto Rico ­­ the Commonwealth was created in 1952.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"24","file_name":"Puerto Rico v.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if the ­­ if the\n\n19 definitional section defines \"State\" to include Puerto\n\n20 Rico, and you say even though it\u0027s not a part of Chapter\n\n21 9 by definition in 109,

And he says, what could that apply to?\n\n7 Those entities that are not in Chapter 9 obviously have\n\n8 all the powers they normally had, but the ones that are\n\n9 in Chapter 9 might not. And so what this Section 903 is\n\n10 addressed to are those States that are in Chapter 9,\n\n11 because there\u0027s no need to apply that first sentence to\n\n12 anyone else, and therefore it doesn\u0027t apply to Puerto\n\n13 Rico, that first sentence. But since the key sentences,\n\n14 one and two, are subparts of the first sentence, they\n\n15 don\u0027t apply, either.\n\n16 I think that\u0027s the whole argument. And it\n\n17 isn\u0027t requiring us to really play that much ­­ you don\u0027t\n\n18 play games with the words. All you do is say, this is\n\n19 one of those parts of Chapter 9 ­­ not all, but one of\n\n20 those parts ­­ that even though it doesn\u0027t use the word\n\n21 \"debtor\" under Chapter 9, applies only to debtors under\n\n22 Chapter 9.

It says you\u0027re not a State for one purpose\n\n9 only, which is defining who may be a debtor under\n\n10 Chapter 9, and that\u0027s an unmistakable textual reference\n\n11 to Section 109. And so that tells you that Puerto Rico\n\n12 is a State for every other purpose under the Bankruptcy\n\n13 Code, because that\u0027s what Section 101 says.\n\n14 JUSTICE BREYER: But not ­­ no.

McGILL: So that misapprehends what\n\n2 Section 903 does. What Section 903 is, is at the time\n\n3 Congress is entering the field of municipal debt\n\n4 adjustment in 1937, Section 903 is enacted to say that\n\n5 Congress is not also entering the field of municipal\n\n6 reorganization, reorganization that could occur under\n\n7 Chapter 11. This was a very important point in both the\n\n8 1934 and the 1937 debates. That adjustment was\n\n9 something that was seen as within Congress\u0027s purview.\n\n10 Reorganization of municipalities was seen as within the\n\n11 States\u0027 purview.\n\n12 So Section 903 says we are not entering the\n\n13 field of reorganization when we\u0027re entering the field of\n\n14 debt adjustment. And then Faitoute misreads\n\n15 Section 903(1) ­­ 903, rather. At least in the judgment\n\n16 of the subsequent Congress, Faitoute misread Section 903\n\n17 to permit conflicting municipal bankruptcy laws.\n\n18 And so Congress enacts Section 903(1). This\n\n19 is now nine years later. And it enacts it for a very\n\n20 different purpose than Section 903 was enacted. It\n\n21 enacts a separate provision specifically to overrule\n\n22 this Court\u0027s decision in Faitoute, and to make clear\n\n23 that only under a Federal law should holders of","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"39","file_name":"Puerto Rico v.

That\n\n3 is, it can\u0027t use Chapter 9, and it can\u0027t use a Puerto\n\n4 Rican substitute for Chapter 9. It\u0027s locked out by the\n\n5 provision on which you are relying, so it has to take\n\n6 the bitter, but it doesn\u0027t get any benefit at all.\n\n7 Why in the world ­­ what explains Congress\n\n8 wanting to put Puerto Rico in this anomalous position of\n\n9 not being able to restructure its debt?\n\n10 MR. McGILL: There are a few\n\n11 think. And as Mr. Landau has said, there\n\n12 legislative history that sets this forth\n\n13 let me suggest a few reasons why Congress\n\n14 done what it did.\n\nreasons, I\n\nis no\n\nin detail, but\n\nmight have\n\n15 First, Congress has for a long time\n\n16 micromanaged Puerto Rico\u0027s debt. In the Jones Act, it\n\n17 specifically limited the amount of debt Puerto Rico\n\n18 could take on. That actually was kept and retained\n\n19 through the Public Law 600. And it was only in 1961\n\n20 that Congress ended its own restriction of Puerto Rico\u0027s\n\n21 debt on the condition that the Puerto Rico ­­ Puerto\n\n22 Rico include that restriction in its own constitution.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"40","file_name":"Puerto Rico v.

They just can\u0027t say that when Congress,\n\n7 which had long­defined \"State\" to include all the\n\n8 possessions and Territories, in 1984, in the very\n\n9 provision that we are considering, said \"State\" includes\n\n10 Puerto Rico and D.C.
