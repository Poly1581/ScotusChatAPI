SAUNDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 By its plain terms, the 2006 Veterans Act\n\n12 requires the VA to consider veterans first under the\n\n13 Rule of Two before awarding contracts to other\n\n14 suppliers.\n\n15 That mandate, which applies only to the VA\n\n16 and reflects the agency\u0027s unique obligation to veterans,\n\n17 contains no exception for the contracts formed when the\n\n18 VA makes awards under the Federal Supply Schedule. And\n\n19 the government\u0027s attempt to create such an exception\n\n20 fares no better than its prior attempts to resist the\n\n21 mandate.\n\n22 Its semantic distinction between contracts\n\n23 and orders conflicts with its own concession that an FSS\n\n24 order is a contract in the ordinary sense.

And you\n\n5 can understand why Congress would have done something to\n\n6 say the government ­­ and specifically the VA ­­ has to\n\n7 do a lot better toward meeting its goals.\n\n8 But the goals are still, you know, pretty\n\n9 far down compared to what Justice Breyer was indicating\n\n10 is the natural tendency of this system that you\u0027re\n\n11 describing to produce ­­ you know, almost everything is\n\n12 given to a veteran.\n\n13 MR. SAUNDERS: Well, where there is a\n\n14 veteran that\u0027s eligible. But even at the time that this\n\n15 was done, the goals had always been a 3 percent\n\n16 government­wide goal. Individual agencies were required\n\n17 to set their goals based on the maximum practical\n\n18 opportunity, and so even at the time going into this,\n\n19 the VA had already set a higher goal. I believe it was\n\n20 7 percent.\n\n21 The goals that it had set under the statute\n\n22 have been even higher than that. And the answer is,\n\n23 yes, the government was expecting the VA ­­ this to be\n\n24 an important mandate for the VA because this was tied to\n\n25 the VA\u0027s unique obligation to help veteran­owned small\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n         \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n                            \n\n          \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n                       \n\n             \n\n                \n\n         \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n                \n\n23\n\nOfficial\n\n1 businesses rather than setting up ­­","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"20","file_name":"Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v.

I read the Federal circuit\n\n9 decision, and I expected to open the government brief\n\n10 and say, yeah, the Federal circuit was right.\n\n11 You\u0027re telling us the Federal circuit was\n\n12 wrong.\n\n13 MR. TRIPP: I guess ­­ about the Federal\n\n14 circuit\u0027s position, we think the Federal circuit\u0027s\n\n15 rationale is right, so far as it goes, but that it\u0027s\n\n16 incomplete. And so the Federal circuit has a complete\n\n17 answer for why Petitioner\u0027s sort of maximalist position\n\n18 is wrong, which is that if ­­ if this mandate applies in\n\n19 100 percent of procurements, then the secretary\u0027s\n\n20 discretion to set goals is pretty much wiped out, and","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"24","file_name":"Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v.
