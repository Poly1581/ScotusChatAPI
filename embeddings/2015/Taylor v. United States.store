The first\n\n12 requires that the accused to obtain property from\n\n13 another by either extortion or robbery. The second is\n\n14 the jurisdictional element, in that the consequence of\n\n15 either the extortion or the robbery creates an\n\n16 interference with commerce.\n\n17 The effect on commerce is the jurisdictional\n\n18 element of the crime, and like all elements, it must be\n\n19 proven beyond a reasonable doubt through the\n\n20 introduction of particularized evidence necessary to\n\n21 establish this element.\n\n22 In the case ­­ in this case the government\n\n23 was not required to prove the effect­on­commerce\n\n24 element, which ultimately resulted in the conviction of\n\n25 Mr. Taylor.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                           \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n   \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                         \n\n                   \n\nOfficial\n\n4\n\n1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the things you say\n\n2 in your brief is that you were not even given the\n\n3 opportunity to show that the victims dealt exclusively\n\n4 in home­grown marijuana.\n\n5 If you ­­ if you had that opportunity, how\n\n6 will you have shown that this, the marijuana in\n\n7 question, was grown in Virginia rather than some other\n\n8 place, some other State?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Taylor v.
