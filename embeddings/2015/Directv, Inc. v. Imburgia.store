LANDAU: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n9 and may it please the Court:\n\n10 The court below violated the Federal\n\n11 Arbitration Act by refusing to enforce the parties\u0027\n\n12 arbitration agreement on grounds the Ninth Circuit\n\n13 characterized as \"nonsensical.\"\n\n14 The agreement provides for individual\n\n15 arbitration and expressly precludes class arbitration.\n\n16 And just to underscore that point, it specifies that if\n\n17 State law would force the parties into class\n\n18 arbitration, then the entire arbitration agreement would\n\n19 be unenforceable.\n\n20 The court below interpreted the reference to\n\n21 State law to mean inoperative State law preempted by the\n\n22 FAA. But neither respondents nor the court below\n\n23 identified a single case in the history of California or\n\n24 American law adopting that interpretation for any\n\n25 contract.

the wake of Concepcion, DIRECTV rewrote\n\n11 the contract.\n\nIt did it before the California Court of\n\n12 Appeals\u0027 decision in this case.\n\n13 DIRECTV had another mechanism fully\n\n14 available to it that would account for the idea that\n\n15 now, under the Federal Arbitration Act, the State can\u0027t\n\n16 forbid class action waivers. It didn\u0027t need this\n\n17 contract to do anything other than to pick up existing\n\n18 California law.\n\n19 And I will add a couple of other points just\n\n20 about whether, as a matter of Federal law, you would\n\n21 want to say that right now we have to go to arbitration.\n\n22 Remember, DIRECTV\u0027s position is in the teeth of the\n\n23 efficiency of the Federal Arbitration Act. Its view is\n\n24 that the parties intended that three years into the\n\n25 litigation, what they would want is to blow up the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n          \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                              \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                         \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\nOfficial\n\n44\n\n1 litigation and send everybody to thousands of individual\n\n2 arbitrations. That is an extremely implausible\n\n3 interpretation of what the parties would want if their\n\n4 goal was to have an efficient dispute resolution\n\n5 mechanism.\n\n6 And so what I\u0027m ­­ the point that I\u0027m trying\n\n7 to make, Your Honors, is while I am sympathetic to the\n\n8 concern, and it may be a concern directed at California\n\n9 in particular, that we need to be attentive to whether\n\n10 or not those courts are discriminating against\n\n11 arbitration. My point to you is that you may believe","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"42","file_name":"Directv, Inc. v.

You can say it\u0027s way out of bounds; you\n\n19 could say it\u0027s nonsensical.

They would not extend it here\n\n16 whatsoever, because the four members of the Court who ­­\n\n17 you and the other members of the Court who agreed with\n\n18 it would not extend it to the circumstance in which the\n\n19 parties have agreed by contract.\n\n20 And Justice Thomas explained in his opinion\n\n21 in that case that the opinion there ­­ that the ­­ the\n\n22 principle opinion depended on obstacle preemption, and\n\n23 there is no argument here that this case implicates\n\n24 obstacle preemption because it\u0027s a question of contract\n\n25 law.

State courts, we have to show people that we\u0027re serious.\n\n9 A couple of things about that.\n\n10 First is, we know the California courts are\n\n11 serious in the wake of ­­ excuse me. We have filed a\n\n12 supplemental brief. The California Supreme Court has\n\n13 decided a case called Sanchez. And Sanchez dealt with\n\n14 the contract that is written like every other Fortune\n\n15 500 contract is. And it talks about if the ­­ the\n\n16 provision barring class action waivers would be deemed\n\n17 invalid. And the California Supreme Court said that\u0027s\n\n18 controlled by Concepcion. That is an enforceable\n\n19 arbitration agreement right there. And so now we are\n\n20 dancing on the head of the pin about one contract that\u0027s\n\n21 entirely defunct, and the question of whether the\n\n22 reference to State law, when contrasted in another\n\n23 provision of the contract with Federal law, is so far\n\n24 out of bounds.\n\n25 I think that what you have to do is compare\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n              \n\n         \n\n                               \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n     \n\n                             \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n               \n\nOfficial\n\n53\n\n1 two prospects, Justice Breyer.

The California Court of Appeals\n\n12 has told us. This interpretation of State law is just\n\n13 too bad and invalidated my arbitration agreement, that\u0027s\n\n14 now a question of Federal law, and we are going to\n\n15 relitigate what State law means. That is a boundless\n\n16 rule that is going to be invoked in every single\n\n17 arbitration case. And so you just have to choose\n\n18 between those two prospects.\n\n19 One is you know what will happen. You will\n\n20 be going against the very first principle of Federal\n\n21 arbitration law, which is that we look to State law in\n\n22 determining whether an arbitration agreement is formed,\n\n23 or you have the hypothetical prospect.
