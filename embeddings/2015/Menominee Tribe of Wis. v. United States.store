CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear argument\n\n4 next in Case 14­510, Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin\n\n5 v. the United States.\n\n6 Mr. Strommer.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY D. STROMMER\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. STROMMER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 The facts in this case are very complex, but\n\n12 the legal question that is presented to you today is\n\n13 relatively straightforward to state. And the legal\n\n14 question is whether or not an individual or an entity\n\n15 that reasonably relies on class­action tolling can, if\n\n16 tolling is found to be ineffective at a later date, then\n\n17 rely on the same facts to argue that equitable tolling\n\n18 under Holland should apply.\n\n19 In the Irwin case, this Court specifically\n\n20 cross­referenced American Pipe as an example of a\n\n21 defective pleading that could satisfy equitable tolling.\n\n22 American Pipe obviously being a class­action tolling\n\n23 rule.\n\n24 We read that cross­reference as a suggestion\n\n25 that, under the right circumstances, if somebody\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n           \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n   \n\n                              \n\n         \n\n                            \n\n           \n\n                    \n\n     \n\n                        \n\n           \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n                      \n\n                             \n\n             \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 reasonably relies on class­action tolling facts that\n\n2 ultimately prove to be ineffective, that that individual\n\n3 has the ability to ask the Court to find that equitable\n\n4 tolling should apply.\n\n5 If there is such a case, the facts of this\n\n6 case really should satisfy this test.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Menominee Tribe of Wis. v.

Indeed, the Tribe made a\n\n9 strategic calculation here to allow the six­year CDA\n\n10 statute of limitations to pass, because it wanted to\n\n11 monitor the litigation by other tribes, rather than file\n\n12 and pursue its own action.\n\n13 The miscalculation that it made about\n\n14 whether the clear deadline could be extended by class\n\n15 action tolling, that was a routine litigation mistake,\n\n16 the kind that is far from the sort of extraordinary\n\n17 circumstance that could warrant equitable relief. Nor\n\n18 did that miscalculation prevent the Tribe from filing\n\n19 earlier. To the extent that there was uncertainty as to\n\n20 whether it was a member of the Cherokee Nation class,\n\n21 and whether presentment was a jurisdictional bar to that\n\n22 class membership, the prudent course, and any reasonably\n\n23 diligent litigant would have filed under the clear\n\n24 deadline, rather than wait for the uncertain application\n\n25 of tolling and the potential forfeiture of its claims.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                           \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                         \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n            \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                       \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                         \n\n     \n\n                        \n\nOfficial\n\n21\n\n1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did it know that, in\n\n2 Cherokee Nation?

even if Cherokee Nation\n\n2 had been certified during the pendency of the class\n\n3 certification determination, the Tribe was barred.\n\n4 But importantly, the Cherokee Nation class\n\n5 was not granted. It was denied. And it was denied, as\n\n6 Justice Ginsburg pointed out, two years before the CDA\n\n7 deadline would expire for the first claim. And the\n\n8 Tribe waited more than four years after class denial to\n\n9 present its claim.\n\n10 There was no basis for waiting. At that\n\n11 point, the Tribe knew it must pursue an individual\n\n12 action, and the only reason it waited was to hope that\n\n13 this Court would more conclusively reject, and did\n\n14 eventually conclusively reject, the government\u0027s\n\n15 affirmative defense that it was asserting in that case.\n\n16 But the ­­ the idea that a ­­ a Tribe, or ­­\n\n17 or any litigant, who could have acted earlier chooses to\n\n18 delay for strategic reasons, and then could get tolling\n\n19 when it finds out that it miscalculated the deadline,\n\n20 would be unprecedented. And in fact, the fact that\n\n21 equitable tolling is foreclosed follows directly from\n\n22 this Court\u0027s cases.\n\n23 It simply is a common litigation problem\n\n24 that this Court has addressed time and again, where a\n\n25 litigant believes the deadline is longer than it is,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n                       \n\n                       \n\n                \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                            \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                       \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n              \n\n                     \n\n                \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n1 believes their claim occurred later than it did,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"22","file_name":"Menominee Tribe of Wis. v.

EISENSTEIN: Well, there weren\u0027t\n\n7 consequences in terms of its ability to contract with\n\n8 his, or ­­ or the terms on which it could contract with\n\n9 his going forward. I think that there are consequences\n\n10 in equity when a party releases what ­­ releases a claim\n\n11 affirmatively, whether or not that was something that\n\n12 was required of it. It voluntarily signed that release.\n\n13 But ­­ but ultimately, even without the\n\n14 release, the ­­ the Tribe took no action to pursue its\n\n15 claim during the statutory period. And counsel for the\n\n16 Tribe suggests that we should equate the rules for\n\n17 class­action tolling and equitable tolling, but equity\n\n18 operates under different ­­ different rules. And the\n\n19 diligence requirement is paramount among them.\n\n20 Equitable tolling requires the party to\n\n21 demonstrate diligence throughout the entire period it\n\n22 seeks tolled, and it requires that the impediment to\n\n23 suit actually prevent the timely filing.

For\n\n9 example, having presented its claim, and if it did so\n\n10 prior to ­­ it said it hoped to be a part of the\n\n11 Cherokee Nation class action, if it did so prior to the\n\n12 Cherokee Nation class action, and the Cherokee Nation\n\n13 class action was in fact certified, then ­­ then it may\n\n14 have an argument it\u0027s part of that class.\n\n15 To the extent to which the Cherokee Nation\n\n16 class was denied, then the only ­­ then the presentment\n\n17 requirement was the necessary step to moving forward to\n\n18 presenting its claim individually at the contract, Board\n\n19 of Contract Appeals level or at the judicial level.\n\n20 So I don\u0027t believe that the inevitability of\n\n21 further litigation in any way is a basis for tolling in\n\n22 this case.\n\n23 If there are no further questions, thank\n\n24 you.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"30","file_name":"Menominee Tribe of Wis. v.
