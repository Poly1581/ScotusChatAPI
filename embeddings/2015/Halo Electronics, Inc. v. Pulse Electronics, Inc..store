Congress passed The America\n\n20 Invents Act, didn\u0027t modify it, and so may have, in that\n\n21 sense, either acquiesced or ratified it under those\n\n22 circumstances.\n\n23 And second, we\u0027re talking about punitive\n\n24 damages.

And we have tried, and I\n\n23 believe we have succeeded, in crafting an approach that\n\n24 balances the Court\u0027s concerns with the need to respect\n\n25 the rights of patentees, including small companies like\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                            \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n                \n\n             \n\n                        \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n              \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                          \n\n                 \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n                \n\n     \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Halo.\n\n2 And we\u0027ve done it in a couple of different\n\n3 ways.\n\n4 Reasonable, good­faith efforts to ­­ to\n\n5 challenge patents are not going to result in enhanced\n\n6 damages.

It thought it\n\n10 had to in light of this Court\u0027s decision in Safeco,\n\n11 which it has misread. Safeco says if you adopt a\n\n12 reasonable view of the law at the time, you\u0027re not\n\n13 acting willfully. It doesn\u0027t say if you subjectively\n\n14 and correctly believe that you are violating the law,\n\n15 you are held not to be willful because you have hired a\n\n16 good lawyer and come up with a defense later.\n\n17 And that approach is what has skewed the\n\n18 incentives in the patent system and taken us out of\n\n19 balance.\n\n20 Our approach incentivizes good, commercially\n\n21 reasonable behavior under the full set of circumstances\n\n22 at the discretion of the district court.
