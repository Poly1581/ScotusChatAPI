BASOMBRIO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\n10 it please the Court:\n\n11 This personal injury action is based upon an\n\n12 accident that occurred in Austria. If this Court\n\n13 agrees, there\u0027s no need to reach the other question\n\n14 related to agency, so I will start first with the\n\n15 based­upon issue.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"OBB Personenverkehr AG v.

And the\n\n21 language here is very similar, right? There\u0027s the\n\n22 insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact,\n\n23 and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of\n\n24 relationship between that contact ­­ contact and the\n\n25 claim.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                               \n\n                 \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n \n\n                         \n\n                   \n\n         \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n               \n\n           \n\n         \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n                        \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\nOfficial\n\n6\n\n1 So it seems ­­ I guess the question is: Why\n\n2 should we think of these two questions as at all\n\n3 different?

KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n19 please the Court:\n\n20 I\u0027d like to start with the point about\n\n21 whether the FSIA simply incorporates due process\n\n22 standards, and we think it does not. It contains its\n\n23 own statutory terms which require interpretation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"21","file_name":"OBB Personenverkehr AG v.

It had to do\n\n7 what ­­ with what is the focus of the claim. And there\n\n8 the Court was focusing on tort claims that happened\n\n9 outside the United States.

What the ­­ what that brief says is that based\n\n9 on the language in various conventions, that this claim\n\n10 wouldn\u0027t be able to be brought somewhere else. But the\n\n11 language in those conventions are things like arise\n\n12 under, based upon, and so you basically end up in the\n\n13 same situation as you are here which is having to decide\n\n14 whether this claim can be brought.\n\n15 Remember that brief also alleges and it\n\n16 actually spends more time alleging that there is no\n\n17 proper principle­agent relationship, which I think is ­­\n\n18 the Court has probably realized is not a very credible\n\n19 argument.
