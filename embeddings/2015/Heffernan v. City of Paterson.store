That he was\n\n6 not engaging in association, he was not engaging in\n\n7 trying to convey a message, he was just picking up a\n\n8 sign for his mother.

MS.\n\nANDERS: Well, so there ­­ there is, I\n\n11 think, a factual dispute about this.\n\nSo if you look at\n\n12 the ­­ the summary judgment filings, this is document\n\n13 No. 189 on Pacer, there ­­ there are, in ­­ in the\n\n14 Respondents\u0027 statement of undisputed facts, some\n\n15 assertions that this was in fact a neutrality policy.\n\n16 Now you definitely have a dispute about that\n\n17 coming back from the other side. Petitioner says that\n\n18 nobody knew about that policy. So we think that is one\n\n19 thing that potentially the lower courts would have to\n\n20 look at, decide whether it was preserved and ­­ and\n\n21 resolve the dispute in that sense.\n\n22 But I do want to get back to another concern\n\n23 that I think Respondents\u0027 position raises. You know, we\n\n24 do think that ­­ that Petitioner has his own First\n\n25 Amendment right here.

But what we\u0027re talking about here in the\n\n6 context in which there is a real concern that I would\n\n7 like to talk about, about whether it will interfere with\n\n8 the management of local government, that it\u0027s an\n\n9 affirmative constitutional right, it\u0027s a violation of\n\n10 the First Amendment.\n\n11 Now the reason you ought to be concerned,\n\n12 Justice Kennedy, is there is another side of the coin.\n\n13 Take it from the perspective of the supervisor. If this\n\n14 right is recognized, which is to say the plaintiff need\n\n15 not have engaged in any association, then the\n\n16 supervisor\u0027s expression of political views may well be\n\n17 chilled because he has to worry that any employee can\n\n18 say, look, I was regarded as politically active.\n\n19 If I could just give you this case again,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"37","file_name":"Heffernan v.

GOLDSTEIN: Justice ­­\n\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There\u0027s nothing to\n\n5 prevent this otherwise, like the Hatch Act.\n\n6 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think it\u0027s a really\n\n7 important point on the question of chilling because\n\n8 Elrod and Branti and the rules that also ­­ and O\u0027Hare,\n\n9 which is a one­off case, do say that you can\u0027t do this\n\n10 for political purposes if the person is actually\n\n11 exercising a constitutional right.\n\n12 So that we all agree that if the plaintiff\n\n13 here was a supporter of Spagnola, or even of the mayor,\n\n14 or had decided to remain politically neutral, this is a\n\n15 bizarre case that comes to you on the assumption that he\n\n16 is completely politically apathetic.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"49","file_name":"Heffernan v.
