gave the example of day care centers.\n\n2 ERISA plans can run day care centers. I don\u0027t think\n\n3 anyone doubts that you can have all sorts of reporting\n\n4 requirements to make sure the staff is trained, the\n\n5 facilities are safe. And so forth.\n\n6 This Court\u0027s case in De Buono upheld a tax\n\n7 imposed on employer contributions to an ERISA medical\n\n8 benefit plan that provided the medical benefits\n\n9 directly. And we told the Court at the time that that\n\n10 tax had all sorts of reporting requirements. So\n\n11 essentially, the question is here, where to draw the\n\n12 line between reporting requirements that are permissible\n\n13 and those that are nonpermissible.\n\n14 As I take Respondent\u0027s view, it\u0027s that\n\n15 they\u0027re ­­ it\u0027s certain information that is so core to\n\n16 the plan that you simply can\u0027t have State law reporting\n\n17 requirements about that information.\n\n18 I don\u0027t think that can be right. Take, for\n\n19 example, real property held in trust by a pension plan.\n\n20 DOL requires reporting on that. Obviously, you need to\n\n21 know the assets the pension plan has, but certainly a\n\n22 State taxing authority can require reporting about that\n\n23 same information to assess a property tax.\n\n24 The same was true with the tax in De Buono.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"17","file_name":"Gobeille v.

And the\n\n7 United States has explained in its brief that those\n\n8 programs depend upon the collection of all­payer data,\n\n9 which is something only the States are doing.\n\n10 The promise here is enormous, and the\n\n11 fact ­­ and the loss of this data to the plans would be\n\n12 tremendous. I would like to address briefly one issue\n\n13 that my friend raised, which is the question of provider\n\n14 data. Vermont does, in fact, collect provider data, and\n\n15 we\u0027ve collected it for a very long time. It\u0027s called\n\n16 hospital discharge data, and it was one of the first\n\n17 data sets that researchers looked to.

If someone has their\n\n21 knee replaced, it starts with the doctor\u0027s visit, their\n\n22 surgery. There\u0027s an anesthesiologist. There\u0027s a stay\n\n23 at a rehab facility. There\u0027s follow­up physical\n\n24 therapy.
