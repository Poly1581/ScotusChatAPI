CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear argument\n\n4 first this morning in Case 14­361, Ocasio v.\n\n5 United States.\n\n6 Mr. Davis.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ETHAN P. DAVIS\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. DAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 The Hobbs Act requires that a defendant\n\n12 obtain property from another. In this case, Mr. Ocasio\n\n13 was charged with conspiring with the owners of a repair\n\n14 shop not to obtain property from another, but from the\n\n15 owners themselves.\n\n16 The plain language of the Hobbs Act resolves\n\n17 this case. When two people agree that one will pay the\n\n18 other a bribe, they have merely agreed to exchange\n\n19 property between themselves, not to obtain property from\n\n20 another. The historical background, the statutory\n\n21 structure, and basic criminal ­­ principles of criminal\n\n22 law all point in the same direction.

\"another woman,\" it doesn\u0027t make sense to say that she\n\n5 could have transported another woman when she was merely\n\n6 transporting herself.\n\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, they\u0027re two different\n\n8 words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be\n\n9 identical, which is that it\u0027s just not natural to say\n\n10 that the transported woman is herself transporting any\n\n11 woman, right? I mean, the transported woman is not\n\n12 transporting any woman.\n\n13 But the reason the Court said that a\n\n14 conspiracy was possible there was because the\n\n15 transported woman could agree with another person, let\u0027s\n\n16 say, the man, that the man would transport any woman,\n\n17 namely, herself. It\u0027s ­­ it\u0027s an almost identical\n\n18 syntactical issue.\n\n19 MR. DAVIS: I don\u0027t think so, Your Honor.

The first is that under the jury instructions,\n\n20 the jury could have convicted Ocasio based on a\n\n21 conspiracy solely between him and the repair shop\n\n22 owners, and under this Court\u0027s decision in Skilling, if\n\n23 a ­­ if the jury could have returned a legally­invalid\n\n24 verdict, the conviction has to be reversed.\n\n25 And I think that\u0027s a sufficient answer to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n             \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                \n\n               \n\n              \n\n             \n\n   \n\n                         \n\n           \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                           \n\n                \n\n             \n\n              \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                      \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n \n\n14\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the question, but my second answer is that we disagree\n\n2 with the government that there was sufficient evidence\n\n3 in the record linking Ocasio with other police officers.\n\n4 The evidence showed only that these police officers were\n\n5 generally aware of what each other were doing.

under this Court\u0027s decision in Kotteakos,\n\n8 it was a hub­and­spokes conspiracy without the rim\n\n9 enclosing the spokes.\n\n10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think if I\u0027m\n\n11 remembering the government\u0027s response to your first\n\n12 point, is that it certainly would have been harmless\n\n13 error in this case.\n\n14 MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, I find that response\n\n15 a little difficult to understand. The ­­ the trial\n\n16 overwhelmingly focused on linking Ocasio with Moreno and\n\n17 Mejia, not with other police officers. The vast\n\n18 majority of the testimony was about Moreno and Mejia\n\n19 forming an agreement with Ocasio.\n\n20 The government\u0027s whole case went through\n\n21 Moreno and Mejia. And the government would have had a\n\n22 much more difficult case if it had to prove an agreement\n\n23 between police officers to obtain property from Moreno\n\n24 and Mejia.

DAVIS: Justice Kagan, I don\u0027t disagree\n\n2 with you, but with an asterisk. I think there is a gray\n\n3 area there where someone just acquiesces to an official\n\n4 demand like you\u0027re saying. Those may not be\n\n5 conspiratorial agreements. But I think still, there is\n\n6 a large category of bribery cases that would ­­ would\n\n7 still be conspiratorial agreements under the\n\n8 government\u0027s theory, anytime someone, like in Salinas,\n\n9 pays a bribe in exchange for official action and wasn\u0027t\n\n10 required to do so.\n\n11 So I think still the government\u0027s theory\n\n12 would render some of the language in 666 unnecessary.\n\n13 You know, 18 U.S.C. 666 has specific monetary thresholds\n\n14 put on when a bribe is a Federal crime. And the ­­ and\n\n15 none of ­­ the bribe has to be over $5,000. The State\n\n16 official has to work for an agency that receives $10,000\n\n17 or more in Federal funds.

the question was\n\n22 whether a woman who was transported could conspire to\n\n23 violate the Act.\n\n24 In answering that question, the Court\n\n25 focused on two things. First of all, although the Act\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n            \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                              \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                       \n\n                     \n\n                  \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n                  \n\n29\n\nOfficial\n\n1 contemplates the involvement of the woman, it doesn\u0027t\n\n2 impose substantive criminal liability on her. And,\n\n3 second, some minimal form of agreement is an inherent\n\n4 feature of most instances of the offense.\n\n5 Based on those two factors, the Court said,\n\n6 if that\u0027s all there is, if the only thing that the woman\n\n7 agrees to is to the transportation itself, that is, the\n\n8 bare outlines of the crime, that by itself would be\n\n9 insufficient to make her a conspirator.

Petitioner\u0027s only response is there may be\n\n8 some other statute that you could prosecute under in the\n\n9 case in which the \"from another\" and \"to another\" are\n\n10 both officials of other governments. But what if there\n\n11 are not?

MR.\n\nDAVIS: Justice Breyer, I think the\n\n15 words \"namely Sam\" are doing all the work there.\n\nIf you\n\n16 cut out the words \"namely Sam,\" all of a sudden it\n\n17 doesn\u0027t make sense anymore. If he goes to the police\n\n18 officers and says, let me help you obtain property from\n\n19 another, you need to add words to the statute in order\n\n20 for that to make sense.\n\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Davis, I don\u0027t think you\n\n22 need to add words. What you need is to shift\n\n23 perspective. There is a difference here, but that\u0027s the\n\n24 difference, that the government is insisting that you\n\n25 look at it from the perspective of the person who, in\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n     \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n         \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n \n\n                       \n\n                  \n\n                          \n\nOfficial\n\n57\n\n1 this case, is doing the acts of obtaining property from\n\n2 another. And you are insisting that it be looked at\n\n3 from the perspective of the person who has agreed to\n\n4 help him do that.\n\n5 But there\u0027s no reason under standard\n\n6 conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the\n\n7 agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator.\n\n8 MR. DAVIS: Justice Kagan, with respect, I\n\n9 don\u0027t agree with that.
