MILLER: But even granting both of those\n\nextensions of the decision, the rule in -- in Hyatt is\n\nthat the State cannot treat another state worse than it\n\nwould treat itself.\n\nSo if you applied the analogy here, you\n\nwould say that Connecticut has a regime in which an\n\naction against a state employee is barred, but instead\n\nyou sue the state directly.\n\nSo applying that here, you would say, well,\n\nwe can\u0027t sue Mr. Clarke, so instead we get to sue the\n\ntribe. But the tribe doesn\u0027t want that because the\n\ntribe is not willing to subject itself to jurisdiction\n\nin Connecticut. The tribe has not waived its sovereign\n\nimmunity in Connecticut courts. So the tribe is not\n\nasking for application of that principle of Hyatt; it\u0027s\n\nasking for something quite a bit more.
