That position contradicts the text, structure,\n\nhistory, and purpose of Section 853.\n\nThe government\u0027s position boils down to the\n\ntheory that even though Petitioner did not actually\n\nobtain this money, he should be deemed to have obtained\n\nit because his co-conspirator did based on supposed\n\nbackground principles of conspiracy law. But those\n\nbackground principles are both inconsistent with the\n\ntext of Section 853 and also do not apply on their own\n\nterms.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Honeycutt v.

whole, which\n\nsupports our view that really Section 853(a)(1) is\n\ntalking about forfeiture of tainted assets. And in the\n\ngovernment\u0027s brief, again, they agree with this some --\n\nsurprisingly in our view. They say that yes, Section\n\n853(a)(1) only requires a forfeiture of tainted assets,\n\nwhich means there is no joint-and-several liability. So\n\nwhat the government has essentially admitted here is\n\nthat when one person obtains something, in fact, there\n\nis no joint-and-several liability. Only the tainted\n\nassets are subject to forfeiture, so only the person who\n\nactually obtains it can forfeit it.\n\nAnd, in fact, at the time that Section 853\n\nwas enacted, there was no substitute assets provision,\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nso at that time, just there was no joint-and-several","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"5","file_name":"Honeycutt v.

joint-and-several\n\nliability is the separate substitute assets forfeiture\n\nprovision in 853(p). But that just has no basis\n\nwhatsoever in the statutory text. I just ask the Court\n\nto just read Section 853(p). What it says is, if based\n\non an act or omission of the defendant, property\n\ndescribed in Section 853(a)(1) is unavailable for a\n\nseries of enumerated reasons, then the government can\n\nseek substitute forfeiture. And I think it\u0027s just\n\nobvious what\u0027s that -- that\u0027s doing.\n\nWhat it\u0027s saying is that if the defendant\n\ndoes something to thwart the forfeiture of the tainted\n\nasset, then the court can go after the defendant\u0027s\n\nsubstitute assets.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I suppose\n\ntheir answer would be that under Pinkerton, when you\u0027re\n\ntalking about the defendant, you\u0027re also talking about\n\nco-conspirators.\n\nMR.

Because\n\nthis joint-and-several liability issue has never come\n\nup, ever, in the context of conspiracy law.\n\nSo what the government is doing is saying\n\nthat it thinks it makes sense as a matter of policy to\n\napply those background principles from very different\n\ncontexts to forfeiture law, but altered in different\n\nways. So there\u0027s joint-and-several liability; it\n\napplies to some sections but not others, and that is\n\njust not the way the Court has read criminal statutes.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It does have a number of\n\ncourts -- courts of appeals on its side, doesn\u0027t it?\n\nMR. UNIKOWSKY: That is certainly true, and\n\nthe split does favor the government, we agree. But\n\nthere\u0027s a lot of different ways we point out in our\n\nreply brief where the government\u0027s positions in this\n\ncase actually diverge to some extent from lower courts.\n\nAnd in fact, just one very recent\n\ndevelopment I would raise to the Court\u0027s attention.

And in\n\nfact, there\u0027s been several court of appeals cases in\n\nwhich people have held to have indirectly obtained money\n\nwhen it flows to a corporation that ultimately are\n\ncontrolling the money.

The correct reading is that\n\n\"obtained\" refers to assets that you actually got. And\n\nyou can\u0027t forfeit tainted assets unless you have them,\n\nand so it doesn\u0027t apply to untainted assets.\n\nSo the government\u0027s position in this Court\n\nis completely different from the positions it took\n\nbelow. It\u0027s essentially conceding that under Section\n\n853(a)(1) itself, forfeiture is unavailable except as\n\nagainst the tainted assets. So the government\u0027s\n\narguments that it seems to have -- that we waived\n\nsomething below is just completely incorrect.

then we get to the issues about 853(p)\n\nand the money judgments, and I think I heard counsel say\n\nin his presentation that Section 853(p) does not provide\n\nthe exclusive methods for the government to obtain a\n\nforfeiture against tainted assets. I think that\u0027s a\n\nreference to the argument in their brief regarding the\n\nrules of criminal procedure, and that there\u0027s forfeiture\n\nmoney judgments discussed in Rule 32.2, and that is just\n\nclearly wrong.\n\nFirst, the rule itself -- itself says that\n\nthe government can only forfeit assets that are\n\navailable by statute.\n\nSecond of all, the rules enabling that would\n\njust obviously prevent the government from -- in\n\nrequiring forfeiture that is not authorized by statute\n\nthrough a rule of criminal procedure. I think it\u0027s\n\npretty clear what this rule of criminal procedure is\n\ndoing, and we cite an Eighth Circuit case that says what\n\nwe\u0027re going to say right now, which is to say it says\n\nthat it\u0027s a procedural mechanism of implementing the\n\nsubstitute property provision. So the government can\n\nsay: Okay, we\u0027re going to forfeit your substitute\n\nproperty, whether you spent the money or you hid the\n\nmoney.
