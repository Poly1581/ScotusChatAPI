Justice\n\nBreyer\u0027s question was the second question that the Court\n\ndidn\u0027t grant cert on.\n\nTo talk about the question that the Court\n\ndid grant cert on, I do think it\u0027s important that this\n\nissue wasn\u0027t presented in Ake because this is a Federal\n\nhabeas case, and this is the first time that anyone\n\nrepresenting a State or the Federal government has been\n\nable to stand here and argue that a neutral expert\n\nactually does satisfy the Due Process Clause.\n\nAnd we would submit that the way Federal\n\nhabeas is supposed to work in this area is that the\n\nStates sort of get a first shot at the -- the Supreme\n\nCourt to -- to argue our position.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any\n\njurisdiction that holds that today, that all that Ake\n\nrequires is a neutral expert? I thought by now every\n\njurisdiction recognizes that Ake requires an expert who\n\nwill be, essentially, part of the defense team.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"40","file_name":"McWilliams v.

Subject to Final Review\n\nadversary system.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s what we come back to at\n\nthe end on this case, is the proper working of the\n\nadversary system. And this certainly doesn\u0027t put the\n\ndefense in an equal position with the prosecutor, not by\n\na long shot, but it at least gives the defense a shot,\n\nat least gives them one competent mental health expert\n\nthat they can talk to, understand what the issues are,\n\npresent them as best they can. And one of the things it\n\nsays is that that expert may very well testify for the\n\ndefense.\n\nSo we\u0027re talking about everything from\n\ngathering information, to organizing it, to preparing or\n\ndeciding on the defense to be used in the case, to\n\ncoaching the -- or advising the lawyer about\n\ncross-examination, to actually testifying.\n\nAnd this is like with Strickland v.\n\nWashington. And -- and the statement that was made\n\nthere, in this Court in two cases, in Wiggins v. Smith\n\nand Williams v. Taylor, looked at the rule. That is,\n\nthat there had to be an investigation that was clearly\n\nestablished in Strickland, and then applied it to the\n\nlack of investigation, different kind of investigations\n\nfor different things, in Smith and in Williams v.\n\nTaylor.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"56","file_name":"McWilliams v.
