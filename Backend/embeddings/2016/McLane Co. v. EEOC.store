There are essentially two\n\nrulings by the district court, one on the pedigree\n\ninformation sought -- the name, address, Social Security\n\nnumber, et cetera, of the people who had taken the\n\nstrength test at issue -- and a second part, a\n\ndisclosure of the reasons for the termination of the\n\nemployees who had failed the test.\n\nAs I read the record below, the district\n\ncourt did not give a reason for denying the second\n\nrequest. And the court of appeals basically said, we\n\ncan\u0027t under any standard of review credit a non-reason\n\nfor denying something, so we reverse the district court\n\non that.\n\nAre you challenging that particular ruling,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"5","file_name":"McLane Co. v.

KOVNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\nplease the Court:\n\nHistorical and functional considerations\n\nstrongly support an abuse of discretion standard of\n\nreview here. And with respect to the functional\n\nconsiderations, if I could turn to Justice Ginsburg\u0027s\n\nquestion about why district courts are better situated\n\nto address this question even though it comes to them on\n\na largely documentary record, we think there are a\n\ncouple reasons.\n\nThe first is that this Court indicated in\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n17\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBuford that when a district court just sees a lot more\n\nof a fact-specific question, the district court is often\n\ngoing to have more expertise in answering that question.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"15","file_name":"McLane Co. v.
