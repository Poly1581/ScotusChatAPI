PINCUS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nJust a couple of quick points.\n\nWith respect to the -- the question about\n\nwhether the FAA is limited to arbitration agreements, I\n\nthink it\u0027s important to note that the text of the FAA\n\nsays that arbitration agreements shall be valid\n\nirrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as\n\nexist at law or in equity for the revocation of any\n\ncontract.\n\nSo it\u0027s true the focus of the FAA is on\n\nwhether the arbitration agreement is enforceable or not,\n\nbut there\u0027s nothing in the FAA that prohibits its\n\napplication to an antecedent agreement if that\n\nantecedent agreement prohibits the enforcement of the\n\narbitration agreement on a ground that\u0027s specific to\n\narbitration.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s not only true of the text\n\nof the statutes; it\u0027s true because the implications of\n\nthat rule would be quite dramatic. For example, a State\n\ncould just enact a statute that says a power of attorney\n\ncan never be interpreted to confer the ability to enter\n\ninto an arbitration agreement either at all, which my\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfriend, I think, acknowledged would -- would be\n\nproblematic under the FAA or could impose all kinds of","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"39","file_name":"Kindred Nursing Centers Ltd. v.
