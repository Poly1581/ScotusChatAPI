You looked at those alternative maps, and\n\nthey weren\u0027t, you know -- I mean, you know, it was not\n\nbeyond the ken of man to come up with alternative maps\n\nin that case. The problem with alternative maps in that\n\ncase is that they actually showed that the legislature\n\nwas exactly right.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: What you want me to say is\n\neven though the district court listened to the map\n\ndrawer and believed him, and his statements are pretty\n\nmuch against you, and then they heard two of the State\n\nsenators, and they were pretty much against you, and\n\nit\u0027s up to the district court to evaluate the strength\n\nof witnesses, and came to the conclusion on the basis of\n\nfact that, in fact, it was -- race was really the\n\nexplanation.\n\nDespite that, everyone who comes in has to\n\nhave an alternative map. And, of course, if we have\n\nfive intervenors and so forth, we\u0027re going to have five\n\nor six different alternative maps drawing 400 -- I don\u0027t\n\nknow, a hundred State legislatures and so forth.\n\nThat\u0027s what I\u0027m supposed to say?\n\nMR.

There are all manner of ways to\n\nprove that race predominated. I would point out that we\n\noffered no alternative map in the last case.

ELIAS: Because in each of these cases,\n\nand in Alabama, they offered no alternative map. In\n\neach of these cases, there was no need to provide an\n\nalternative map to prove circumstantially what amply\n\nexisted directly. It is not true that the State of\n\nAlabama, in that case, or the State of Virginia, in this\n\ncase, did not assert political motives as a defense to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"28","file_name":"McCrory v.

SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\nplease the Court:\n\nI\u0027d like to start with Congressional\n\nDistrict 12. This is the serpentine district, the one\n\nthat basically everyone agrees looks terrible, and the\n\nquestion is whether race was the predominant motive or\n\nwhether it was politics.\n\nNow, this determination, the Court has said\n\non numerous occasions, is one that\u0027s reviewed for clear\n\nerror. And the district had a lot of evidence before\n\nit. It went through a three-day trial. And I just want\n\nto highlight some of the key evidence that it relied\n\nupon in making credibility determinations and in finding\n\nthat race was the predominant motive.\n\nAnd that starts with Congressman Watts\u0027\n\ntestimony that Rucho, who was one of the architects of\n\nthe plan, told him that they had to ramp up the minority\n\nvoting percentage in the district to over 50 percent.\n\nSo that\u0027s the racial target at the starting point in\n\norder to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAnd then as counsel mentioned, we have that\n\ntarget being hit on the nose, 50.66 percent. And then\n\nwe have evidence, direct evidence, of the way that the\n\nState did it. And that came from the mapmaker.

SAHARSKY: Well, the -- the application\n\nof res judicata would depend on North Carolina law in\n\nthis instance because it was a case out of the North\n\nCarolina courts. And we don\u0027t have a position on the\n\napplication of North Carolina law. I\u0027m just saying that\n\nthe way that you deal with this question is through\n\napplication of the res judicata framework, as opposed to\n\ndoing something different like saying, now we won\u0027t use\n\nclear error anymore. We\u0027ll go to de novo review or\n\nsomething like that.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want us to apply\n\nres judicata to decide this question, and you don\u0027t have\n\na position on what the answer is?\n\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think if the Court\n\nworried about the State court having some effect, that\n\nit would ask there whether there was a res judicata bar.\n\nAnd there would be three hurdles, I think, that the\n\nState would have to overcome in order to prove -- in\n\norder to show that there was a res judicata bar: First\n\nof all, whether the argument was waived.

Any alternative map would have\n\neasy to do here, and they didn\u0027t do it.\n\nNow, they say they didn\u0027t do it in other\n\ncases as well, and I think there are two reasons that\n\nexplain that, neither of which reflect particularly well\n\non the idea we should get rid of the map requirement.\n\nOne reason they didn\u0027t do it is because in\n\nall of these cases, they thought that as long as they\n\ncould get the State to say, we had a BVAP floor of 50.1,\n\nor 55 point -- percent, we\u0027ve off the strict scrutiny\n\nland, so we don\u0027t need a map on predominance.\n\nThat\u0027s actually wrong, and I think this\n\nCourt will say that\u0027s wrong.\n\nThe second reason is, most of these\n\nchallenges are brought by people who are at least as\n\nconcerned about Democratic political prospects as they\n\nare about avoiding race. And the problem with putting\n\nan alternative map together is, should you actually\n\nprevail, those no-good, dirty Republicans on the other\n\nside could use the map and then say, well, look, you\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncan\u0027t really complain about that being a partisan\n\ngerrymander, because it was your map.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"61","file_name":"McCrory v.
