SULLIVAN: I just want to make the point\n\n21 that if the government has already intervened, which it\n\n22 didn\u0027t do in this case because three years of\n\n23 investigations found no fraud, if the government has\n\n24 already intervened, then Justice Ginsburg\u0027s dilemma will\n\n25 never occur. The government is already conducting the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n9\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 suit.\n\n2 So the only cases we\u0027re talking about in the\n\n3 small universe of cases that involve seal violations in\n\n4 the first place are non-intervened cases in which the\n\n5 government might not have intervened but want to do so\n\n6 later. And my point is there is no prejudice to the\n\n7 government or the treasury, because the government can\n\n8 come in later, relate back, and re-conduct the suit if\n\n9 it finds it\u0027s a meritorious case.\n\n10 JUSTICE KAGAN: You mentioned Hallstrom a\n\n11 couple of times --\n\n12 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n13 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and rely on it heavily in\n\n14 the briefs. But Hallstrom has very different statutory\n\n15 language. Hallstrom says no action may be commenced\n\n16 unless a condition is met.\n\n17 And, similarly, in 3730, the statute uses\n\n18 language that makes it clear that dismissal is\n\n19 appropriate when a mandatory requirement is not met.

And what I mean by that is, what was the\n\n14 1986 bargain?\n\nCongress wanted to encourage relators to\n\n15 come forward, and so it said, we\u0027re going to give you\n\n16 new, larger bounties and financial incentives. But\n\n17 we\u0027re worried that if we encourage you to come forward,\n\n18 you might impair government investigations. But we\n\n19 worry if we make you wait first before you file, you\n\n20 might lose your right to sue. You might have some other\n\n21 relator beat you to the post and file first, or the\n\n22 government might file and then you\u0027d be out of luck.\n\n23 So in order to protect the relators, the qui\n\n24 tam statute does it backwards from Hallstrom. It says\n\n25 file -- sorry -- file first, wait second. Whereas in\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n12\n\n1 Hallstrom, it accomplished the exact same purpose under\n\n2 RCRA: Wait first, file second.

ABC,\n\n13 the AP, and The New York Times are the public.\n\n14 Second, Your Honor, there may be other cases\n\n15 unlike this one in which it\u0027s a harder case, in which\n\n16 maybe someone just talked about fraud in the air.\n\n17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought the\n\n18 question was suppose these plaintiffs didn\u0027t reveal the\n\n19 complaint at all, but they described on a radio show, on\n\n20 a TV show, what they understood to be State Farm\u0027s\n\n21 practice. So the information came out, but not that\n\n22 they had filed the complaint.\n\n23 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, that would be a\n\n24 different case. You haven\u0027t reached it.

BASH: Well, let me take the general\n\n15 question and bring it to the facts here, and then talk\n\n16 about that question of the disparity about how courts\n\n17 are treating the different kinds of violations.\n\n18 The answer on the general question is they\n\n19 are both relevant. Under the standard articulated below\n\n20 and the standard we\u0027ve advocated, you look at both the\n\n21 actual harm to the government, just like often attempt\n\n22 crimes are not punished as strongly as crimes that\n\n23 actually result in harm, but you also look at the\n\n24 severity of the violation, and we think there\u0027s a direct\n\n25 correlation between the severity and the potential harm.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n43\n\n1 If you actually give the complaint to the defendant, the\n\n2 harm -- the potential harm is enormous. If you tell one\n\n3 person who is not affiliated with the defendant, the\n\n4 potential harm is less.

BASH: I think what Congress had in mind\n\n6 is defendants taking steps to thwart the government\n\n7 investigation; for example, destroying evidence,\n\n8 declining to cooperate once they know that there is a\n\n9 formal investigation of them. I think that\u0027s what\n\n10 Congress had in mind.\n\n11 I\u0027ll note, though, that the Senate Report,\n\n12 for those who look at that kind of thing, said that they\n\n13 expected -- that the Senate expected that there would\n\n14 not be many instances where a seal violation would harm\n\n15 the government. So I don\u0027t think it\u0027s surprising that\n\n16 this hasn\u0027t happened often.\n\n17 And Mr. Singh referred to the appendix in\n\n18 the petition that lists 48 cases that supposedly\n\n19 involved seal violations. Petitioner put that together\n\n20 obviously at the cert stage. Some of those don\u0027t even\n\n21 involve seal violations. I think they said they relate\n\n22 to the seal requirement.\n\n23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In your brief, you did\n\n24 say -- on page 27 of your brief, you said that\n\n25 reputational harm to the defendant could be relevant to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n46\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 determining a sanction for seal violation.\n\n2 MR.

And the reason I say\n\n4 idiosyncratic is, as we discussed, lower courts have\n\n5 held and we agree that merely disclosing the allegations\n\n6 of fraud does not violate the seal. So the sort of\n\n7 reputational harm you\u0027d be talking about is the\n\n8 incremental harm from the disclosure that a suit has\n\n9 been filed.\n\n10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You were going to tell us\n\n11 how to write the ideal platonic opinion?\n\n12 MR. BASH: I wouldn\u0027t presume to say the\n\n13 platonic opinion. But to the extent the Court seeks our\n\n14 recommendation in how to write the opinion, we think\n\n15 that the overall focus should be courts should remedy\n\n16 these seal orders like they always remedy protective\n\n17 orders and seal orders, with a healthy dose of\n\n18 discretion, but, in light of the purpose of this\n\n19 provision, to protect the government.\n\n20 More specifically, the three factors\n\n21 identified by the courts below: actual harm to the\n\n22 government; severity of the violation, which I think\n\n23 correlates with potential harm; and intent or bad faith\n\n24 are the three key factors in a mine run case. But we\n\n25 don\u0027t think the Court should exclude that in an\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n47\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 idiosyncratic case.

We think the Court could have dismissed this\n\n7 case here. We don\u0027t say that it would have been an\n\n8 abuse of discretion to dismiss the case here. And I\n\n9 think if the Court\u0027s worried about sending the signal\n\n10 that intentional violations don\u0027t matter, it could say\n\n11 the district court would have been perfectly within its\n\n12 discretion to dismiss here. If State Farm had sought\n\n13 additional sanctions, the Court would have been in its\n\n14 discretion to refer counsel to the bar or to impose\n\n15 other sanctions, but they didn\u0027t seek that here.\n\n16 And the abuse of discretion standard, we\n\n17 think, should be particularly robust in this context\n\n18 because the government relies on the relator. The\n\n19 suit\u0027s not dismissed. The government doesn\u0027t intervene.\n\n20 There is a trial of however many days, as Mr. Singh\n\n21 said.

Company\n\n51\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 And let me just remind you, in answer to\n\n2 your question, Justice Ginsburg, when will the\n\n3 government concede actual harm, it\u0027s not dispositive.\n\n4 It\u0027s dispositive if the government says there\u0027s actual\n\n5 harm, yes, or heavily weighted and possibly dispositive\n\n6 if they say it.\n\n7 But to remind you, as we point out on\n\n8 page 20 of our reply brief, the government hasn\u0027t\n\n9 admitted it was actually harmed, except in one case, the\n\n10 Le Blanc-ITT case, in 30 years. So you should not\n\n11 require actual harm. We agree with the government that\n\n12 potential harm, which is important, is captured by the\n\n13 severity factor, but that the lower courts misapplied\n\n14 the severity factor by looking to what risk transpired\n\n15 rather than what risk occurred at the time of the\n\n16 disclosure.\n\n17 As to whether that was a serious risk, I\n\n18 must respectfully disagree that there was no possible\n\n19 tip-off here from the news statements.
