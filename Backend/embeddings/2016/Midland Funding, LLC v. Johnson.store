Could you just -- you know,\n\njust from a commonsense basis, it seems hard to\n\nunderstand why Congress would want all these\n\nunenforceable proofs of claim to flow in, because only\n\ntwo things can happen. One is that the trustee will\n\nproperly filter out those claims; and the other is that\n\nthe trustee will be swamped and won\u0027t have the time or\n\nthe energy or the inclination or he\u0027ll make mistakes,\n\nand some of those claims will be deemed enforceable\n\nwhen, in fact, they\u0027re not.\n\nSo why would anybody want these proofs of\n\nclaim to flood into the bankruptcy system?\n\nMR. SHANMUGAM: So, Justice Kagan, two\n\nresponses to that. The first is that, again, you know,\n\nwe don\u0027t know that these claims are unenforceable. I\n\nthink what we know is that there is an apparent time bar\n\nto these claims. The very facts that are disclosed in\n\nthe proof of claim illustrate that.

And that\u0027s for\n\nthe simple reason that neither Davenport nor the later\n\ncases citing Davenport in any way purported to somehow\n\nexclude unenforceable rights from the definition of a\n\nclaim. In Davenport, everyone agreed that the right in\n\nquestion was enforceable in some respect. And the\n\nquestion was whether the fact that the enforcement\n\nmechanism was limited somehow affected whether or not it\n\ncame within the definition of claim, and the Court said\n\nno.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBut, again, if you thought that that rose to\n\nthe level of even a passing holding, I would return to\n\nthe language of the Bankruptcy Code and, in particular,\n\nthe definition of a claim which says nothing about\n\nenforceability.

Nothing\n\nin the bankruptcy gives a creditor an extra right to\n\njudicially enforce the debt.
