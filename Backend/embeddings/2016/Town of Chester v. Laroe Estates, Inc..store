very hard thing to do, in order for you to reverse the\n\ndecision below.\n\nBut here are some reasons why I think that\n\nthreshold inquiry makes sense at the front end. One, is\n\nthe Federal Court is already reviewing 24(a)(2)\n\nstandards at that point, and it\u0027s a very closely\n\nanalogous, if not exactly identical, set of questions.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n13\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd so it makes sense to do it all in one piece rather\n\nthan doing it separately.\n\nSecond, as my friend on the other side\u0027s\n\nbrief admits, there\u0027s no guarantee that that later\n\ninquiry will even happen. Indeed, his brief at page 30\n\nadmits that they kind of hope it doesn\u0027t happen, that\n\nsome extra related claims will come in. And that\u0027s\n\nparticularly so when it comes to, for example, Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 45 subpoenas, as to which the\n\ncourt doesn\u0027t often even find out about. They are just\n\nissued and the power of the Federal court is invoked.\n\nAnd so there might not be that later testing that would\n\noccur, unless you do it right at that front end.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could Congress -- could\n\nCongress enact a statute that provides for intervention\n\nof right for someone who doesn\u0027t satisfy Article III?\n\nThere are -- there are several statutes that do provide","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"12","file_name":"Town of Chester v.
