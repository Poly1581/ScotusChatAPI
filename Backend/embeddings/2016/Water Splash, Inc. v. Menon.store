GASTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nAt issue in this case is whether The Hague\n\nService Convention permits service of process by mail if\n\nthe State of destination does not object. Our position\n\nis that such mail service is allowed, and it\u0027s a\n\nthree-part argument.\n\nFirst, purely textual evidence of meaning\n\nshows that this reading of the treaty is at least\n\nreasonable.\n\nSecond, some additional considerations,\n\nnamely, this Court\u0027s decision in Schlunk, as well as the\n\nhistory of events leading up to the treaty, further\n\nconfirm that this is a reasonable reading of\n\nArticle 10(a).","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Water Splash, Inc. v.

GOLDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nArticle 10(a) of the Hague Service\n\nConvention permits service through postal channels on\n\npersons abroad if the law of the forum State -- that\u0027s\n\nthe State where the case is pending -- authorizes such\n\nservice and if the receiving State where the mail will\n\nbe delivered hasn\u0027t objected to Article 10(a).\n\nAnd I\u0027d like to start with this permit\n\nauthorize framework, because I think there\u0027s been a lot\n\nof confusion in the lower courts on this subject. The\n\nquestion presented here is perhaps phrased a little\n\ninartfully in terms of authorization, and it would be\n\nreally helpful if this Court would clarify this point.\n\nArticle 10(a) says that provided the State\n\nof destination does not object, the present convention\n\nshall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial\n\ndocuments by postal channels to persons abroad. So it\n\nis not interfering with freedom. It is -- it\u0027s not the\n\nsame thing as providing an affirmative authorization for\n\nservice by mail.

Addresser had been\n\nunderstood by everyone and it was clear in context to\n\ncapture service.

GASTON: On our blue brief at 32 and 33,\n\nI think it\u0027s clear, not only did the negotiator for the\n\nUnited States tell the Senate that this treaty involved\n\nservice -- allowed service by mail and the Executive\n\nBranch internally relayed that message to the -- to the\n\nPresident, so it\u0027s very clear internally that the\n\nUnited States Executive Branch understood that the\n\nUnited States\u0027 intent was that it allowed service by\n\nmail. Respondent makes a distinction between service of\n\nprocess and service of post-answer documents.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"45","file_name":"Water Splash, Inc. v.
