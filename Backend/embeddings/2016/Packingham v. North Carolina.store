GOLDBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\nplease the Court:\n\nThere are three principal features of North\n\nCarolina\u0027s law that make it a stark abridgement of the\n\nFreedom of Speech.\n\nFirst, Section 202.5 reaches vast swaths of\n\ncore First Amendment activity that is totally unrelated\n\nto the government\u0027s preventative purpose.\n\nMr. Packingham is not accused of communicating with or\n\nviewing the profile of a minor. He violated Section\n\n202.5 by speaking to his friends and family about his\n\nexperience in traffic court. And if today he were to\n\nview or respond to any of the thousands of Twitter\n\nmessages about his case in this Court, that would be a\n\nfelony.\n\nSecond, the law does not operate in some\n\nsleepy First Amendment quarter. It operates and forbids\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"1","file_name":"Packingham v.

certainly to sex\n\noffenders, such as the registry itself. As this Court\n\nin Smith v. Doe said that the registry was -- was\n\nconstitutional.

And this Court has recognized that they have\n\na high rate of recidivism and are very likely to do this\n\nagain. Even as late as 20 years from when they are\n\nreleased, they may recidivate.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- Mr. Montgomery, can I\n\nask you a question that has to do with the law\u0027s\n\nexemptions?
