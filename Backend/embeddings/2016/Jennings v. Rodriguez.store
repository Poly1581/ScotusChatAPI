GERSHENGORN\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n9 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\n10 may it please the Court:\n\n11 Congress provided extensive substantive and\n\n12 procedural protections for aliens whom the government\n\n13 wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the\n\n14 real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by\n\n15 providing for mandatory detention during removal\n\n16 proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens\n\n17 and aliens arriving at our shores.\n\n18 The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative\n\n19 balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance\n\n20 to require the government to release those aliens unless\n\n21 the government can prove by a preponderance of the\n\n22 evidence every six months that detention remains\n\n23 necessary.\n\n24 The Ninth Circuit\u0027s decision is a serious\n\n25 misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon.

that\u0027s really the way the Court should look at it here.\n\n2 And this, I think, was the insight in Justice Kennedy\u0027s\n\n3 concurrence in Demore. The amount of time increases\n\n4 here in part precisely because, as I indicated at the\n\n5 start, Congress has provided a substantial number of\n\n6 substantive and procedural protections for individuals:\n\n7 They have the right to lawyer at their own expense.\n\n8 They have the right to an interpreter. They have the\n\n9 right to present evidence and to gather evidence and to\n\n10 use subpoenas to get evidence. They can appeal to the\n\n11 BIA. They can appeal to the Court of Appeals.\n\n12 But with that process comes time. And I\n\n13 think a focus on just the length of time without the\n\n14 reasons for the delay, without looking at the fact that\n\n15 aliens routinely and understandably file for\n\n16 continuances, and to impose a rigid six-month rule like\n\n17 the Court of Appeals did is really a mistake.\n\n18 With respect to Demore, I really would like\n\n19 to address Your Honor\u0027s concern there on a number of\n\n20 situations. Your Honor is right that the statistics we\n\n21 provided to the Court were inaccurate, and we apologize.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"17","file_name":"Jennings v.

They lost it in the Ninth\n\n12 Circuit. They actually re-raised it in the summary\n\n13 judgment. They didn\u0027t seek review of it. So they have\n\n14 conceded both typicality and commonality for purposes of\n\n15 this proceedings.\n\n16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, but the decision of\n\n17 the Ninth Circuit was based on interpretation of this\n\n18 statute, and you want to go -- you want to -- you want\n\n19 to affirm on an alternative ground, which is that it\u0027s\n\n20 unconstitutional, so I don\u0027t know how far you can get\n\n21 with that argument.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"47","file_name":"Jennings v.

faith litigation of a substantial defense that, in the\n\n7 government\u0027s view, as I understand it, that\u0027s a\n\n8 sufficient justification for detention.\n\n9 And that is actually the most serious\n\n10 problem with their view on the Due Process Clause.\n\n11 Because if a person has a substantial defense and they\n\n12 are litigating that in good faith, that does not\n\n13 necessarily mean that their detention is serving a\n\n14 reasonable purpose. In fact, it\u0027s almost inversely\n\n15 correlated to it; right? I mean, if a person has a\n\n16 substantial defense, then it\u0027s far more likely that they\n\n17 are not a flight risk because they\u0027re going to want to\n\n18 go to immigration court to maintain their immigration\n\n19 status.\n\n20 And similarly, if a person has a substantial\n\n21 defense, that means they\u0027re not in a class of people\n\n22 that Congress wanted to mandate the deportation of,\n\n23 which probably means they have a less serious crime.
