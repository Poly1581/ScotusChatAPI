BERGERON: No, Justice Ginsburg. In\n\nfact, what the Court found ultimately was it recognized\n\nit did not resolve the question whether the Heat Rise\n\ntest was dispositive. And it said plaintiffs believe it\n\nwould be helpful, but it did not make a determination of\n\nthat. And in light of that, we had good-faith defenses\n\nas to even if the tests were produced, that there was\n\nstill a design defect. And beyond that, there were also\n\ncausation defenses as to the ultimate cause of the\n\naccident, whether that was driver error or whether there\n\nwas impact damage.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But weren\u0027t you given the\n\nopportunity -- maybe you can clarify this -- the -- the\n\nCourt said, well, if we\u0027re wrong about giving all of the\n\ncounsel fees, then we will deduct -- what? -- some\n\n$700,000 based on Goodyear\u0027s filing of the amount that\n\nshould not be recovered because it was unrelated to\n\nGoodyear\u0027s bad conduct.\n\nMR.

BERGERON: So what happened was before\n\nthe district court issued its November 2012 order, we\n\nhad raised -- they -- they had requested all sorts of\n\nremedies for sanctions, and we had raised the causation\n\npoint, the causation limitation. The district court\n\nrejected that in the November 2012 order and said, no,\n\nyou get everything.\n\nAnd so in response, the plaintiffs filed a\n\nthree-page fee application that said give us everything,\n\nalong with all of their time records.\n\nSo then in response to that, that\u0027s where we\n\nfiled our opposition and said, you know, that\u0027s where we\n\nraised the issue of -- of the 700,000 as being too far","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"7","file_name":"Goodyear Tire \u0026amp; Rubber Co. v.

And I\n\nthink if you look at all the sanction regimes, the\n\nburden is on the proponent to establish the propriety of\n\nthe award.\n\nThe legal answer is that Bagwell, although\n\nit doesn\u0027t squarely address this point, does seem to\n\nindicate that it is the proponent that needs to\n\nestablish the causation link.

I know.\n\nClearly it was not. But why shouldn\u0027t it have?\n\nMR. BERGERON: Well, because what Chambers\n\nwas recognizing was it did acknowledge that all of the\n\nfees were caused by the misconduct, and it did point out\n\nthat the entirety of the case was built on a fraud, and\n\nthere was no good faith defense to the litigation. So\n\nin that circumstance -- and, of course, the district\n\ncourt in Chambers says, this is unique. And it probably\n\nis a unique situation.\n\nBut then when we move to Bagwell, the other\n\npoint about Chambers is it was built on the foundation\n\nof contempt. And so it was built on the contempt cases\n\nin distilling a rule from those. But then that changed\n\nwith Bagwell because we have the clarification on the\n\ndistinction between criminal and civil, and Bagwell was\n\ndrawing that line at causation. And that\u0027s why, to the\n\nextent there is any tension between Chambers and\n\nBagwell, Bagwell should prevail on that point.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I to understand the\n\nquestion presented -- as presented was whether there is\n\na direct causation standard applicable to an award under\n\na court\u0027s inherent powers.

We did preserve in the\n\nfirst footnote of that filing that we were preserving\n\nour Miller argument which had been raised previously.\n\nMiller was a Ninth Circuit decision, they didn\u0027t impose\n\ndirect causation in our view.\n\nAnd so our point is we understand if you\n\ndisagree with us and say, we waive that; then that would\n\nbe the remedy. My point, though, is that because the\n\ndirect causation analysis was never done in the first\n\nplace, there would need to be a remand for that exercise\n\nto take place.\n\nAnd I think it\u0027s important as you look at\n\nwhat the district court found, and this gets back to,\n\nyou know, why is this not like Chambers.
