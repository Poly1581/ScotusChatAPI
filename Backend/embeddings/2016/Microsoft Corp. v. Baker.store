And so if that is\n\nthe case, we agree they are not moot, but then we go\n\nback to our finality argument.\n\nBut just to be precise about their argument\n\nin defense of mootness, they do not propound any\n\ncost-spreading or attorneys\u0027-fee-spreading argument,\n\nlike the one that was made in Roper. They do not make\n\nthat argument. The only argument they make is an\n\nargument that they would have the right to an incentive\n\naward if they -- if they prevailed.\n\nAnd there\u0027s two problems with that,\n\nMr. Chief Justice. The first is that only prevailing\n\nplaintiffs, according to lower courts, get an incentive\n\naward.

FISHER: Well, it might well be for a\n\ncouple of reasons, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, it\n\nis added as an empirical matter that the 1996 study\n\nthat\u0027s cited in the briefs that led to Rule 23(f) cites\n\nmultiple instances of plaintiffs going ahead in cases\n\nafter they\u0027ve been denied class certification. And so\n\nthere\u0027s a couple of reasons why they might do that; take\n\nthis case as an example.\n\nThe State laws under which they\u0027re trying to\n\nprevail on -- on the merits have fee shifting\n\nprovisions, and so the Court is quite familiar with\n\nscenarios where plaintiffs go ahead with low dollar\n\ncases or, indeed, no dollar cases with the prospect of\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n23\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfee shifting ahead. And, you know, that should not be\n\ntaken lightly. That\u0027s something the plaintiffs can use\n\nto their advantage.\n\nAlso, the key is whether the plaintiffs\n\nbelieve in their case, I think. If the plaintiffs\n\nbelieve in their case, I think there\u0027s every reason to\n\ngo ahead. The difficulty is, if the plaintiffs don\u0027t so\n\nmuch believe in their case, every incentive is to -- to\n\nhave litigation go the way this has, which is ten years","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"21","file_name":"Microsoft Corp. v.

And the reason\n\nwhy the committee thought it was in the teeth of Livesay\n\nwas, of course, because Livesay held that denials of\n\nclass certification are inherently interlocutory, and\n\nthat -- imagine the plaintiff themselves talked a lot\n\nabout how Livesay itself played out. Imagine if the\n\nplaintiff themselves in Livesay had gone back to\n\ndistrict court and said, now that we know from the\n\nSupreme Court we\u0027re not allowed to take interlocutory","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"59","file_name":"Microsoft Corp. v.

The first is, on the exact question here as to\n\nclass certification decisions, there\u0027s an old Second\n\nCircuit decision which has been called into doubt many\n\ntimes and never had anything done with it.\n\nAnd then the only other thing you have on my\n\nfriend\u0027s side is the Ninth Circuit case that immediately\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npreceded ours that brought this issue up to you. So\n\nuntil the Ninth Circuit allowed this a of couple years\n\nago, no court was allowing it in the class certification\n\nrealm.\n\nAnd the important thing to understand about\n\nthe other split, which he calls the bigger split of\n\ntaking it outside the class action, is all of those\n\ncases are predicated on the notion that the plaintiff\u0027s\n\nclaim has been destroyed on the merits. And that\u0027s\n\nwhere the Ninth Circuit made a wrong turn here.\n\nEven if you accept that, as I think you were\n\ncalling, Justice Sotomayor, a more flexible rule, this\n\ncase cannot possibly satisfy it, because what the Ninth\n\nCircuit missed is a denial of class certification has\n\nzero to do with the merits. And this Court has said\n\nthat over and over and over again.\n\nAnd so the phrase my friend used that he","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"62","file_name":"Microsoft Corp. v.
