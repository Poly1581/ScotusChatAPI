So you\u0027ve -- you\u0027ve\n\n11 gotten to the merits, but in the merits stage all you\u0027re\n\n12 talking about is this conversion claim. And so you\n\n13 could be adjudicated guilty even though nobody has\n\n14 decided, in fact, whether you violated international\n\n15 law. And that seems as though it cannot be right.\n\n16 MS.

And so you end up\n\n8 with a system where these issues are raised, legal\n\n9 issues going to the merits, but their whole ball of wax\n\n10 is now being put into the jurisdictional determination,\n\n11 going up and down, back and forth between the district\n\n12 court and the circuit. I really am not sure how that\n\n13 serves the sovereign\u0027s interests when it means that all\n\n14 of that has to be done before we can get to the\n\n15 straightforward legal merits determinations that -- that\n\n16 the court could decide once it concludes that it has\n\n17 jurisdiction.\n\n18 And I suspect it\u0027s for that reason that when\n\n19 Congress wrote this language, even though the Bell v.\n\n20 Hood standard had been long established, far before the\n\n21 FSIA was written, Congress didn\u0027t write anything in this\n\n22 statute to suggest, we want this one kind of\n\n23 determination, and this one determination only, to be\n\n24 done in a way that differs from how any other kind of\n\n25 jurisdictional determination of this type is made.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n47\n\n1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it\u0027s always a little","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"48","file_name":"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v.

That is an unusual jurisdictional rule, and it\u0027s\n\n23 not consistent with how Congress and the Executive\n\n24 Branch, when they were looking at these sorts of\n\n25 situations, and wanting to provide an open door to say\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n50\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 we\u0027re not opening the courthouse door only to winning\n\n2 claims.\n\n3 They\u0027re saying there has been a problem of\n\n4 foreign sovereigns taking property, for discriminatory\n\n5 reasons or without paying for it, using that property to\n\n6 gain advantage in the marketplace, and we want the\n\n7 courthouse doors to be open to that. There\u0027s no\n\n8 indication in the text, in the structure, or anywhere\n\n9 that says that\u0027s supposed to depart from how these\n\n10 decisions are normally made.\n\n11 And I want to address the Permanent Mission\n\n12 case which Ms. Goldenberg averted to where she, I think,\n\n13 correctly acknowledged that the only issue in that case\n\n14 was the character of the rights in issue as\n\n15 quote/unquote property.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"52","file_name":"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v.

STETSON\n\n23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n24 MS.\n\nSTETSON: Ms. Carroll describes this\n\n25 case as a subject matter jurisdiction case like any\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n58\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1 other. What this Court has already said in Altmann is\n\n2 that the FSIA is sui generis. Here, subject matter\n\n3 jurisdiction isn\u0027t just about jurisdiction over a class\n\n4 of cases or a type of case. It\u0027s jurisdiction over this\n\n5 sovereign standing in front of the Court. That is the\n\n6 difference between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). 12(b)(6)\n\n7 requires that court to have taken jurisdiction, to have\n\n8 exercised its power over that sovereign. Before that\n\n9 happens, it is the sovereign\u0027s prerogative to test\n\n10 jurisdiction.\n\n11 In answer, Justice Breyer, to your order --\n\n12 order of battle question, the sovereign sets the order\n\n13 of battle. This is -- the only order that this Court\n\n14 needs to give is the one that it already gave, frankly,\n\n15 in Verlinden, which is courts apply the substantive\n\n16 detailed FSIA standards to determine jurisdiction, not\n\n17 just to hypothesize it.\n\n18 The difference between this case and the\n\n19 Tucker Act is that in the Tucker Act, the jurisdiction\n\n20 depends on a claim against the United States.
