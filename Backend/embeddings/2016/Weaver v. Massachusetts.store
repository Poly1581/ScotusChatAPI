Did that cause\n\nprejudice or not, that the mother wasn\u0027t there? They\n\njust looked and there was a guy alone who was accused of\n\nkilling a 15-year-old, as opposed to a troubled youth\n\nwith his mother holding his hand.

Subject to Final Review\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O\u0027CONNELL\n\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\n\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\n\nMS. O\u0027CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nI\u0027d like to begin where my co-counsel just\n\nleft off here with the idea that any time a structural\n\nerror occurs, it leads to fundamental unfairness and\n\nunreliability in the outcome of the trial. Structural\n\nerrors implicate fairness in a way that\u0027s broader than\n\nthe interest that\u0027s protected by the Sixth Amendment\n\nright to the effective assistance of counsel.\n\nUnder Strickland, we\u0027re focused on whether\n\ncounsel\u0027s error undermines confidence in the -- in the\n\nverdict. You\u0027re asking whether there was such a\n\nbreakdown in the adversarial process that we can no\n\nlonger rely on what the jury did. And the Court in\n\nGonzalez-Lopez pushed back on the idea that all\n\nstructural errors are necessarily the type of error that\n\nundermine confidence in the reliability of the trial.\n\nAnd I can give three examples of scenarios\n\nwhere structural errors occur, where other courts have\n\nconcluded that those errors do not undermine the\n\nreliability of the trial outcomes: Batson errors, right\n\nto counsel of choice, and bias trial judge.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n43\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"43","file_name":"Weaver v.
