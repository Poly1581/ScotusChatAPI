Then --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I\u0027m sorry.\n\nHow does\n\nthat work with students whose disabilities generally\n\nwouldn\u0027t allow them in -- in their own -- with their own\n\npotential to follow the general educational curriculum?\n\nI understand how it worked in Rowley --\n\nMR. FISHER: Right.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where we were\n\ndealing with someone with a particular disability, but\n\none that was rather readily and easily addressed.\n\nMR. FISHER: Uh-huh.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here you have a very\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ndifferent context.

FISHER: Most likely not all the way up\n\nto grade level in this case, Mr. Chief Justice. But\n\nthat question, just as you asked me earlier, is\n\nexpressly answered in the statute.\n\nSo on page 52A, on the bottom of 52A in sub\n\nCC, what this -- what the IEP provisions say is that for\n\nchildren with disabilities who take alternate\n\nassessments aligned to alternate achievement standards,\n\na description of benchmarks or short-term objectives are\n\nappropriate. And then the rest of the IEP provisions\n\ndescribe how you set those goals to meet those alternate\n\nachievement standards.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2016","index":"5","file_name":"Endrew F. v.

matter\n\nhow expensive it would be and no matter what the impact\n\nin, let\u0027s say, a poor school district would be on the\n\ngeneral student population, cost can\u0027t be considered?\n\nAnd do you think in the real world, school boards are\n\ndisregarding costs entirely?\n\nMR. GORNSTEIN: So they\u0027re definitely not\n\ndisregarding costs entirely, because there could be two\n\ndifferent programs, both of which are reasonable, and\n\nthey would take into account costs, surely, in deciding\n\nwhich of those reasonable programs to adopt.\n\nBut more generally, I would say the answer\n\nis no in the usual case. And -- and from Cedar Rapids,\n\nthat\u0027s -- what the Court said is you consider cost in\n\ndeciding what the standard should be in the first place,\n\nbut cost can\u0027t define what the standards are.\n\nAnd that makes sense to me in -- in light of\n\nthe way you look at this statute. Congress obviously\n\nknew, when it passed this law, that there were going to\n\nbe some significant expenses associated with some kids,\n\nand that\u0027s why it gave money and made it an opt-in\n\nprogram.

Congress\u0027s whole\n\njudgment here was to put the emphasis on procedural\n\nprotections in the Act, and they bolstered them in \u002797\n\nand 2004. And as long as they could shine a light by\n\ncreating an IEP team process where they trusted teachers\n\nand they trusted parents who are highly incentivized to\n\ncome together --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but you\u0027re\n\nputting a lot -- you\u0027re assuming that the procedural\n\nprocess will yield significant results. What if they do\n\nthe whole thing? Yeah, we have a hearing. Everybody\n\ncomes in. We bring the expert in and the expert says,\n\nwell, you need to have somebody there six hours of the\n\nday to help the child learn, and they say, okay,\n\nthat\u0027s -- that\u0027s the procedure, we listen to you.

Yes, the IDEA has lots of\n\nprocedures in it, but they\u0027re all geared towards a\n\nparticular substantive result. And it\u0027s that\n\nsubstantive result that\u0027s the focus of the -- both the\n\nadministrative process and then judicial review of what\n\ncomes out of the administrative process.\n\nMR.

imposes.\n\nThe No Child Left Behind Act in 2004 was a\n\nvery important, revolutionary, bipartisan policy change.\n\nAnd so educators on the ground are aiming high, as they\n\nput it. The city\u0027s brief says we are aiming to maximize\n\nthe benefit for our students. And so you have a\n\ndisjoint between what educators are doing and the\n\ncourts. And the reason they need a kick is because the\n\nvery, very, very, very, very rare case that makes it\n\ninto the court system is not being properly reviewed.\n\nAnd that leaves the last point I want to\n\nrespond to, which is the fact that Congress left us\n\nalone after Rowley. What the Court has said in Rowley\n\nand in Honig and in other cases is the IEP rules are,\n\nquote, \"the centerpiece of the Act.\" They\u0027re the\n\ncenterpiece for how the education delivery services are\n\nput forward.\n\nIf you look at page 182 of Rowley, the IEP\n\nprovisions were quite hollow. They didn\u0027t have any\n\nbenchmarks at all. That has dramatically changed.
