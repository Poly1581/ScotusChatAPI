I think it\u0027s a\n\nrelatively limited provision.\n\nSo Section 349 says that -- that the default\n\nwhen a bankruptcy case is dismissed is that certain\n\ntransactions that occurred during the case, such as\n\navoidance actions, get unwound, liens that have been\n\nvoided are reinstated, and property remaining in the\n\nestate is returned to its prebankruptcy owner. In other\n\nwords, the bankruptcy is undone as far as possible.\n\nThe cause exception is an exception to that.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n15\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nSo what the cause exception permits a bankruptcy court\n\nto do is to maintain the status quo at the time of\n\ndismissal when there is good reason to do so.

And the other thing is the distribution of\n\nthe assets, but that\u0027s what the settlement provides for.\n\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, what the settlement\n\nshould provide for is basically a liquidation of a\n\nclaim. And so if you have a claim by the estate against\n\na third party, here a creditor, you basically reduce\n\nthat claim to a dollar amount, and those dollars become\n\nproperty of the estate.\n\nIf you have a settlement of a claim that\u0027s\n\nasserted by a creditor against the estate, then it\u0027s the\n\nsame kind of thing: You sort of liquidate the claim,\n\nyou reduce it to a dollar amount, and that becomes the\n\nclaim against the estate held by the creditor. But\n\nnothing in the Code would authorize -- and I think it\u0027s\n\na -- it would be a violation of the priority system and\n\ngenerally of the system that distributes estate assets\n\nto have parties agree on the side of how estate assets\n\nshould be distributed. Those estate assets are not the\n\nproperty of the debtor once the bankruptcy starts.\n\nThey\u0027re not the property of the creditors.
