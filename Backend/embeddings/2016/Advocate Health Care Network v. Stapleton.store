BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nPension plans for religious non-profits have\n\nbeen exempt from ERISA for over 30 years, whether or not\n\na church established the plan. And the contrary holding\n\nof the three courts below should be reversed for three\n\nreasons.\n\nFirst, the text does not require a church to\n\nestablish benefit plans for someone else\u0027s employees.\n\nSecond, the government\u0027s consistent view, over three\n\ndecades, has generated enormous reliance interest and\n\nwarrants deference. And third, affirmance would\n\nresurrect the precise problems that everyone understood\n\nthe 1980 amendment would fix.\n\nI could start with the text. And the main\n\ntext at issue here is subparagraph C(i) of section\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n1002(33).

I think the\n\nstatute in its current form is probably not the type of\n\nprovision that Congress would draft if it were doing the\n\nwhole thing in one fell swoop. But it\u0027s important to\n\nunderstand that the text of the -- the current provision\n\nis the combination of things that were done in 1974 and\n\nthings that were done in 1980.\n\nCongress enacted the original church plan\n\nprovision. Presumably, it had in mind particular plans\n\nthat were established and maintained by churches and it\n\ncovered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to\n\nlight. Other types of plans were found not to be\n\ncovered by the administrative agency that Congress\n\nevidently believed should be covered. And so when\n\nCongress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work\n\nwithin the existing framework. We\u0027re not quite sure\n\nwhy, but at least one plausible explanation would be\n\nthere were some church plans that had been found to be\n\ncovered under the old \"established and maintained by a\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nchurch\" language.
