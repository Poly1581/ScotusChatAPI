by a little bit.\n\nTaken seriously, that test requires\n\nparties and courts to disentangle competing\n\npurposes and to identify the single most\n\nimportant one.

I think Justice\n\nSotomayor\u0027s point is a bigger and broader one.\n\nI mean, we\u0027ve had the attorney-client\n\nprivilege for a long time, and until 2014,\n\nnobody ever suggested that the test that you\u0027re\n\nproposing is the right one.  Everybody instead\n\nused the primary purpose test.\n\nSome used it explicitly, you know,\n\nthis was one purpose, this was another purpose.\n\nSome didn\u0027t.

Because, by\n\ndefinition, if there is a primary purpose\n\nthat\u0027s non-legal driving the communication,\n\nsomebody will make that communication because\n\nthey have a non-legal primary purpose to do so.\n\nSo this is a big ask, and it\u0027s an ask\n\nthat\u0027s not particularly consistent with the\n\nunderlying nature of what the attorney-client\n\nprivilege is supposed to be protecting.\n\nMR.

Otherwise, the\n\nkinds of communications that have to happen and\n\nthat would be available to court proceedings\n\nwould all become hidden.\n\nAnd I guess just to give one\n\nreal-world example of that, the one court that\n\nwe view as actually adopting a freestanding\n\nsignificant purpose test is the D.C. Court of\n\nAppeals, and in the Moore decision, which we\n\ncite on page 30 of our brief, the D.C. Court of\n\nAppeals relied on the significant purpose test\n\nto overturn a criminal threats conviction for a\n\ncriminal defendant who in a prior proceeding\n\nhad told his attorney, his defense counsel\n\nthat, to paraphrase, he hated the prosecutor\n\nand planned to kill her.\n\nAnd the D.C.
