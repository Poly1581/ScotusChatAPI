THOMPSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Elections Clause requires state\n\nlegislatures specifically to perform the federal\n\nfunction of prescribing regulations for federal\n\nelections.  States lack the authority to\n\nrestrict the legislatures\u0027 substantive\n\ndiscretion when performing this federal\n\nfunction.\n\nAs Alexander Hamilton wrote in\n\nFederalist 78, the scope of legislative\n\nauthority is governed by the commission under\n\nwhich it is exercised.  Here, that commission is\n\ncontained in the United States Constitution, and\n\nit is federal law alone that places substantive\n\nrestrictions on states\u0027 legislatures performing\n\nthe tasks assigned them by the federal\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Moore v.

States\n\nlike Delaware and Maryland and Mississippi\n\nexpressly regulated federal elections, as did\n\nthree quarters of the states.\n\nThird, New York in 1792, this example\n\nis really important, I think it\u0027s truly action\n\nas opposed to the talk from Schuyler and Justice\n\nStory. In 1792, the Council of Revision, which\n\nhas four people on it, three judges, one\n\ngovernor, vetoed a federal elections bill for\n\nthe selection of delegates to the House of\n\nRepresentatives.  It was a time, place, manner\n\nthing.

So the separate opinion that was\n\nwritten in this case earlier, all those\n\narguments, I take it, are now off the table\n\nabout the North Carolina court going too far or\n\nmisreading its own constitution.\n\nFor us, Mr. Chief Justice, because\n\nthis Court has never really confronted the\n\nsituation of saying a state court got it wrong\n\non its own constitution, we think that standard\n\nhas to be sky high.  It is the, you know,\n\nultimate affront to sovereignty of a state to\n\nsay its own state court got things wrong.\n\nAnd we\u0027d say the corollary is it\u0027s an\n\nequal affront to say a state can\u0027t even have\n\nthese clauses in its constitution, that they\u0027re\n\nunenforceable.  You know, things like the Free\n\nElections Clause have been around since 1776 in\n\nNorth Carolina.

I just want to make sure this -- that\n\nthis -- we all keep this in mind: They are not\n\nmaking an argument that the -- that the North\n\nCarolina Supreme Court\u0027s decision in this case\n\nwould be struck down under the standard I\n\narticulated or any other standard. In fact,\n\nthey began their argument, and they said, I\n\nthink, by my count, six or seven times that they\n\naccept the North Carolina Supreme Court\u0027s\n\ndecision as a fair reading of North Carolina\n\nlaw. So whatever the Court concludes with\n\nrespect to the application of that -- the -- the\n\n-- the need for a standard like this, it\u0027s\n\nnot -- it\u0027s not a basis to overturn the decision\n\nhere for -- for the reasons I identified.\n\nNow, with respect to Your Honor\u0027s\n\nquestion, I think I would -- the way I read the\n\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court decision is a\n\nlittle different, starting with the fair -- the\n\nFree Elections Clause.  It basically, as I read\n\nthe opinion, conducted a historical analysis of\n\nthe kind that should be familiar as a matter of\n\nconstitutional interpretation.

proposed\n\nabout looking at the federal function.\n\nIn Smiley, the Court said that\u0027s not\n\nwhat you look at. You look at the specific\n\nfunction that\u0027s been assigned.  And when it\u0027s a\n\nlaw-making function, that carries with it the\n\nordinary checks and balances that apply to state\n\nlaw, including those applied by the state\n\nconstitution.\n\nThat was the very distinction the\n\nCourt draw -- drew with Hawke versus Smith and\n\nthe separate ratification function.  That\u0027s a\n\ndifferent question.  And cases like Leser that\n\nhe\u0027s repeatedly relied on are looking at a\n\ndifferent function under the Constitution.\n\nBut, with law-making, the relevant\n\nfact is that the Framers would have understood\n\nthat that comes with it judicial review and\n\nstate constitutional constraints, both\n\nsubstantive and procedural.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Because the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"156","file_name":"Moore v.

We don\u0027t think that there is\n\na --\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Just on your side of\n\nthe podium.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Sadly, yes.  I\n\nthink that it wouldn\u0027t make sense to deploy a\n\ndifferent standard or formulation with respect\n\nto statutory and constitutional questions\n\nbecause, again, you\u0027d be testing for the same\n\nthing, when is this not the court acting like a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n187\n\nOfficial\n\ncourt when it has gone off the rails and it\u0027s\n\njust doing policy under the guise of statutory\n\ninterpretation or constitutional interpretation.\n\nBut I agree with Mr. Verrilli that I\n\nthink, in application, this could often come out\n\ndifferently in the sense that usually in\n\nstatutory interpretation you have a text before\n\nyou and it might be more evident whether this is\n\njust a stark departure from the legislature\u0027s\n\nwork.\n\nIn the context of constitutional\n\nadjudication and contrast, there are often broad\n\nprovisions, as there are under the federal\n\nConstitution, and I think that federal courts\n\nshould not be in the business of saying that the\n\nstate courts aren\u0027t giving those, for example,\n\njust a fair reading looking at their text alone\n\nbecause there is often a lot of additional\n\nmethodology that has to go into properly\n\ninterpreting those provisions and distilling\n\nthem into principles and concrete cases.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"167","file_name":"Moore v.
