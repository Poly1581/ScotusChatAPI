GEYSER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe government lacks the statutory\n\nauthority to dismiss a False Claims Act case\n\nafter declining to proceed with the action, and\n\nthat conclusion follows directly from the Act\u0027s\n\nplain text, structure, history, and purpose.\n\nRespondents\u0027 contrary view reads the\n\nAct\u0027s dismissal authority in isolation.  It\n\nmakes nonsense of the Act\u0027s deliberate\n\nstructure.  It renders key clauses superfluous,\n\nwhich Respondents concede.  And it requires\n\nlimiting the relator\u0027s status and rights where\n\nthe Act unambiguously says the court may not\n\nlimit the relator\u0027s status and rights.\n\nWhen the FCA was enacted in 1863, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\ngovernment could not intervene at all.

It seems as though the\n\nhistory of the statute is pretty clear that\n\nCongress only amended it to allow for later\n\nintervention because it was concerned that the\n\ngovernment didn\u0027t have an opportunity to\n\nintervene after the initial period.

this is\n\nsort of in line with my colleagues suggesting\n\nthat they wanted the government to be able to\n\ncome back in and take over the case if things\n\nhad changed or the circumstances were

GEYSER: Sure.  Well, just to be\n\nclear, it is not an all-or-nothing choice\n\nanymore, and our theory is perfectly consistent\n\nwith what Congress did in 1986.  Before 1986,\n\nthe government couldn\u0027t intervene in the case\n\nafter the fact.  After 1986, the government can\n\nintervene.\n\nNow it can\u0027t intervene and proceed\n\nwith the action.  Congress said only intervene\n\nin (c)(3) and it said they can do it with good\n\ncause. And they said, importantly, they can do\n\nit without affecting, without limiting the\n\nstatus and rights of the relator.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  I\u0027m sorry, so what\u0027s\n\nthe purpose of the intervention then if they","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"10","file_name":"U.S., ex rel.

It\n\nshows that where Congress wanted to limit the\n\nrelator\u0027s rights, whether or not the government\n\nproceeds with the action, it said so.\n\nAnd the dismissal rights are not found\n\nin (c)(4).  In fact, the government concedes and\n\nthe private Respondent concedes that that\n\nreading renders surplusage the introductory\n\nphrase of (c)(4).  It also renders superfluous\n\nthe final sentence of (c)(1), which says that\n\nthe relator can still participate where the\n\ngovernment does proceed with the case subject to\n\nthe limitations of paragraph 2.

So -- and Rule\n\n41, again, is usually activated without any sort\n\nof hearing.

The purpose of intervention under\n\nthe statute is for the government to become a\n\nplaintiff in the case, and the point of becoming\n\na plaintiff in the -- in the case is so that the\n\ngovernment can assume the -- the rights and\n\nburdens of being a full party in the case, the\n\nrights being the ability to file motions, to\n\nexamine witnesses, to direct the presentation of\n\nevidence, the burdens being the burdens under\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as they\n\npertain to discovery.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  But not the right to\n\nsettle the claim?  I mean, you say repeatedly\n\nthat the government doesn\u0027t have to intervene\n\nand they can still settle this claim.\n\nMR. LIU: Well, my point is none of\n\nthose rights or burdens matters if the whole\n\npoint of the government\u0027s motion is to end the\n\ncase. The only reason intervention matters is\n\nif we want to proceed with the case, and it\n\nmatters what our rights are, what our burdens\n\nare going forward.

Now, of\n\ncourse, that question\u0027s, why is there a hearing?\n\nThe normal reason for having a hearing is to\n\nsecond-guess what the government is saying.\n\nAnd, in fact, it is equivalent to\n\nsaying that because I feel like it if the\n\ngovernment can come up with any reason at all\n\nand not have to justify the reason, even if it\u0027s\n\nclearly arbitrary and clearly incorrect.\n\nThe government has also said that --\n\nthat second-guessing would not be subject to\n\njudicially manageable standards.
