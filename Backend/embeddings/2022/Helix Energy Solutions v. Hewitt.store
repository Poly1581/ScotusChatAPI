CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nRespondent earned over $200,000 a year\n\nand concededly performed executive functions in\n\nsupervising a dozen or more workers.

That\u0027s how I see it.\n\nAnd let me tell you why I think it\n\nmatters, because the regularity of a\n\npredetermined amount is how people pay\n\nmortgages.
