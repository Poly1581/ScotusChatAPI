We\n\nknow that from both the historical practice of\n\ncompacting at the time and the circumstances of\n\nthis compact.\n\nThe history and tradition of compacts\n\nleading to 1953 shows the prevailing\n\nunderstanding that unilateral termination is not\n\nallowed unless the compact expressly grants that\n\npower.

rules, contract law and state\n\nsovereignty, both well established by the 19th\n\nCentury, allow New Jersey to withdraw.\n\nIndeed, under this Court\u0027s cases,\n\nincluding those cases involving

particular res. Those agreements are\n\npresumptively permanent, meaning that states\n\ncannot withdraw from agreements settling\n\nboundaries or settling water rights.\n\nOn the other hand, as New York has\n\nconceded this morning, contracts of continuing\n\nperformance are different, that in the face of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n56\n\nOfficial\n\nsilence, parties can withdraw from agreements\n\nthat would otherwise require them to keep\n\nperforming forever.\n\nThis compact is precisely the sort of\n\narrangement from which parties can presumptively\n\nwithdraw.

It has other attributes.

I\n\nthink a contrary rule would require legislatures\n\nto guess if enough time has passed before they\n\nstart exercising their own authority, and that\u0027s\n\nnever been applied to government contracts.\n\nThe second point I\u0027ll make about that\n\nis that a reasonable time requirement, which\n\nwould be the only sort of contrary rule, would\n\nbe one that really only applies when you have\n\nasymmetrical bargaining, as in a distribution\n\nagreement, and one party had to do specific\n\nupfront costs the other party didn\u0027t have to do.\n\nThe Second Circuit\u0027s case in Compania talks\n\nabout this.

I\n\n-- I mentioned that I think it points the same\n\ndirection, and in Tarrant, the Court unanimously\n\nadopted the sovereignty presumption.\n\nBut, if you want to go just the\n\ncontract route, I think that would be perfectly\n\nfine. You could say this isn\u0027t a case like\n\nAlabama versus North Carolina, where we would be\n\nusing an implied contract rule to overcome the\n\nclear text of a federal statute.\n\nYou would just say, look, there\u0027s\n\nsilence here.  We have said over and over,\n\nincluding in New York versus New Jersey, that\n\nbackground common law rules speak into the\n\nsilence of a compact.  And I think that would\n\nbasically be the end of the analysis.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Why should we not look\n\nto rules of statutory interpretation?  Statutes\n\ngenerally remain in effect until they are --\n\nthey remain in effect until they\u0027re repealed.\n\nThey don\u0027t have sunset provisions.\n\nMR. RAYNOR: Yes, Justice Alito.
