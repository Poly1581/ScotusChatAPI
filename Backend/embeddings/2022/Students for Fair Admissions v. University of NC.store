A century of\n\nresistance to race neutrality followed, but this\n\nCourt\u0027s landmark decision in Brown finally and\n\nfirmly rejected the view that racial\n\nclassifications have any role to play in\n\nproviding educational opportunities.\n\nSince then, the Court has broadly\n\nenforced the Constitution\u0027s prohibition on the\n\nuse of racial classifications.

This Court should overrule it.\n\nFirst, Grutter is grievously wrong.\n\nIts view that the educational benefits of\n\ndiversity justify racial classifications\n\ncontradicts the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s guarantee\n\nof equal treatment. It relied upon\n\nstereotypical assumptions that race is\n\nnecessarily a proxy for one\u0027s viewpoint, and its\n\npurported limits are empty and\n\nself-contradictory, which is why UNC simply\n\nignores them.\n\nGrutter also creates many negative\n\neffects.  Some applicants are incentivized to\n\nconceal their race. Others who were admitted on\n\nmerit have their accomplishments diminished by\n\nassumptions that their race played a role in\n\ntheir admission.  And there is no evidence that\n\nafter two decades Grutter has somehow reduced\n\nthe role of race on campus.\n\nFinally, no one is actually relying on\n\nGrutter.  The opinion forecast its own demise\n\nand it made clear that race-based admissions\n\nmust be diminishing over time.

UNC officials testified that they\n\ncannot imagine any scenario that would actually\n\nlead them to end their racial preferences.  UNC\n\nclaims license to use race in perpetuity, and\n\nthe district court held that Grutter allows\n\nthis.\n\nRacial classifications are wrong, and\n\nthis Court should overrule Grutter.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"3","file_name":"Students for Fair Admissions v.

So the most\n\nconcrete possible scenario is -- is stock\n\ntrading, and there are studies that find that\n\nracially diverse groups of people making trading\n\ndecisions perform at a higher level, make more\n\nefficient trading decisions.  And the mechanism\n\nthere is that it reduces group think and people\n\nhave longer and more sustained disagreement, and\n\nthat leads to a more efficient outcome.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I guess I don\u0027t\n\nput much stock in that because I\u0027ve heard\n\nsimilar arguments in favor of segregation too.\n\nI\u0027d like to go to something different,\n\nto deference in the area as of a compelling\n\ninterest.

From the Sweatt and Brown cases\n\nthrough Bakke and Grutter, this Court has\n\nrecognized the paramount roles that integrated\n\neducation and cross-racial interactions play in\n\nbuilding a true democracy, where pathways to\n\nleadership are visibly open to all qualified\n\ncandidates.\n\nBrown attempted to shut down this\n\nnation\u0027s terrible caste system, but stark racial\n\ninequalities persisted and stunted this nation\u0027s\n\ngrowth.  Enter Bakke and Grutter, which have\n\nhelped universities open the doors of\n\nopportunities to highly qualified students of\n\ncolor, who are often overlooked in a process\n\nthat typically undervalues their talents and\n\nperspectives.\n\nRacial diversity and its attending\n\nsocial and academic benefits help all students\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n118\n\nOfficial\n\nto be better prepared to work and live together\n\nand make this nation better as a whole.

One\n\n-- one difference between your brief and your\n\nposition and University of North Carolina\u0027s is\n\nthat from the student\u0027s perspective -- and you\n\nwere getting at this in some of your answers to\n\nJustice Sotomayor early on about Confederate\n\nstatues and the presence of white supremacist\n\ngroups -- is that from the student perspective,\n\nyou know, students -- the educational benefit to\n\nthe students might be in the form of\n\ncounteracting feelings of isolation, sticking\n\nout, not being supported.\n\nIn light of that, I\u0027m wondering if you\n\nhave anything to say about affinity groups and\n\naffinity housing?\n\nI think one thing at least insofar as\n\nI\u0027m aware at the time Grutter was decided and\n\ncertainly Bakke, that kind of a phenomenon where\n\nyou have groups, say, where, you know, Black\n\nstudents and allies can live or, you know, Black\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n140\n\nOfficial\n\nstudent groups, same for, you know, Hispanic\n\ngroups, et cetera, was not a phenomenon that was\n\naround then.\n\nAnd -- and I think one of the benefits\n\nis that it allows minority students to band\n\ntogether to reduce some of the feelings of\n\nisolation that you\u0027ve been talking about.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"124","file_name":"Students for Fair Admissions v.

And the\n\nevidence also bears it out at Petition Appendix\n\n78, where the evidence showed that hundreds of\n\nwhite students with lower combined GPAs and SAT\n\nscores were admitted ahead of higher-performing\n\nBlack students, Latinx students, who went to\n\nUNC.

PRELOGAR:  We\u0027re not asking\n\nthe Court to draw that distinction.\n\nAnd our\n\ninterest here, I think, does extend more broadly\n\nto other federal agencies, to the federal\n\ngovernment\u0027s employment practices itself, and to\n\nhaving a set of leaders in our country who are\n\ntrained to succeed in diverse environments.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Well, then I don\u0027t\n\nunderstand the relevance of what you\u0027re saying\n\nabout the link between college education either\n\nat a service academy or a school with an ROTC\n\nprogram and the needs of the military if -- if\n\nit doesn\u0027t matter whether the school has no ROTC\n\nprogram and therefore trains no officers.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, Justice\n\nAlito, I was trying to focus on the specific\n\nquestion I understood the Chief Justice to be\n\nasking about the military\u0027s critical interest in\n\nthis context and just trying to make the point\n\nthat it\u0027s not just confined to the

would point to, I think, three\n\noverarching categories or ways to try to measure\n\nprogress toward the goal.\n\nThe first can be\n\nquantitative or objective evidence.  I\u0027ll use\n\nthe service academies again as another example.\n\nOne of the things they have looked at\n\nand measured is the disparities in graduation\n\nand attrition rates.  And the Coast Guard\n\nAcademy, for example, discovered when it went to\n\nCongress in the early 2000s to try to ask\n\nCongress to lift the ban on the use of race in\n\nadmissions, which Congress did in 2010, what the\n\nCoast Guard Academy said is it had studied the\n\nissue with respect to women and discovered that\n\nwhen enrollment of women stabilized at about 25\n\nto 30 percent of the population, those\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n171\n\nOfficial\n\ndisparities of -- of women not graduating in the\n\nsame -- at the same rate as men fell by the\n\nwayside and disappeared.

And I think that the UNC record\n\nreally illustrates this point, that UNC has held\n\nitself to the standards this Court has\n\narticulated in using race as only one of a\n\nmultitude of factors in holistic admissions and\n\ndeploying race-neutral alternatives and not\n\nusing race when it\u0027s not necessary to achieve\n\ntrue student body diversity.\n\nAnd -- and maybe that means that given\n\nthe limited way that race functions, it is\n\ntaking longer for our society to get to the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n178\n\nOfficial\n\npoint that everyone agrees we will eventually\n\nreach, but I don\u0027t think that that\u0027s a basis to\n\ncondemn Grutter now and halt progress in its\n\ntracks.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\nGeneral.\n\nMr. Strawbridge, rebuttal?\n\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK STRAWBRIDGE","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"157","file_name":"Students for Fair Admissions v.
