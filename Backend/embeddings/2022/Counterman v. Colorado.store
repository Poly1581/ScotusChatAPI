ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis Court has long held that because\n\nof the importance of free speech in our country,\n\ncategorical exceptions to the First Amendment\u0027s\n\nprohibition on content regulations must be well\n\ndefined and narrowly limited, and speech cannot\n\nbe exempted without proof of a long-settled\n\ntradition of subjecting that speech to\n\nregulation.\n\nThe State has not come close to\n\nmeeting its burden of showing a long-settled\n\ntradition of punishing true threats without\n\nproof the speaker knew that his statement would\n\ncause fear.

The best it can do is\n\ncite cases that were silent about the required\n\nintent in the face of unambiguous threats.\n\nThe State tries to conjure a tradition\n\nof -- of punishing negligent threats by analogy\n\nto other categorical exceptions. But,\n\ngenerally, they require at least recklessness.\n\nThe closest analogue, incitement, requires\n\nspecific intent.\n\nAt bottom, any claim of a settled\n\ntradition of criminalizing negligent threats is\n\nimpossible to square with Virginia versus Black,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Counterman v.

WEISER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. WEISER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nTrue threats have always been\n\nprosecuted without protection by the First\n\nAmendment.  Petitioner now seeks to impose a\n\nspecific intent element onto this inquiry that\u0027s\n\nrequired neither by history nor precedent.\n\nDoing so would enable more harm and\n\nless valuable discourse.  That\u0027s because a\n\nserious expression of an intent to cause\n\nunlawful physical violence directly causes\n\nlife-changing harms and does not contribute to\n\nthe marketplace of ideas, regardless of what the\n\nperpetrator was thinking.\n\nRequiring specific intent in cases of\n\nthreatening stalkers would immunize stalkers who\n\nare untethered from reality.  It would also\n\nallow devious stalkers to escape accountability\n\nby insisting that they meant nothing by their\n\nharmful statements.\n\nThis matters because threats made by\n\nstalkers terrorize victims and for good reason.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"46","file_name":"Counterman v.

We haven\u0027t seen in\n\nthe last 50 years with this objective rule the\n\ntypes of harms.

And the stalking context here, like\n\nmany stalking situations, has someone who\n\nbelieves they\u0027re entitled to the attention and\n\nthe affection of a victim.\n\nVictims of stalking routinely face\n\nscores and scores, hear hundreds and hundreds of\n\nunwanted, invasive engagements from somebody,\n\nand the consequence in stalking cases is, if you\n\ndon\u0027t give me what I want, I can turn violent,\n\nand that, indeed, does happen a significant\n\namount of the time.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
