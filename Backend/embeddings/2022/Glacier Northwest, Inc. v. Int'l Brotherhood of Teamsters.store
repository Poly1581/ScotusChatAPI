ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. FRANCISCO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Court and the Board have long\n\nrecognized that the intentional destruction of\n\nan employer\u0027s property in the course of a labor\n\ndispute is not protected concerted activity.\n\nThat\u0027s why steelworkers can\u0027t walk out in the\n\nmiddle of a molten iron pour.  It\u0027s why federal\n\nsecurity guards can\u0027t leave their posts in the\n\nmiddle of a terrorist threat.  It\u0027s why a\n\nferryboat crew can\u0027t drive their boat out into\n\nthe middle of the river and abandon ship.  And\n\nit\u0027s why in this very case the government\n\nagrees that the conduct alleged in this\n\ncomplaint isn\u0027t even arguably protected.\n\nThe more substantial question then is,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nwho gets to decide whether the facts alleged in\n\nthe complaint are true?

If the facts alleged aren\u0027t\n\neven arguably protected, then the court decides\n\nthe facts. If the allegations are true, it can\n\naward relief.  And if they\u0027re not, the claim\n\nfails, either because it\u0027s preempted or because\n\nit fails under state law.\n\nThis division of authority makes\n\nsense. Garmon held that the Board\u0027s interests\n\nin ensuring a uniform legal interpretation of\n\nthe statute is sufficient to override the\n\nstate\u0027s interests in adjudicating state tort\n\nclaims, but it doesn\u0027t have a similar interest\n\nin resolving the facts.\n\nSo, if the complaint alleges clearly\n\nunprotected conduct and the only issue is\n\nwhether those allegations are true, the state\n\ncourt gets first crack at resolving the facts.\n\nThat\u0027s probably why in this very case the\n\nregional director didn\u0027t even file his\n\ncomplaint until after the Washington Supreme\n\nCourt\u0027s decision, instead of at the outset,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n6\n\nOfficial\n\nwhich, under the union\u0027s view, would have\n\nprevented four years of wasteful litigation.\n\nThe Court should therefore reverse the\n\ndecision below and allow the state courts to\n\nadjudicate Glacier\u0027s non-preempted state court\n\ncomplaint.\n\nAnd I\u0027d be happy to address any\n\nquestions Your Honors may have.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"3","file_name":"Glacier Northwest, Inc. v.

I think,\n\nprincipally, because it\u0027s contrary to how\n\npreemption works in virtually every other\n\ncontext.  State courts are not typically ousted\n\nof jurisdiction to adjudicate tort claims, even\n\nin highly regulated areas.\n\nInstead, they adjudicate the tort\n\nclaim.  But they\u0027re still bound by federal law.\n\nSo, if it appears that the claim conflicts with\n\nfederal law, they grant a preemption defense.\n\nUnder Garmon, if it appears that it arguably\n\nconflicts with federal law, they grant a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial\n\npreemption defense.

Why -- why -- why is that\n\nnot sufficient to address your concerns?\n\nMR. FRANCISCO:  Well, Your Honor, it\n\n-- it\u0027s not that I have a problem with the\n\nBoard\u0027s test.

And I would point you to\n\nthe Board\u0027s decision in the International\n\nProtective Services case, which helps\n\nillustrate this.

SURI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nI wonder if I could begin with the\n\nline of questioning that seems to have taken up\n\nmost of the morning so far -- namely, this\n\ndistinction between factual and legal issues --\n\nand explain why it is that we think even the\n\nfactual issues should be resolved by the Board.\n\nThere are both legal and practical\n\nreasons for so holding, and contrary to what\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\nMr. Francisco has said, I don\u0027t think the Bill\n\nJohnson\u0027s decision stands in the way of that.\n\nIf I could start with the legal\n\nreasons, the first and most important legal\n\nreason is this Court\u0027s decision in Longshoremen\n\nagainst Davis. In that case, the Court said\n\nthat Garmon preemption is established when the\n\nparty asserting preemption presents evidence\n\nfrom which the Board could reasonably conclude\n\nthat the conduct is protected.\n\nAnd it separated that from a separate\n\nbasis for establishing preemption; namely, the\n\nparty can offer a legal interpretation that the\n\nBoard could reasonably accept.  So I think that\n\ndecision pretty squarely establishes that the\n\nBoard is meant to resolve factual as well as\n\nlegal disputes.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"41","file_name":"Glacier Northwest, Inc. v.

I think that\n\ndecision pretty squarely establishes that the\n\nBoard is meant to resolve factual as well as\n\nlegal disputes.\n\nAnd that\u0027s consistent with the\n\nstructure of the statute.  If you look at\n\nSections 10(e) and 10(f) of the National Labor\n\nRelations Act, those provisions say that the\n\nBoard makes factual findings to be resolved\n\nunder the substantial evidence standard.  That\n\nsuggests that Congress wanted the Board to make\n\nthese factual decisions as well as the legal\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\nones.\n\nAnd as for the practical reasons, if\n\nthe state court gets the law wrong, then it\n\nwon\u0027t be finding the right facts.  In other\n\nwords, if it misunderstands what the Board\u0027s\n\nprecedents require in a particular area, then\n\nit may focus on immaterial facts or ignore the\n\nmaterial facts.\n\nAnd, finally, just as an\n\nadministrative matter, it\u0027s going to be very\n\ndifficult to draw lines between mixed\n\nquestions, legal questions, and factual\n\nquestions.  It\u0027s much easier simply to adopt a\n\nclear rule that the Board resolves these\n\narguable cases.\n\nNow Mr. Francisco says that the Bill\n\nJohnson\u0027s decision supports his position, and I\n\ndon\u0027t think that\u0027s right.  The issue in Bill\n\nJohnson\u0027s is, under what circumstances can\n\nsomeone be punished simply for bringing a\n\nlawsuit?

is not a mere\n\nstoppage of work.\n\nPoint two, my friend from the\n\ngovernment relied on the Longshoremen against\n\nDavis case.  That case did not involve any\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n93\n\nOfficial\n\ndisputed facts.  That was a case about the\n\ndifference between -- the meaning of the words\n\n\"supervisors\" versus \"employees.\"  The union\n\nnever put in any evidence at all that the --\n\nthat the people at issue fell within the -- I\n\n-- I think it was the -- the -- the employee\n\ncategory. And the Court simply said that on\n\nthe basis of the facts as we have them, it\u0027s an\n\narguable question.  That\u0027s exactly how we think\n\nthat the Court ought to proceed in this\n\ncontext.\n\nThe only case -- and this is my third\n\npoint -- the only case that this Court has\n\nissued that comes close to addressing these\n\nfacts is the Bill Johnson decision, where you\n\ndid have a complaint on the one hand in state\n\ncourt alleging malicious libel, clearly\n\nunprotected conduct, and you had a Board\n\nfinding on the other hand that the allegations\n\nin the complaint were false.\n\nNow my friend from the government\n\nsuggests that Bill Johnson isn\u0027t on point.  I\n\nwould submit precisely the opposite.  The whole\n\nissue in Bill Johnson\u0027s was whether the Board\n\ncould issue a cease-and-desist order against\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"81","file_name":"Glacier Northwest, Inc. v.
