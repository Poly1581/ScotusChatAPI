JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear\n\nargument next in Delaware versus Pennsylvania\n\nand Wisconsin and the consolidated case.\n\nMr. Katyal.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\n\nON BEHALF OF DELAWARE\n\nMR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case concerns a piece of\n\nstatutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which\n\nis found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a.\n\nThat provision exempts from the common law a\n\nnarrow set of instruments:  a money order,\n\ntraveler\u0027s check, or other similar written\n\ninstrument other than a third-party bank check.\n\nThe question today is whether two\n\nproducts, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram\n\nteller\u0027s checks, fall within that exemption.\n\nFor many years, the defendant states answered\n\nthat question \"no.\"  However, after engaging\n\nsome creative consultants, they changed their\n\nmind.\n\nThey were right the first time for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nfour separate reasons.  First, when Congress\n\nadopted that language in 1974, the term \"money\n\norder\" referred to specific commercial products\n\nlabeled \"money order\" and typically sold to\n\nunbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither\n\nof those apply to the two disputed instruments\n\nhere. They\u0027re not labeled \"money order,\" and\n\nthey are sold to consumers with bank accounts\n\nwho are transferring larger sums of money.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Delaware v.

So Congress in \u002774 was worried\n\nabout address collection requirements.  They\n\nsaid we want to head that off because that\u0027s\n\ngoing to increase the price of traveler\u0027s checks\n\nand money orders.  That\u0027s why they didn\u0027t write\n\nthe statute that you were saying, which is to\n\nimpose address requirements.\n\nThe findings in 2501 say no, we want\n\nthe reverse, because, if you -- if states start\n\ndoing that, it\u0027s going to increase the cost of\n\nthose instruments.  And so that concern doesn\u0027t\n\napply to the two disputed instruments here\n\nbecause the address information is already being\n\ncollected.

get rid of the common law for a broader set\n\nof instruments.\n\nIf you look at our blue brief at page\n\n31, it quotes the 1966 Model Act, Uniform Act\n\nfor the disposition of unclaimed property, and\n\nthat text is \"any sum ... on which a banking or\n\nfinancial organization or business association\n\nis directly liable, including, by way of\n\nillustration but not of limitation, CDs, drafts,\n\nmoney orders, and traveler\u0027s checks.\"\n\nNow the first part of that statute\n\nthat I just read to you is exactly the language\n\nfrom 2503.  Indeed, Judge Leval below said it\n\nwould be the most extreme coincidence that you\u0027d\n\nuse all of the same language from 1966 and the\n\nFDA.\n\nBut what isn\u0027t in there?

That\u0027s a second category.\n\nAnd then a third category of other\n\nsimilar instruments are some of the things that\n\nhave been bandied about in this litigation and\n\nin the briefs. So there\u0027s something called an\n\nagent check money order.  There\u0027s something\n\ncalled a personal money order.  That\u0027s in our\n\nappendix at page 381.

And I think your question\u0027s\n\nreally important because Judge Leval said, well,\n\nI\u0027m going to look to the Hunt Commission to\n\ndetermine what a third-party bank check is, and\n\na third-party bank check, he says, according to\n\nthe Hunt Commission, is a personal check.\n\nBut, actually, the Hunt Commission\n\nsays that\u0027s just one example.  And, notably,\n\nreally importantly, at page 41 of our brief, we\n\nsay, if you go on and read what the Hunt\n\nCommission says, it actually says teller\u0027s\n\nchecks are third-party bank payment systems.\n\nSo the Hunt Commission invocation\n\nboomerangs on them.  It underscores that the\n\ntypes of disputed instruments here, these\n\nteller\u0027s checks, are third-party bank checks.\n\nCongress was worried about these larger-dollar\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nproducts, like teller\u0027s checks, and they\n\nspecifically exempted them.\n\nAnd so even if you didn\u0027t buy anything\n\nthat I\u0027ve been saying for the last 25 minutes","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"27","file_name":"Delaware v.

But marketing strategies\n\ndo not define commercial instruments and they\n\ndon\u0027t justify $250 million windfalls.\n\nRecognizing the weakness of that\n\nargument, Delaware alternatively claims that\n\nMoneyGram official checks are excluded from the\n\nFDA as third-party bank checks. That argument\n\nfares no better because MoneyGram is not a third\n\nparty as that term was used in 1974, and\n\nMoneyGram\u0027s official checks are absolutely not\n\nbank checks.\n\nNor, for that matter, does Delaware\n\nexplain why Congress would have chosen to\n\nexclude instruments that present precisely the\n\nwindfall problem that the FDA targeted.\n\nSo it\u0027s hardly surprising that all\n\nthree payment systems experts in this case,\n\nincluding Delaware\u0027s own expert, agreed that\n\nunder any ordinary understanding of the phrase\n\n\"third-party bank check,\" MoneyGram official\n\nchecks are not third-party bank checks.\n\nSo we would ask this Court to overrule\n\nthe exceptions and adopt the Special Master\u0027s\n\nrecommendation.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Bronni, would you\n\nspend a few minutes on the -- Mr. Katyal\u0027s","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"33","file_name":"Delaware v.

I think\n\nthis is one of the reasons why we\u0027re judging\n\nthings sort of on a class of instruments, and as\n\na class of instruments in contrast to official\n\nchecks and money orders, these are not always\n\nprepaid, so that it\u0027s a class-wide distinction.\n\nBut, even aside from that, there are\n\nother reasons why we believe that cashier\u0027s\n\nchecks, even aside from our definition, would\n\nnot be swept in under the term \"money order.\"\n\nAnd one of those reasons is I think,\n\nas, Justice Thomas, your question reflects, you\n\nknow, so there are instruments in the world that\n\npeople would not describe as money orders even\n\nif they share some of the common core features,\n\nand a cashier\u0027s check is a good example of that.\n\nWe would not in ordinary parlance call\n\na cashier\u0027s check a money order because it is a\n\nunique instrument in that it\u0027s issued by the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n41\n\nOfficial\n\nsame bank, drawn on that same bank, which makes\n\nit a uniquely secure instrument that is\n\ndifferent.\n\nSo, in -- in ordinary English, it\u0027s a\n\nwell-known instrument, as Delaware agrees, as","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"35","file_name":"Delaware v.
