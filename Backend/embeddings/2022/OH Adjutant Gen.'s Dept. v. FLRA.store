Authority.\n\nMr. Flowers.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN M. FLOWERS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. FLOWERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Sixth Circuit and the Federal\n\nLabor Relations Authority held that adjutants\n\ngeneral and state guards, when they employ\n\ntechnicians, are federal agencies to which the\n\nAuthority may issue orders.\n\nThat is wrong.  The Reform Act defines\n\nagencies to include executive departments,\n\ngovernment corporations, and independent\n\nestablishments.  Adjutants general and state\n\nguards are none of these things.  They\u0027re\n\nneither among nor part of the 15 Cabinet-level\n\nagencies that qualify as executive departments.\n\nThey\u0027re not government corporations because\n\nthey\u0027re not corporations.  And they\u0027re not\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nindependent establishments because they\u0027re not\n\npart of the executive branch.\n\nThe Authority concedes all of that,\n\nbut it claims it can regulate adjutants general\n\nand state guards anyway because they represent\n\nor act on behalf of the Defense Department,\n\nwhich is a Reform Act agency, when they employ\n\ntechnicians.\n\nBut the Reform Act says the Authority\n\ncan issue orders to agencies.

REAVES: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nPetitioners are required to comply\n\nwith the Act and submit to the FLRA\u0027s orders in\n\ncases like this one because of the role they\n\nplay in the federal employment system. It is\n\nuncontested that dual-status technicians have\n\ncollective bargaining rights because they are\n\nfederal civilian employees who are employed by\n\nparts of DOD, a covered agency.  And under\n\nSection 709(d) of Title 32, Petitioners employ\n\nand administer technicians pursuant to a\n\ndesignation of federal authority from DOD.\n\nOther provisions confirm that role.\n\nFor example, Section 2105 of Title V provides\n\nthat an adjutant general appoints technicians\n\ninto the federal civil service when he hires\n\nthem. Adjutants general thus only hire, fire,\n\nand supervise employees of DOD because they are\n\nacting as if they are part of and on behalf of\n\nthat agency.\n\nSimilarly, as Petitioners seem to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"48","file_name":"OH Adjutant Gen.\u0027s Dept. v.

So\n\nwhat Petitioners did in this case is they filed\n\nforms canceling dues withholding on behalf of\n\ndual-status technicians. They signed those\n\nforms. And that was something that was not\n\npermitted under the relevant statutes and\n\nregulatory provisions.\n\nSo I think it\u0027s fair that the Sixth\n\nCircuit said, to the extent that Ohio took that\n\naction, which may -- was outside the law, that\n\nthey can be required to correct that action.\n\nAnd I think, in any event, though,\n\nthat\u0027s really a side show in this case, because\n\nPetitioners haven\u0027t in any way suggested that\n\nthey\u0027re unable to comply with the remainder of\n\nthe FLRA\u0027s orders.\n\nAnd so, to the extent there\u0027s some\n\nminor thing that on the facts of this case you\n\nmight think problematic doesn\u0027t in any\n\nundermine -- any way undermine that generally\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"76","file_name":"OH Adjutant Gen.\u0027s Dept. v.

about the state actors who run\n\nour employment systems as agents of the federal\n\ngovernment?\n\nAre they now federal agencies for\n\npurposes of Title V? I can\u0027t see why the\n\nanswer would be no.\n\nSo, other than just an ad hoc -- a\n\ndecision that\u0027s good for this particular\n\ncontext and this particular case, there\u0027s just\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n106\n\nOfficial\n\nno way to read us into the Act.\n\nAnd that brings me to my second good\n\npoint.

First, they have control over many of\n\nthe issues with respect to which the\n\ntechnicians may wish to bargain and with\n\nrespect to which the Authority may wish to --\n\nto -- to make orders.\n\nI think there was a suggestion that we\n\nmight be crazy for saying that we would violate\n\nthe law by -- by reinstating dues. I might be\n\ncrazy but not for that reason.  We would have\n\nto break into the federal computer system and\n\nreinstate the dues ourselves because we do not\n\nactually withhold the dues.  The federal\n\ngovernment does.\n\nIn addition to the control they have,\n\nthere\u0027s no reason to think we\u0027re going to spar\n\nwith the Department of Defense.
