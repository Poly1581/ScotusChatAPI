be\n\njurisdictional, and then you discuss 2253,\n\n867(a), and 1447(d), and you say those are all\n\njurisdictional even though they don\u0027t use the\n\nword \"jurisdiction,\" correct?\n\nMR.

arguments conflict with\n\nthat judgment in two ways.\n\nFirst, Petitioner\n\nargues that her failure to exhaust is not a\n\njurisdictional defect.  But 1252(d)(1) imposes\n\na direct limit on a court\u0027s power, providing\n\nthat a court may review a final order of\n\nremoval only if the alien exhausted all\n\nadministrative remedies available as of right.\n\nThat language speaks clearly to a court\u0027s\n\nauthority, not simply to what a litigant must\n\ndo. Congress need not use the word\n\n\"jurisdiction,\" and there\u0027s no special rule for\n\nexhaustion requirements.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nCritically, this Court has never held\n\nthat a restriction like this one is not\n\njurisdictional.  Petitioner\u0027s contrary argument\n\nwould upset Congress\u0027s judgment that appellate\n\ncourts should review Board decisions, not\n\nadjudicate arguments in the first instance.\n\nSecond, Petitioner dilutes the\n\nstatutory exhaustion requirement.  She does not\n\nseriously dispute that issue exhaustion is\n\nrequired at least by regulation. Yet, she\n\ndraws on Social Security cases to say that the\n\nINA omits that critical obligation.  But\n\nnothing in the Social Security Act even\n\nreference administrative exhaustion, and its\n\nscheme is inherently non-adversarial.\n\nBy contrast, the INA expressly\n\nrequires administrative exhaustion in a highly\n\nadversarial system where non-citizens have long\n\nbeen required to identify errors for review.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"30","file_name":"Santos-Zacaria v.

Yes.\n\nBut the Court has\n\nreferred to that requirement in the Social\n\nSecurity Act as an exhaustion requirement.\n\nIt\u0027s not the exhaust -- the type of exhaustion\n\nrequirement we have here, but it\u0027s an\n\nexhaustion requirement that the Court has found\n\ncontinues to be jurisdictional post-Arbaugh.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: On the exhaustion\n\nprecedent that was being discussed earlier with\n\nyour colleague on the other side, my\n\nunderstanding of all the exhaustion cases we\n\nhave is that not a single one of them that I\u0027m\n\naware of or that was cited to us at least spoke\n\nto the Court\u0027s authority.\n\nIs that your understanding as well, as\n\ndistinct from putting a obligation on the\n\nlitigant in the statutory language?\n\nMS. DUBIN: Yeah, and I think the best\n\nexample of the comparator is the PLRA, which is\n\nwritten as \"no action shall be brought,\" which\n\nis a very different type of phrasing, as\n\nopposed to a limitation on a power.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- but it\u0027s not as\n\nthough those cases used that sort of\n\ndistinction.

We -- we\n\nhave gotten into Congress\u0027s mind and said, you\n\nknow, when they impose an exhaustion\n\nrequirement, we think that almost always they\n\nmean that that\u0027s not jurisdictional in the true\n\nsense of the word?\n\nMS.

I think that when Congress imposes a\n\nrestriction on the relationship between an\n\nadjudicative agency proceeding and a court of\n\nappeals, it actually would want that to be\n\njurisdictional.  And if we\u0027re looking to what\n\nCongress would want, I think this is exactly\n\nthe type of provision that Congress would want\n\nto be jurisdictional because it means that a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n72\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"64","file_name":"Santos-Zacaria v.
