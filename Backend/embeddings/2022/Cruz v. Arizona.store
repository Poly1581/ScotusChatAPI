earlier in Simmons.  Cruz\u0027s jury labored\n\nunder a seriously wrong idea.  Indeed, the jury\n\nforeman the very next day said:  \"We wanted a\n\nreason to be lenient, and many of us would have\n\nrather voted for life, but we were not given an\n\noption to vote for life in prison without the\n\npossibility of parole.\"\n\nCruz wasn\u0027t the only one.

In 2016, this Court summarily reversed\n\nall this in Lynch, fundamentally changing\n\ncapital trials in Arizona.  Cruz then used Lynch\n\nto seek post-conviction relief under Arizona\n\nRule 32.1(g). Yet, the Arizona Supreme Court\n\nrefused, saying Lynch didn\u0027t change the law; it\n\njust changed the application of the law.\n\nThat interpretation of Rule 32 is not\n\nan adequate and independent state ground for\n\nthree separate reasons.  First, to be adequate,\n\nan interpretation must be firmly established and\n\nregularly followed.  This hair-splitting\n\ndistinction between changes in the law and\n\napplications of the law is entirely novel,\n\nentirely hand-crafted.
