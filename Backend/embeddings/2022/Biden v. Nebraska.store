it has\n\ncaused enormous disruption and economic\n\ndistress.  Over the past three years, millions\n\nof Americans have struggled to pay rent,\n\nutilities, food, and many have been unable to\n\npay their debts.\n\nTo head off immediate harm for\n\nstudent-loan borrowers, two Secretaries across\n\ntwo administrations invoked the HEROES Act to\n\nsuspend interest and payment obligations for all\n\nAmericans with federally held loans.

We could, of course, sue\n\nto protect interests -- distinct rights and\n\ninterests of the United States.  And so\n\nRespondents have cited some cases, for example,\n\nwhere a -- an instrumentality entered into a\n\ncontract on behalf of the United States in the\n\nname of the United States as its agent, and we\n\nhad a contract right that we could enforce in\n\nour own name, or there was another case that\n\ninvolved a statutory right in the tax context to\n\noffset, and the United States was permitted to\n\nsue on that basis because it had its own rights\n\nand interests.\n\nBut we\u0027ve never done what the states\n\nare doing here and, in the absence of any\n\nunderlying contract right or statutory right or\n\ntrust right, just asserted this all-purpose\n\nability to blur the distinction between the\n\nsovereign and instrumentalities when they\u0027re\n\nseparately incorporated in this way.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --\n\nthank you, General.

PRELOGAR:  Well, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, let me try to respond to the concerns\n\nabout both the role for the judiciary and the\n\nrole for Congress here.\n\nWe are not suggesting that there\u0027s no\n\nrole for the judiciary to play. It\u0027s that these\n\nplaintiffs are not proper plaintiffs in this\n\ncase. Of course, the Court is bound by Article\n\nIII, and as I acknowledged to Justice Alito, we\n\nthink that loan servicers, for example, would\n\nhave standing to challenge this plan.\n\nBut the fact that the -- the loan\n\nservicers haven\u0027t yet challenged to date doesn\u0027t\n\nprovide a basis to overlook those fundamental\n\nArticle III requirements and distort the meaning\n\nof how this Court has previously articulated\n\nstanding principles in a circumstance where the\n\nstates can\u0027t otherwise demonstrate their\n\nstanding to sue.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nWith respect to the role for Congress,\n\nI think what\u0027s clear is, of course, we\u0027re\n\nrecognizing that Congress could take additional\n\naction if it disapproves this plan.  In fact,\n\nthere were bills introduced to alter the text of\n\nthe HEROES Act to specifically provide that the\n\nSecretary can\u0027t authorize loan discharge.  Those\n\nbills didn\u0027t pass, but that\u0027s one role Congress\n\ncan play.\n\nI think, though, that if the Court is\n\nfocused on trying to ensure that Congress\u0027s role","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"28","file_name":"Biden v.

that.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Sure.  And -- and\n\nso, first, I want to take on the argument that\n\nsome amici have made in this case about\n\nimplicating appropriations authority.\n\nOf course, implementing this program\n\ndoesn\u0027t require that any money be drawn from the\n\nTreasury, and so I don\u0027t think that it strictly\n\nraises an appropriations issue, which is why I\n\nthink the states aren\u0027t raising that argument\n\nhere.\n\nAnd to the extent that the concern is\n\nabout the Secretary taking action in a way that\n\nCongress didn\u0027t authorize, it seems to me that\n\nit just collapses back into the central\n\ninterpretive question in this case, which is:\n\nDoes the HEROES Act authorize the Secretary\u0027s\n\naction or not?\n\nWith respect to the concern you raised\n\nthat the -- the effect of loan forgiveness here\n\nwill result in cancellation of a measure of debt\n\nfor the affected borrowers, of course, that\u0027s\n\ntrue, but I don\u0027t think that that is materially\n\ndifferent from the kind of effects you can see\n\nfrom other types of authority that\u0027s long been\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"32","file_name":"Biden v.

The\n\nsecond interest is in the Lewis and Clark\n\nDiscovery Fund.
