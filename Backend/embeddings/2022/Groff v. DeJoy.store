The other thing is\n\nyou say that the government is not making the\n\nde minimis argument.  So what is the daylight\n\nbetween your argument now and the government\u0027s\n\nargument?\n\nMR. STREETT: Sure.  It is best\n\nexplained by what the government thinks arises\n\nto the level of an undue hardship. They use a\n\nvariety of different formulations.  But, when\n\nthe rubber meets the road, that\u0027s where we see\n\nthe daylight.  And we see that the government\n\nbelieves that any loss of efficiency is going to\n\nbe an undue hardship.  Any regular payment of\n\npremium wages, for example, paying overtime to\n\none person per week to attract that person to\n\ncover a Sabbatarian\u0027s shift, the denial of a\n\nsingle coworker\u0027s secular preference, according\n\nto the government, is an undue hardship.\n\nSo, when we take all of that together,\n\nwhile the government\u0027s test might sound better\n\nthan Hardison\u0027s on its face, it would have the\n\neffect of eviscerating certainly any Sabbatarian\n\nobservance, which was at the very core of what\n\nthe Court -- what the -- Congress was trying to\n\nprotect.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n--\n\n7\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"4","file_name":"Groff v.

I think, if you read pages 83\n\nand 84 in Hardison, the three sentences that\n\nfollow this Court\u0027s enunciation of the\n\nde minimis test are all about that Title VII\n\nrequires neutrality and it\u0027s not appropriate to\n\ngive a preference for religious reasons for not\n\nworking on the weekend.\n\nAbercrombie completely reversed that\n\nunderstanding of Title VII.  But, even if you\u0027re\n\nnot persuaded by that, Your Honor, certainly,\n\nthe reliance interests are very weak here.\n\nThey\u0027re even weaker than they were in Janice\n\nbecause employers are always required to update\n\ntheir HR manuals to adjust to this Court\u0027s\n\ndecisions.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Do you -- Mr. Streett,\n\ndo you think that a change in this Court\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"16","file_name":"Groff v.

ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nFor almost 50 years, courts have\n\napplied Hardison when analyzing undue hardship\n\nunder Title VII.  A substantial body of case law\n\nhas developed to guide that context-dependent\n\nanalysis, and that case law provides meaningful\n\nprotection to religious observants.\n\nPetitioner asks this Court to throw\n\nall that away and overrule Hardison.

His\n\nargument boils down to a claim that Hardison was\n\nwrong because it insufficiently protects\n\nreligious employees.\n\nBut that is a policy argument that he\n\nshould direct to Congress.  And it ultimately\n\nreduces to the claim that it was wrongly\n\ndecided, which this Court has said over and over\n\nagain is not enough in the statutory\n\nstare decisis context.\n\nPetitioner is also wrong about\n\nHardison\u0027s effects.

open\n\nquestion in the case about which version of the\n\nstatute applied, whether 1972 or the predecessor\n\nversion, and both Hardison and the U.S.\n\nGovernment in the case said there was an

The narrow category of\n\ncases where that\u0027s not happening is when there\u0027s\n\na -- a legitimate safety concern, like you work\n\nin a steel mill and you can\u0027t modify the dress\n\ncode because wearing a skirt will interfere with\n\noperating the machinery, for example.\n\nThe third category involves religious\n\nexpression in the workplace.  This can include\n\ndisplaying a religious symbol or potentially\n\nneeding an exemption from employer-sponsored\n\nreligious speech in a meeting.\n\nThere too, courts are regularly\n\ngranting accommodations, and it\u0027s only in the\n\ncircumstances, for example, where the religious\n\nspeech would amount to harassment of coworkers\n\nor customers that the undue hardship defense is\n\ncredited.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  And, General, you\n\nthink all three of those categories under a\n\nproper understanding of the law, whatever\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"71","file_name":"Groff v.

My friend suggested it was just\n\na de minimis burden there transferring as\n\nbetween 40 and 39 employees. But the record\n\ndemonstrates that given the nature of the work\n\nand the number of RCAs who had to be on duty,\n\nthey were working at least every other weekend,\n\nand the testimony showed it was often two out of\n\nthree weekends.\n\nAnd so, once you start taking away\n\ntheir weekend off, that led to the unrest and\n\nthe disruption of the workflow that we saw here.\n\nAnd when Petitioner was absent, they had to stay\n\non their routes longer and later, going out\n\nafter dark for routes that were unfamiliar to\n\nget those packages delivered.\n\nThat counts as real-world impact and\n\nundue hardship under any reasonable standard.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kagan?\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  General, the EEOC\n\nguidance is -- is -- it gives relatively clear\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"91","file_name":"Groff v.

KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBarrett?\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  So you\u0027ve said a\n\nnumber of times and it seems clear that this is\n\na contextual inquiry.  But it seems to me that\n\nthere\u0027s one bright line that you are asking for\n\nthat you\u0027re pulling out of Hardison, and that\u0027s\n\nmoney.\n\nAnd -- and I understand your answers\n\nto some of the questions, especially to Justice\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n112\n\nOfficial\n\nAlito, to be anything more than you would\n\notherwise pay, even if it\u0027s $1 an hour, to the\n\nAmazon person, under Hardison, it\u0027s your\n\nunderstanding that that\u0027s a premium wage because","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"100","file_name":"Groff v.

I don\u0027t think I would draw\n\nthe line quite that bright, but I do understand\n\nHardison to have suggested that that is an\n\ninappropriate and unwarranted type of\n\naccommodation.  And I think it\u0027s not just\n\nbecause of the cost.  In fact, you can imagine\n\nscenarios like the one Justice Alito posited\n\nwhere maybe the costs don\u0027t seem that\n\nsignificant.\n\nInstead, I think it really goes to\n\nwhat I was trying to say earlier, that it\u0027s\n\nabout the nature of the accommodation.  You\u0027re\n\njust excusing someone from doing part of their\n\njob, and you\u0027re transferring to the employer the\n\nongoing requirement to have to fill that spot\n\nand pay more to do so in getting a replacement\n\nworker in there.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I guess I\n\ndon\u0027t see why it\u0027s ongoing.
