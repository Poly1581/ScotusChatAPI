ORTIZ\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. ORTIZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThe Eighth Circuit ruled in this case\n\nthat someone in prison for something the court\n\nlater determines has never been a crime has no\n\nmeans to challenge his continued detention once\n\nhis opportunity to file a 2255 motion runs out.\n\nHe must remain in prison despite having done\n\nnothing wrong. But, as this Court held in\n\nDavis, conviction and punishment for an act that\n\nthe law does not make criminal inherently\n\nresults in a complete miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit\u0027s ruling is wrong\n\nfor four separate reasons.  First, it violates\n\nthe text of 2255(e). Its key terms all indicate\n\nthat traditional habeas relief should be\n\navailable, that a prisoner should have one\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nopportunity to have the correct law applied to\n\nhis case.  The Eighth Circuit held, however,\n\nthat so long as 2255 provides a purely formal\n\nopportunity to raise an issue, it doesn\u0027t matter\n\nwhether the law applied is correct or wrong.\n\nPrisoners in this situation, moreover, do not\n\neven have that purely formal opportunity.  They\n\nwill almost always be barred from raising the\n\nissue in their initial 2255 motion.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Jones v.

FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nAs you point out, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nthis case presents something of a conundrum, and\n\nit\u0027s no secret that it\u0027s one that we\u0027ve\n\nstruggled with.  And what makes this case\n\ndifficult is the -- the key phrase, \"inadequate\n\nor ineffective to test the legality\" of his\n\ndetention, obviously requires some comparator\n\nbenchmark, and it can be a little bit difficult\n\nto identify what the proper benchmark is.\n\nAnd for a long time, we and the lower\n\ncourts were operating under the assumption that\n\nthe choices were between kind of indeterminate\n\nnotions of fairness, which is I still think what\n\nPetitioner is offering, and kind of an unhelpful\n\nself comparison where what you see is what you\n\nget with 2255, which is I think what the court\n\nof appeals did and what amicus is defending.\n\nBut I think this Court\u0027s cases, when\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"23","file_name":"Jones v.

this, in Haymond and\n\nSanders, read the text in a third and much\n\nbetter way that makes federal habeas corpus the\n\ncomparator.  The saving clause quite literally\n\nsaves those lingering applications of habeas\n\ncorpus that Congress has never withdrawn and\n\nthat Section 25\u0027s motions remedy doesn\u0027t itself\n\ncover. And one of those is statutory claims of\n\nactual innocence by a prisoner who can rely on\n\nan intervening decision of this Court.\n\nNow I think the critical interpretive\n\nquestion in this case is the negative\n\nimplication of Section 2255(h), which doesn\u0027t\n\nactually mention habeas.  To what degree did\n\nSection 2255(h) not only restrict the motion\n\nremedy to which it expressly refers but also\n\nprovide the kind of clear statement that\u0027s\n\nnecessary to withdraw the habeas remedy as well?\n\nAnd I think a couple of things that\n\nmight be useful to explain why we think it\n\ndoesn\u0027t withdraw the habeas remedy for the\n\nstatutory claims would be to discuss a little\n\nbit how you figure out what the current scope of\n\nfederal habeas is and what -- the kinds of\n\nstatutory claims we\u0027re talking about here.

FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor,\n\nhonestly, I-- I can\u0027t tell you that it\u0027s\n\nimpossible that there\u0027s some implication we\n\nhaven\u0027t foreseen, but we really think this is,\n\nas far as merits claims go, essentially a\n\ncategory -- probably a category of one.\n\nSo you look to see whether it is the\n\ntype of claim that we\u0027re dealing with here, a\n\npurely statutory claim that asserts that\n\nsomebody is in prison for something that\n\nCongress never made a crime.  If so, can that\n\nperson make a -- make the threshold necessary\n\nshowing of actual factual innocence under\n\nBousley, which can take into account not just\n\nthe evidence that was presented at trial but all\n\nthe evidence that could have been presented.\n\nAnd we state in our brief, and I\u0027m happy to\n\nrestate here, all the reasons why Petitioner\n\ncan\u0027t even get a toe in the door.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Could I just clarify\n\nwhat you mean by \"actual factual innocence?\"\n\nSo, when you have such a person and they\u0027re in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"38","file_name":"Jones v.

RATNER: So, Justice Jackson, and\n\nwith all due respect to that suggestion in your\n\nopinion, Justice Barrett, I think that every\n\nindication is to the contrary.\n\nIf we look to the text, there are\n\nspecific areas in 2255 where Congress talked\n\nabout rules more generally, like in the statute\n\nof limitations.  And then, in 2255(h), it\n\nnarrows that to rules of constitutional law.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"49","file_name":"Jones v.

I know that the Government says, you\n\nknow, look, it\u0027s too easy to cry clemency in\n\nevery case, but this is a very unusual set of\n\ncases that the Government handled exclusively by\n\nexecutive clemency until 1974, and after AEDPA\n\nin 1996, the first thing the Government told\n\ncourts was, if courts step back, we\u0027re ready to\n\nstep up again.\n\nThis has been our prerogative for most\n\nof the nation\u0027s history.  And I do think that\n\nshould give the Court some comfort here, even if\n\nit wouldn\u0027t make the same judgment calls that\n\nCongress made in 2255.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"63","file_name":"Jones v.

And why not?\n\nMS. RATNER: So, Justice Jackson, with\n\nrespect to your first point, I think there is\n\ncommon ground that in 1948 Congress wanted these\n\nto be effectively the same.  I guess we differ\n\nin that I don\u0027t believe that Congress in 1948\n\nhandcuffed a future Congress from preventing any\n\nlimits on 2255 without going back and revising\n\nan essentially defunct habeas remedy at that\n\npoint, although I should flag, if the Court is\n\nconsidering going down that path, it is going to\n\ngrapple -- have to grapple with the provision\n\n2244(a) that the Government mentioned, and, in\n\nfact, it did in AEDPA revise the availability of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n78\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"71","file_name":"Jones v.
