KELLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nAs far back as 1827, states enacted\n\nlaws like Pennsylvania\u0027s, and by 1868 or shortly\n\nthereafter, every state in the union had at\n\nleast one and often several\n\nconsent-by-registration statutes.  This Court\n\nunanimously confirmed that such statutes comport\n\nwith due process over a century ago in reasoning\n\nthat\u0027s been embraced by jurists from Holmes to\n\nCardozo to Hand to Frankfurter.\n\nWith history, tradition, and precedent\n\non Mr. Mallory\u0027s side, how can my friend\n\nchallenge Pennsylvania law under the original\n\nmeaning of due process?  By claiming that these\n\nstatutes were really just about specific\n\njurisdiction based on contacts.  Never mind that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nspecific jurisdiction wasn\u0027t a thing in 1868 and\n\nfor decades after the Fourteenth Amendment was\n\nratified.  Anachronistically, importing the\n\nprinciples of International Shoe into the\n\nratification generation is my friend\u0027s maneuver,\n\nexactly what Justice Scalia counseled against in\n\nBurnham.\n\nThat approach is not originalism.\n\nIt\u0027s paying lip service to originalism, treating\n\nthe doctrine as an infinitely malleable pretext\n\nto reach a policy outcome that Norfolk Southern\n\nand other big businesses prefer.\n\nBut originalism is not a pretext.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"2","file_name":"Mallory v.

which\n\nis not surprising given the historical modes of\n\ntransportation.  But the text of these statutes\n\nis crystal clear.  It applies to the foreign\n\ncubed situation.

So, for example, many states had multiple\n\nconsent-by-registration statutes on their books\n\nsimultaneously.  Tennessee, Michigan, and\n\nIndiana said that, for insurance companies,\n\nyou\u0027ve got to consent to general jurisdiction.\n\nBut, for other companies, other foreign\n\ncompanies, you don\u0027t have to do that.  You only\n\nhave to consent to what we would now call\n\nspecific jurisdiction.\n\nWere the legislatures confused?  They\n\ndidn\u0027t know that they were using different\n\nlanguage?

I would respectfully ask my\n\nfriend, identify the case that overturned\n\nPennsylvania Fire.\n\nDon\u0027t just point to some\n\ngeneral line of cases.  What overturned it?\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well,\n\nInternational Shoe, I mean, the fact that they\n\ndidn\u0027t have a footnote saying, oh, all these\n\nother cases inconsistent with our approach have\n\nbeen overruled doesn\u0027t mean that they\u0027re any\n\nless -- no longer good law.\n\nMR. KELLER: International Shoe, Your\n\nHonor, is completely compatible with this\n\nregime.  International Shoe expressly says it\u0027s\n\ntalking about how to get jurisdiction over a\n\nnon-consenting corporation.  It leaves\n\ncompletely untouched the ground of consent.\n\nAnd so, yes, we were living in a\n\nPennoyer world. In 1945, this Court introduced\n\nminimum contacts as a way to ground\n\njurisdiction, but it didn\u0027t supplant consent and\n\nother traditional means of establishing\n\njurisdiction.  That\u0027s what Justice Scalia\u0027s\n\nplurality opinion for this Court says in\n\nBurnham.  International Shoe can live alongside\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11\n\nOfficial\n\nthose traditional means.\n\nSo I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything in\n\nInternational Shoe that\u0027s inconsistent with\n\nconsent-by-registration, which, again, is why no\n\ncourt in the United States found one of these\n\nstatutes unconstitutional until 1971.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"8","file_name":"Mallory v.

have several reasons at the end of\n\nour brief where we explain why the main statute\n\nthat\u0027s been mentioned we think wouldn\u0027t need to\n\nbe decided by the Court here.  It\u0027s -- it\u0027s a\n\ncase that in -- we -- we think there that\n\nthere\u0027s potential differences between the Fifth\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment, as the Court has\n\nrepeatedly mentioned and reserved the question\n\nmost recently in Bristol-Myers.\n\nBut even apart from that, we think\n\nthat the Congress and the executive branch in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n121\n\nOfficial\n\nthe context at issue there have a greater\n\nability to assess international and interstate\n\nconsiderations.  So the interstate federalism\n\naspect drops out. So we think that the rule\n\nwould be different if Congress were to come in\n\nhere and try to -- to make different\n\narrangements. The removal statute that was at\n\nissue, that was a right that was at -- Congress\n\npassed.\n\nThe interstate federalism issues drop\n\nout in a way when Congress is the arbiter,\n\ninstead of having individual states inject\n\nthemselves into lawsuits that are -- that they\n\notherwise don\u0027t have interests in.\n\nSo those are some of the reasons why,\n\neven though I haven\u0027t been asked about that\n\nparticular statute, we wanted to make sure that\n\nyou heard our arguments in this case.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nGorsuch?\n\nJustice Kavanaugh?\n\nJustice Barrett?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"108","file_name":"Mallory v.

I won\u0027t use all five minutes.\n\nI think I heard my friend say that\n\nthere\u0027s no statute prior to the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment that allows this.  There are so many\n\nexamples I don\u0027t have time to list them all, so\n\nI\u0027ll give you two of my favorites.\n\nThe very first statute that we found,\n\nVirginia in 1827, this is the Petition Appendix\n\nat 251a.  What I love about this statute is the\n\nlegislature of Virginia enacted a law for a\n\nspecific railroad company from Maryland.  It\n\ndidn\u0027t just make the railroad company consent to\n\npersonal jurisdiction; it made the railroad\n\ncompany incorporate in Virginia. So talk about\n\nbecoming subject to general jurisdiction.  Under\n\nmodern doctrine, it would be undisputed that the\n\nrailroad would be fined there.\n\nThen you can look at Vermont in 1862.\n\nThis is in the appendix at 246a. I cite this\n\nexample because a lot of statutes had similar\n\nlanguage that said that you have to consent to\n\nbe served with process as if the process had\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"109","file_name":"Mallory v.
