It concedes that the\n\nright-to-control doctrine \"could lead to\n\noverbroad results that would expand property\n\nfraud beyond the definition at common law and as\n\nCongress would have understood it.\"\n\nInstead, the government offers a new\n\nand even broader theory of fraud, fraudulent\n\ninducement of a transaction.  Yet, in the 150\n\nyears since the mail fraud statute was enacted,\n\nno case of this Court has embraced that theory.\n\nThis Court should not do so now.\n\nFirst, the Court should not entertain\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nthe theory at all.

It proceeded solely on the right\n\nto control.  And it used that theory to exclude\n\ncritical defense evidence.\n\nThird, the new theory is wrong.  The\n\ntheory dispenses with a quintessential\n\nrequirement of common law fraud, harm to a\n\ntraditional property interest if the scheme\n\nsucceeds.  It would radically expand federal\n\nlaw, violate federalism principles, and end-run\n\nlimits on honest-services fraud.

DREEBEN: Well, Justice Barrett,\n\nthe reason why I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s an\n\nappropriate issue for the Second Circuit to get\n\non remand is this Court\u0027s repeated statements in\n\ncases like Dunn, McCormick, and specifically\n\nChiarella and McNally itself that the Court\n\ncannot affirm a criminal conviction on the basis\n\nof a theory not presented to the jury.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  But that -- but\n\nthere\u0027s a -- there\u0027s a gulf between not\n\naffirming and acquitting.  I mean, we could not\n\naffirm and send it back, and then maybe the\n\nSecond Circuit says there has to be a new trial\n\non whatever other theory the government has.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"8","file_name":"Ciminelli v.

FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, the\n\njury was instructed on the language of right to\n\ncontrol assets, and both the jury\u0027s instructions\n\nand deliberations, as well as the Second\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial\n\nCircuit\u0027s consideration of the case, occurred\n\nagainst a backdrop factual context where\n\neveryone understood the undisputed fact that\n\nwhat was really at issue here were lucrative\n\ngovernment contracts.\n\nAnd that\u0027s why the Second Circuit goes\n\non to reject the idea that there\u0027s any dichotomy\n\nbetween the bid-rigging process and the award of\n\nthe actual contracts. If the theory were as\n\nbroad as the sentence that Your Honor read\n\nsuggested, there\u0027d really be no need to do that\n\nbecause you deprived it of economic information\n\nsimply by rigging the bid-rigging process.\n\nInstead, the court makes clear -- and\n\nthis is at Footnote 9 on page 22a of the\n\nPetition Appendix -- that one of the reasons why\n\nthis is fraud is because it was an essential\n\nelement of the bargain, which I think maps\n\ndirectly onto what materiality would require in\n\nthis context, and that\u0027s because it was\n\nincorporated into the notice to proceed that the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"42","file_name":"Ciminelli v.

This isn\u0027t an\n\nabstract question of whether the evidence looked\n\nat from hindsight years later in this Court\n\ncould conceivably have supported a valid theory\n\nof property fraud.  We were denied again and\n\nagain the right to admit evidence because the\n\ngovernment relied on the right-to-control\n\ntheory.\n\nWe detailed this at the petition reply\n\nbrief at page 11, the Kaloyeros reply brief at\n\npage 9, and you can look at the Petition\n\nAppendix at 33A, where the Second Circuit says\n\nthe defendants wanted to introduce evidence that\n\nthis transaction was entirely fair as a way of\n\nrefuting that it was designed to inflict a\n\nproperty harm.  The Court says can\u0027t do that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n76\n\nOfficial\n\nbecause of right to control.\n\nSo I think that when you add all of\n\nthose things together, this is not a case in\n\nwhich the government can revive an abstract\n\ntheory that it has come to this Court for the\n\nfirst time and says, if you look at the Second\n\nCircuit\u0027s doctrine differently, it really would\n\nsatisfy the elements of a proper property fraud\n\ntheory.\n\nThey waived that.  They waived it, as\n\nJustice Gorsuch pointed out, when they\n\nsuperseded the indictment to get rid of it, and\n\nthey litigated this case throughout\n\nstrategically to make their burden lighter to\n\nconvict on right to control.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"68","file_name":"Ciminelli v.
