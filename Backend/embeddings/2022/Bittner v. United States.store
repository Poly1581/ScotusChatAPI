There\u0027s nothing inherently wrong\n\nwith not filing a document listing your\n\naccounts.  This is only to prevent other\n\ncriminal conduct or other substantive\n\nmisconduct.  And it\u0027s pretty unusual to see a\n\ndraconian punishment of millions of dollars of\n\nfines for not filing, accidentally in our case,\n\nand even in a willful violation doing it on\n\npurpose, you know, a single document.\n\nNow I will point out that for a\n\nwillful violation, given the way that the\n\npenalty is structured, it\u0027s still a single\n\nviolation, but the penalty can go up based on\n\nthe balances in the accounts that you didn\u0027t\n\nreport.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"18","file_name":"Bittner v.

of the statutory scheme flows\n\nstraightforwardly from the text.\n\nAs Justice Kagan illustrated this\n\nmorning, Section 5321(a)(5) sets up a one-to-one\n\ncorrespondence in which each undisclosed account\n\nis a separate violation.  We know that because\n\nthe rules in Section 5321(a)(5) for determining\n\nthe maximum penalty for a given violation\n\ninvolving an undisclosed account turn on the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial\n\nbalance in that particular account.\n\nPetitioner\u0027s reliance on the\n\nDictionary Act is therefore misplaced.  The\n\nbackground rules in that Act don\u0027t apply if the\n\ncontext of a particular statute indicates\n\notherwise.  Here, the text of Section -- of\n\nSection 5321(a)(5) demonstrates that Congress\n\nused the singular precisely and with care to\n\nestablish a one-to-one relationship, the\n\nrelationship I just described:  one account, one\n\nviolation, one potential civil penalty.\n\nReading the statute\u0027s references to a\n\nsingle account to mean one or more accounts\n\nwould defeat Congress\u0027s deliberate design.  And\n\nthere is a good reason that Congress set the\n\npenalty scheme up this way.  Each time a U.S.\n\nperson maintains an account with a foreign bank,\n\nthat relationship is a matter of distinct\n\nconcern to the United States.

I think it would have\n\nbeen more helpful if the agency had gone on to\n\nsay that, actually, if you fail to report more\n\nthan one account, the penalty per unreported\n\naccount is $10,000.  That has been the agency\u0027s\n\ninstitutional position for many years.  This is\n\nnot a case in which there is any legitimate\n\nsuggestion the agency has shifted positions over\n\ntime. This is at best a kind of attack on the\n\nagency\u0027s messaging to the public, which maybe\n\ncould have been better, but I don\u0027t think that\n\nthat should decide the question here.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"61","file_name":"Bittner v.

you need to find an\n\naccountant in -- in wherever you\u0027re living\n\nthat\u0027s knowledgeable in U.S. Bank Secrecy Act\n\nlaw that knows you need to -- need to file an\n\nFBAR.\n\nTo even know to ask that question is\n\npretty extraordinary when accountants in the\n\nU.S., as the Center For Taxpayer Rights pointed\n\nout, were -- in the United States accounts were\n\nunaware of these requirements dating back about\n\na decade ago.\n\nSo, again, the question really in this\n\ncase is what was Congress thinking when they\n\nimposed a specific requirement to file reports\n\nor keep records.  And they did not say do this\n\nby account.  As Justice Gorsuch pointed out,\n\nthere is no language in (a)(5) defining the\n\nviolation that is phrased in account-specific\n\nlanguage even though Congress took care to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n85\n\nOfficial\n\nspecify what a separate violation is in other\n\nsections of 5321.\n\nI think, when they didn\u0027t do that with\n\n(a)(5) and when you look at the extraordinary\n\nconsequences of adopting the government\u0027s\n\napproach, where you\u0027re effectively giving the\n\nIRS discretion to decide between a range of zero\n\nand many multiples of the statutory ceiling, I\n\nthink it becomes pretty clear what Congress had\n\nin mind.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.
