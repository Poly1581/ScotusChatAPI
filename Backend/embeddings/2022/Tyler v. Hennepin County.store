MARTIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nWhen the government takes property to\n\nsatisfy a debt and takes more than what is owed,\n\nit has a constitutional duty to return or pay\n\nfor the excess.  Here, Geraldine Tyler owed\n\n$15,000, which included nearly $13,000 in\n\npenalties, interest, and related costs.  To\n\nsatisfy that debt, Hennepin County took\n\nMs. Tyler\u0027s former home, which was worth much\n\nmore than that, and later sold it for $40,000.\n\nThe county kept all $40,000 for public uses.\n\nBy taking absolute title to\n\nMs. Tyler\u0027s property, including the value that\n\nexceeded the debt, the county has taken private\n\nproperty without just compensation.

Instead,\n\nthe county took everything.\n\nThe county apparently does not dispute\n\nthat Ms. Tyler had a property interest in her\n\nformer home or in its value.

And I\n\nthink that the history of tax collection or debt\n\ncollection from the government is pretty uniform\n\non the question of personal property.  In fact,\n\nMinnesota -- in Minnesota, Hennepin County, for\n\nexample, if they\u0027re collecting personal property\n\ntaxes, they\u0027re not allowed to take more than\n\nwhat\u0027s owed.

we do think valuation here does have to\n\nhappen with respect to when absolute title was\n\ntaken in 2015, whether there\u0027s a sale or not.\n\nI think, when there is a tax sale,\n\nthat can be very relevant evidence of the amount\n\nof compensation that\u0027s due because, even though\n\nthat tax sale happens later and is a forced\n\nsale, this Court has been clear that just\n\ncompensation has to be just to both the public\n\nand the property owner.  And it would not be\n\njust to the public to ask that the state\n\neffectively provide some value that was not\n\nrealized in the tax sale.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  But how would that\n\nwork here?  You\u0027re talking about a condominium,\n\nand the -- from what I can tell, the only way\n\nyou knew of this differential between the taxes\n\nowed and the value was because it was sold.\n\nHow would you determine the value of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial\n\nit if you never sold it -- if this -- if the\n\ncounty never sold it?\n\nMS.

If the government\n\ncondemns a property, it\u0027s not necessarily going\n\nto sell it, and so courts do have valuation\n\nmechanisms.

don\u0027t know specifically if they\n\nlook to other sales of similar property.\n\nI\n\nwould assume that\u0027s how they do it.\n\nBut I don\u0027t think this is a -- a\n\nproblem that\u0027s unique in this context.  And if I\n\ncould just take a step back and explain why we\n\nthink the difference between the interests here,\n\nas we define it and as my friend defines it, is\n\nimportant.\n\nYou know, Petitioner speaks about this\n\nas equity in property.  I think, if there\u0027s a\n\nfreestanding equity right, that could be\n\nproblematic in some of the Court\u0027s other lines\n\nof cases.\n\nSo, most notably, in the regulatory\n\ntakings context, this Court has long understood\n\nthat the government may enact regulations that\n\ncan affect the value of property, sort of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\nadjusting the burdens of economic life, as this\n\nCourt has said it, and that that is not always\n\nor even, you know, often going to be a taking.\n\nAnd so I think it\u0027s much more\n\nstraightforward to think about this as she had\n\nabsolute fee simple title.

ROSS: That\u0027s correct, Justice\n\nJackson. And this, I think, goes to some of the\n\nearlier questions as well.  You know, if the\n\nstate had a system where it recognized that it\u0027s\n\nnot entitled to the full value and so it\n\ntherefore had a mechanism to cash out that value\n\non the back end, there would be no taking.  And\n\nso we wouldn\u0027t be thinking about this in terms\n\nof just compensation. It would just be a\n\nstatutory question of, you know, have you gotten\n\nthe amount that the statute said you would get,\n\nwhich presumably would be the tax surplus.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  And so the taking\n\ntakes place whether the government then goes on\n\nto say it -- sell it or not in your view?\n\nMS. ROSS: Exactly.  And I think that\n\nthat\u0027s, you know, one problem with the way the\n\ncourt of appeals looked at this in this case,\n\nwas it said, you know, you didn\u0027t have any right\n\nto the surplus at the later time because we\u0027ve\n\n-- the state had defined away the surplus. But\n\nthat also suggests, you know, that just by\n\nkeeping it there would be no taking.

I think what\u0027s really going\n\non here is partially that the state wants to,\n\nyou know, pay -- not -- not be left really\n\nholding the bag on these properties and also\n\nthat it\u0027s just easier from an administrative\n\nconvenience standpoint.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, well, what\n\nabout the fact, as you point out, that in every\n\nother circumstance, whether it\u0027s for assessing\n\nmarital property, child support, or private\n\nmortgage lender foreclosing, everybody else has\n\nto abide by the usual rule that you only take\n\nwhat you\u0027re owed?  It\u0027s just in this particular\n\ncircumstance the state favors itself.

Nelson\n\nunderscores.\n\nAnd, third, Petitioner\u0027s theory would\n\ndeclare many state statutes today\n\nunconstitutional and create practical problems\n\nakin to what Justice Sotomayor referred to,\n\nincluding forcing governments to act as real\n\nestate agents and fiduciaries, and even forcing\n\nthem to pay claims immediately at forfeiture,\n\nwell before a property is sold.\n\nThe merits

that circumstance, the Court said\n\nthere is no taking that requires compensation\n\nbecause the Court has never required the state\n\nto compensate the owner for the consequences of\n\nits own neglect.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about\n\nperspective?  It said, okay, we\u0027re having, you\n\nknow, a new regime in Minnesota, and everybody\n\nwho buys property here should know that it is\n\nsubject to whatever, escheatment or something\n\nto -- if the state needs it for a particular\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n80\n\nOfficial\n\nregulation, you get nothing.\n\nThat is how we define property.  The\n\nTakings Clause depends upon you having a\n\nproperty interest. We, the state, think it\u0027s\n\ndefined by state law. You no longer have that.\n\nMR. KATYAL: Right.  So we think, in\n\nthat hypothetical, if I understand it correctly,\n\nthat would state a Takings Clause violation\n\nbecause it is not a traditional way of\n\nunderstanding property.  It\u0027s not reasonable.\n\nOne way of understanding what is reasonable\n\nunder Texaco is to ask whether it is\n\ntraditional.\n\nAnd, here, the tradition of forfeiture\n\nof land starts, of course, with Statute of\n\nGloucester, Justice Gorsuch\u0027s favorite statute,\n\nbut then it moves on beyond that to statute\n\nafter statute at the founding, after the\n\nfounding, and so you can trace it back.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2022","index":"73","file_name":"Tyler v.

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS.\n\nMARTIN: Justice Kagan asked\n\nearlier, what\u0027s the limit on the county\u0027s view?\n\nAnd the answer is there is none. Under the\n\ncounty\u0027s theory, you can have exactly what\n\nhappened in Michigan when a county took an\n\nentire home that was worth at least $25,000, at\n\nleast that\u0027s what it fetched at an auction, over\n\nan $8.41 tax delinquency.  And you can have the\n\nsituation in Nebraska, where an elderly widow in\n\na nursing home lost her million-dollar farm over\n\na relatively small debt.  And I think the\n\nConstitution puts those limits.\n\nThe county suggests that due process\n\ncan do the work of the Takings Clause.  But it\n\ncan\u0027t. It -- it is not just compensation. And\n\nthis Court said in Jones versus Flowers that the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n113\n\nOfficial\n\nfailure to protect your property interests does\n\nnot excuse the government of its constitutional\n\nobligations.\n\nThe Court also noted in Jones versus\n\nFlowers that it is an extraordinary power to\n\ntake property and forcibly sell it to collect a\n\ntax debt. And, there, the statute at issue in\n\nthat state actually protected the surplus\n\nproceeds.
