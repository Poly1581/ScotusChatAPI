Security\n\nexercised his statutory discretion to make a\n\npolicy judgment.  He found that the benefits of\n\nMPP were outweighed by its domestic,\n\nhumanitarian, and foreign policy costs.  Yet,\n\nthe lower courts ordered DHS to reinstate MPP in\n\nperpetuity, requiring ongoing negotiations with\n\nMexico to send thousands of non-citizens into\n\nits territory. That was error.\n\nOn the first question, Section 1225\n\nconfers a discretionary return authority that\n\nthe Secretary may use, not a mandate.  Nothing\n\nin the statutory text or history compels DHS to\n\nuse MPP whenever Congress fails to provide\n\nsufficient funds for universal detention.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nRespondents identify no one who\n\ninterpreted Section 1225 this way before this\n\nlawsuit, no member of Congress or executive\n\nbranch official or anyone else.

I want to emphasize at the\n\noutset that we think that DHS is relying\n\npermissibly on its express statutory release\n\nauthorities here.  So it\u0027s the parole authority\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n8\n\nOfficial\n\nyou mentioned in 1182(d)(5).  It\u0027s also the\n\nauthority to grant bond or conditional parole\n\nunder Section 1226(a), which is a provision that\n\nRespondents largely ignore.\n\nSo we think that the releases are\n\nconsistent with those express authorities, and\n\nwe think that the language in 1225(b)(2)(A), the\n\n\"shall be detained\" language that you\n\nreferenced, should be interpreted against the\n\nbackdrop of long-standing principles of\n\nenforcement discretion, in recognition that this\n\nis essentially a limited law enforcement\n\nresource.  No one disputes that DHS does not\n\nhave sufficient capacity to detain everyone who\n\ncould be subject to detention under that\n\nprovision.\n\nBut I should say also that if you\n\ndisagree with everything that I just said or\n\nthink that there is more room for doubt about\n\nhow DHS implements those detention and release\n\nauthorities, still I don\u0027t think that provides","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"6","file_name":"Biden v.

say, well,\n\nwe can\u0027t do anything about it, what do we do?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I agree that\n\nit\u0027s not your problem in this case.  I think\n\nthat to the extent the Court interpreted the\n\nprovisions along the lines you\u0027re suggesting,\n\nthat that could, at most, support a judicial\n\norder that we need to detain more people or we\n\nneed to change how we\u0027re releasing people.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"9","file_name":"Biden v.

I\n\njust wonder whether the government has a view on\n\nit one way or the other.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Our view is that\n\nit -- that it also could foreclose review of\n\ndeclaratory relief, but I recognize the Court\n\ncould conclude otherwise.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why would it\n\nforeclose declaratory relief?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  I\u0027m sorry, Justice\n\nGorsuch, I\u0027m -- I don\u0027t have further information\n\nat this time. If you\u0027d like us to submit\n\nsupplemental briefing on this issue, we would be\n\nhappy to do so to try to clarify that position.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"17","file_name":"Biden v.

Farm-type issues.\n\nOne is that you said -- the -- the\n\nmemo says that the choice to bring people into\n\nthe country is because, otherwise, other more\n\ndangerous people would come into the country.\n\nIn other words, you have a choice between the\n\nless dangerous or more dangerous coming into the\n\ncountry.  That\u0027s on page 28 of the memo.\n\nAnd that strikes me as a false choice\n\nbecause the other option, of course, is to send\n\npeople to Mexico.  So that\u0027s one issue.\n\nThe other issue is I don\u0027t see -- and\n\nthis follows up on Justice Barrett\u0027s questions\n\n-- any real explanation in the October memo of\n\nwhat \"public\" means in \"significant public\n\nbenefit.\"  Is that the American public?  Is that\n\nthe non-citizen public?  Who is that?\n\nAnd if it\u0027s the American public,\n\nthere\u0027s no real explanation of how the public is\n\nbenefitted by more people coming into the United\n\nStates who are not lawfully admitted into the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n70","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"62","file_name":"Biden v.

Let me call to your\n\nattention 8 CFR 212.5, which discusses three\n\nkinds of circumstances among others that might\n\nsatisfy as one or the other, one being an\n\nindividual for whom essentially they\u0027ve got a\n\nmedical condition for whom detention is simply\n\nincompatible or will worsen it significantly,\n\nanother being a pregnant woman, and a third\n\nbeing an individual who is here to provide\n\ntestimony to a legislative adjudicatory or\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n88\n\nOfficial\n\nadministrative body.\n\nSo nothing in how this provision has\n\nbeen interpreted before, at least through those\n\nregulations, suggests that it would be a\n\nsignificant public benefit simply to not detain\n\nindividuals.  And that would be a very strange\n\nresult to consider given that Congress has made\n\nan unequivocal mandate that it wants detention,\n\ndoesn\u0027t just prefer it the way Petitioners have\n\nsuggested, it has unequivocally mandated that\n\nresult.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Congress\n\nmay want detention, but it hasn\u0027t come up with\n\nthe money to make -- to provide more beds,\n\nright?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"78","file_name":"Biden v.
