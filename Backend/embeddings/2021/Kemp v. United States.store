But that was dicta.\n\nThat case actually involved a mistake of fact,\n\nthe Mitchell case, not a mistake of law.\n\nAnd the main point on the California\n\ncases is they had the general rule that we are\n\nsaying, that \"mistake\" means mistake of fact,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n45\n\nOfficial\n\nnot law.
