what\u0027s difference from\n\nthis case in which the administration declines\n\nto appeal an adverse ruling?\n\nMR.\n\nBRNOVICH:  Justice Thomas, this\n\nwas an unprecedented legal maneuver.  What the\n\nDepartment of Justice did here when the\n\nadministration changed is literally not only\n\ndropped an appeal when this very Court had\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial\n\ngranted certiorari but then simultaneously\n\ndismissed four other appeals in the circuit\n\ncourts, that were pending before the circuit\n\ncourts, left in place one judgment in the\n\nNorthern District of Illinois, and then used\n\nthat district court decision to rescind a rule\n\nwithout going through the proper notice and rule\n\ncomment -- commenting.\n\nAnd so it is really unprecedented.\n\nFrankly, I\u0027m not aware of any other precedent\n\nwhere you have this types of maneuvers.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --\n\nMR. BRNOVICH:  In fact, just last\n\nyear, if my recollection is correct -- correct,\n\nthere was a pending criminal case where the new\n\nadministration felt like they couldn\u0027t defend\n\nthat case in good faith before this Court, and\n\nthis Court allowed another party to represent\n\nthose interests.  And I -- if I recall, it was a\n\n9-0 decision that ultimately the -- they\n\nprevailed.\n\nSo the key is -- is that the -- the\n\nadministration not only changed, but it refused\n\nand opposed the states intervening to protect\n\nour interests.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"5","file_name":"Arizona v.

Instead, Petitioners assert an indirect\n\neconomic interest in the rule\u0027s downstream\n\nconsequences.  Relying on predictions that were\n\nmade when the rule was drafted, they say that it\n\nwould cause DHS to deny adjustment of status to\n\npeople who would be more likely to use\n\nstate-funded public benefits at some point in\n\nthe future.\n\nBut we now know that those predictions\n\nwere wrong.  During the year that the 2019 rule\n\nwas in effect, we know that it affected only\n\nabout five of the approximately 50,000\n\nadjustment of status applications to which it\n\nwas applied or about 1-100th of 1 percent.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"35","file_name":"Arizona v.

God,\n\nI don\u0027t know what the answer is.\n\nAnd we don\u0027t\n\nhave to get into any of this mess if we can only\n\nget the Illinois case here in front of us.\n\nThat\u0027s why I keep asking, what should we do?\n\nMR. FLETCHER:  Justice Breyer, let me\n\nstart with the effect of the rule because I\n\nthink it\u0027s important to disaggregate a couple of\n\nthings.  The rule does apply to people seeking\n\nto come into the United States, to be admitted\n\nat the border, but it very, very seldom actually\n\nhas application there because the State\n\nDepartment has vetted those people before they\n\ncome if they are coming on a visa. If they\u0027re\n\nnot coming on a visa, if they\u0027re coming\n\nillegally, there are other grounds to deny them\n\nadmission.  So the rule has very, very little\n\npractical effect at the border.\n\nWhere it has effect -- and this had\n\nbeen common ground across all of the rulemakings\n\nand between the parties -- is in those\n\nadjustment of status decisions, where, as I\n\nexplained, it has turned out to have very little\n\neffect at all. So that\u0027s the practical stakes.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\nThe billions of dollars, I think it\u0027s\n\nimportant to understand, are not about the\n\nintended effects of the rule.

ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK\n\nBRNOVICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. BRNOVICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nI can\u0027t help but hearing my mom\u0027s\n\nvoice in my head that it\u0027s better to remain\n\nquiet and be thought of a fool than open your\n\nmouth and remove all doubt.\n\nBut I do think it\u0027s important for the\n\nrecord to emphasize that the question pending\n\nbefore this Court today and what seemingly none\n\nof us disagree with is whether the Ninth Circuit\n\nerred in denying Arizona\u0027s motion to intervene.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n100\n\nOfficial\n\nThe -- the answer to that question is\n\nclearly yes.  Nothing the Respondents have said\n\ntoday casts any real doubt on that.  It is,\n\nindeed, the Solicitor\u0027s prerogative to decide\n\nwhat rulings she may well appeal, but it is not\n\nher choice and her choice alone to determine\n\nwhether a party or a state can intervene in a\n\ncase.\n\nAnd, ultimately, if you allow the\n\nactions of the Department of Justice to stand in\n\nthis case, it sets a dangerous precedent for\n\nfuture administrations to essentially do an\n\nend-around the APA.\n\nThank you very much.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"89","file_name":"Arizona v.
