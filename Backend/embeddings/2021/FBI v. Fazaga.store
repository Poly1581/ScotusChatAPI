And if the entire\n\ndiscussion of the Ninth Circuit was premised on\n\nthis error about state secrets dismissals, one\n\nwouldn\u0027t have to get into that.

He said to posit, you\n\nknow, you have religion claims in the suit, and\n\nthe suit is about whether the surveillance\n\nviolated or discriminated on the basis of\n\nreligion.  But review of the application and the\n\nrelated documents shows that there was no\n\nreligious discrimination.  It was based on, you\n\nknow, very good evidence that the targets were\n\nterrorists.\n\nYou said in that circumstance, like,\n\nokay, well, then they\u0027ve asserted the state\n\nsecrets privilege, let the chips fall where they\n\nmay, that dismissal\u0027s not an appropriate remedy\n\nunder the state secrets privilege.

Several points.\n\nFirst of all, we think it makes sense\n\nthe proper disposition of the case is to review\n\nwhat the Ninth Circuit did decide, not what it\n\ndid not decide.  The Ninth Circuit did not\n\ndecide whether the district court\u0027s dismissal of\n\nonly the First Amendment claim was proper on the\n\nbasis of the state secrets privilege because it\n\nsaid the state\u0027s privilege was -- state secrets\n\nprivilege was displaced by FISA.\n\nAnd there\u0027s no doubt the privilege\n\nexisted clearly under Reynolds at the time that\n\nFISA was enacted.  So there is certainly no\n\nreason to think that FISA displaced that\n\nwell-established privilege.\n\nThe question of what the consequence\n\nof that privilege is not the privilege itself;\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"123","file_name":"FBI v.
