VERRILLI, JR.,\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nCongress enacted the statute at issue,\n\nwhich I will refer to as paragraph (14), to curb\n\nthe discretion HHS normally enjoys when it sets\n\nMedicare rates for outpatient hospital services.\n\nFor the drugs covered by the statute, paragraph\n\n(14) directs that the agency may set rates based\n\non acquisition cost and vary rates by hospital\n\ngroups if it conducts a cost study that meets\n\nthe requirements of the paragraph.\n\nIf it does not do a cost study, rates\n\nmust equal the average price for the drug\n\ndetermined by a cross-referenced statutory\n\nformula calculated and adjusted as necessary for\n\npurposes of the paragraph.\n\nNow, in the order at issue, HHS set\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nrates for Section 340B hospitals different from\n\nthe rates for all other hospitals and purported\n\nto base those rates on acquisition costs, but it\n\ndid not conduct the cost study that the statute\n\nrequires.\n\nNow, at the threshold, the government\n\nasserts that courts cannot review that agency\n\naction.  But no statutory text precludes review,\n\nand it makes sense that Congress would want\n\nreview because the point of paragraph (14) was\n\nto constrain agency discretion.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"American Hospital Assn. v.

The problem, of\n\ncourse, is that the data doesn\u0027t allow them to\n\nmake -- the data that the statute requires them\n\nto consider doesn\u0027t allow them to make those\n\ndistinctions because the data isn\u0027t broken out\n\nby hospital versus non-hospital purchaser.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you say on page\n\n44 the agency could adjust average price numbers\n\nto focus more closely on price paid by hospitals\n\nsince those numbers include other kinds of\n\nmedical providers as well.  So I took that to\n\nmean you can draw a distinction between\n\nhospitals and other providers.  Is that right?\n\nMR.

One is cost and 2 is\n\nprice. Now when you\u0027re supposed to use 2 is\n\nwhen cost fails.  You have no cost figures or\n\nthey\u0027re all a mess and you can\u0027t figure out\n\ncost, so now we go to 2, which is price.\n\nEverybody knows price isn\u0027t as good as cost\n\nbecause we\u0027re trying to get at the cost, but 2\n\nis about price.\n\nAnd so why would they put in there\n\npurposes, adjust for purposes, if they didn\u0027t\n\nmean price-based purposes?
