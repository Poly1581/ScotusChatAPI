Congress enacted ERISA to impose a\n\nduty Judge Friendly famously said was the\n\nhighest known to the law, a fiduciary duty.\n\nUnder ERISA Section 1104, a fiduciary managing\n\nassets in a retirement plan must act with\n\nprudence, solely in the interest of\n\nbeneficiaries, incur only reasonable expenses,\n\nand act with care, skill, and diligence.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit erred by\n\nannouncing a new rule that immunizes ERISA\n\nfiduciaries from suit for including imprudent\n\noptions so long as some of the plan options are\n\nprudent.  That holding is inconsistent with\n\nERISA\u0027s plain text, common law principles, and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nthis Court\u0027s precedents.\n\nIn Tibble, for example, this Court\n\nheld that a fiduciary has an ongoing duty to\n\nmonitor fund options and to remove imprudent\n\nones.

HUSTON: Well, Your Honor, I think\n\nthe fiduciaries have a fiduciary duty to fix\n\nthings if they have an opportunity to do so.\n\nThe fact that the complaint alleges, as Your\n\nHonor notes, that these fiduciaries went out in\n\n2016 and took some of the very steps that\n\nPetitioners allege they were required to take --\n\nand, specifically, they consolidated the plan\n\nlineup in order to gain access to institutional\n\nclass shares, and, as Mr. Frederick said, they\n\nobtained rebates from their existing\n\nrecordkeepers and lower costs -- the fact that\n\nthey did it, I would say, at the pleading stage,\n\nsupports the plausibility of Petitioners\u0027\n\nallegation that they could have done it sooner.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"43","file_name":"Hughes v.

These are funds that\n\nare offered to participants based on the target\n\ndate of their retirement, and they automatically\n\nbalance themselves.  And so you pick a fund,\n\nlike, if you want to retire in 2050, you pick\n\nthe 2050 life cycle fund.\n\nThe plans offered both the Fidelity\n\n2050 fund and the TIIA 2050 retirement fund.

is\n\nthat the number of people who are taking\n\nadvantage of defined contribution plans has gone\n\nup from 75 million to 109 million.  The number\n\nof plans has increased from 630,000 to almost\n\n700,000 in the period that we -- since we filed\n\nthis complaint.\n\nSo you cannot say as an empirical\n\nmatter that litigation is somehow causing a\n\nproblem.  The whole point of the Department of\n\nLabor\u0027s regulations was to bring reform to this\n\narea. Some universities acted prudently and did\n\nso quickly, and they saved their retirees lots\n\nand lots of money.
