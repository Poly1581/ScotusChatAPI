The\n\nCourt wasn\u0027t parsing the individual sections of\n\nthe Act and saying whether there\u0027s a specific\n\nindependent grant of jurisdiction.\n\nBut, ultimately, I don\u0027t think it\n\nmatters because there are only two ways to read\n\nSection 4.

the FAA\u0027s text treats requests\n\nto confirm or vacate arbitral awards as motions.\n\nMotions are not free-standing lawsuits that need\n\nan independent jurisdictional basis.  Rather,\n\nmotions seek relief within a larger controversy\n\nbetween the parties.  Courts thus assess their\n\njurisdiction by looking to that underlying\n\ncontroversy.\n\nHere, the FAA is structured\n\nsequentially to facilitate all stages of\n\narbitration to resolve the same underlying\n\ncontroversy.  Because FAA motions are adjuncts\n\nto that broader controversy, federal courts can\n\nhear FAA motions when they have jurisdiction\n\nover that controversy.\n\nSecond, Petitioner\u0027s approach would\n\ndecapitate the FAA.  The Act pervasively refers\n\nto federal courts.  But, in Petitioner\u0027s world,\n\nfederal courts can\u0027t hear most Section 9 and 10\n\nmotions.  They don\u0027t on their face raise federal\n\nquestions.  And most of the motions wouldn\u0027t\n\nsatisfy diversity jurisdiction either, like\n\nubiquitous zero dollar awards that reject the\n\nplaintiff\u0027s claim.  And uncontested motions to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nconfirm would fail adversarialness under Article\n\nIII.\n\nPetitioner says state courts are\n\nequally good. But, unlike the FAA\u0027s standards\n\nfor confirmation and vacatur, state courts often\n\nrevisit the merits under their own state\n\narbitration acts.\n\nCongress presumably did not want\n\nfederal courts to enforce arbitration agreements\n\nat the front end, only to see state courts to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"29","file_name":"Badgerow v.

BLATT: When you look at the Act,\n\nsort of, you know, unitary, harmonious,\n\ninterlocking, it is the -- they are motions\n\nbringing that are all adjuncts to a controversy.\n\nI mean, this is the Federal Arbitration Act, so\n\nthey were obviously thinking about cases that\n\ncould otherwise be litigated in federal court.\n\nWhether that\u0027s just diversity or a\n\nfederal question, these are federal question --\n\nfederal controversies, and these are treated as\n\napplications or requests to facilitate the\n\narbitration from cradle to grave.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your --\n\nbut it is the Federal Arbitration Act, but it\u0027s\n\nan odd creature in that, unlike most other\n\nfederal statutes, it doesn\u0027t by itself give rise\n\nto jurisdiction.  And it seems to me that one\n\nreason that -- why that is, is because they\n\nrecognize that people arbitrate all sorts of\n\ndisputes, and they didn\u0027t want all the 380,000\n\nwhatever cases being brought in federal court,\n\njust like you don\u0027t want the settlement\n\nagreements, the enforcement of that, being\n\nbrought in federal court just because it arose\n\nout of a federal case.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"41","file_name":"Badgerow v.

So I\u0027m just saying\n\nI think it\u0027s word games.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Blatt, I mean,\n\nthis might just be repeating my last question,\n\nbut there\u0027s a set of arguments one can make on\n\nboth sides about what would make for a sensible\n\nAct, so if we were writing the Act from scratch,\n\nhow we would write it to do the things we want\n\nit to do and not do the things we don\u0027t want it\n\nto do.\n\nBut I -- I -- I just want to put those\n\narguments aside and say that we\u0027re trying to\n\nmake sense out of the actual language that\n\nCongress offered, and then it seems as though\n\nthere are two different positions.  And one\n\nposition is we just sort of -- by some -- by the\n\nword \"motion\" and then by something, we just\n\nsort of, like, get that Congress meant for there\n\nto be look-through jurisdiction.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"46","file_name":"Badgerow v.

That\u0027s simply\n\nfalse. Cortez Byrd mentioned Section 4 when\n\nthey were comparing the terms \"may\" and \"shall.\"\n\nAnd they were looking for examples in the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act that used the permissive\n\nterm \"may\" versus the -- the mandatory term\n\n\"shall.\"\n\nIt specifically did not refer to\n\nSection 4 when it was listing other venue\n\nprovisions in the Act, and my friend has still\n\nnot cited a single case.
