FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nAs the government agrees, section\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(i) does not bar review of the\n\nagency\u0027s threshold determination that Mr. Patel\n\nis ineligible for adjustment of status.  That\n\nunderstanding is consistent with the statutory\n\ntext, context, and history, and it\u0027s also\n\nconsistent with this Court\u0027s explanation in\n\nKucana that the (B)(i) bar is limited to\n\ndecisions made discretionary by legislation.\n\nCongress could have written (B)(i)\n\ndifferently.  It could have barred review of any\n\nindividual determination, as it did in\n\nsubsection (A)(1), or of the final order of\n\nremoval, as it did in subsection (C).\n\nBut Congress didn\u0027t use those words.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Patel v.

just from the dictionary definitions that\n\nwere contemporaneous with the time, although\n\nthose did include a discretionary component.\n\nThey define \"judgment\" as notion,

was our position starting in 2001.\n\nI\n\nacknowledge that before 2001 the government took\n\nthe court of appeals\u0027 position.\n\nAfter St. Cyr,\n\nwhen it became clear there might be\n\nconstitutional issues with that position, the\n\ngovernment flipped, acknowledged its flip in\n\nlight of St. Cyr, and argued for the position\n\nthat we have now held since that time.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And I guess one of\n\nthe questions that comes up -- and this follows\n\non Justice Kagan\u0027s question -- is I think\n\nthere\u0027s a little bit of a mismatch between the\n\ngovernment\u0027s position starting in 2001 and the\n\nstatutory language of the provisions that\n\ninclude the subsequent REAL ID Act.\n\nSo I understand why the government in\n\n2001 would have said St. Cyr, we need to do\n\nsomething different.  And the courts of appeals\n\ncases were out there, as some of them were out\n\nthere at that time as well.\n\nBut then what St. Cyr said was\n\nquestions of law.  It didn\u0027t say discretionary.\n\nSo the government\u0027s position seems to be a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial\n\nlittle bit of a mismatch, which then becomes\n\nmore of a problem once you have the REAL ID Act,\n\nthe mismatch.

MEEHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nI\u0027d like to come back to some of the\n\nquestions about an alternative meaning of\n\n\"judgment\" and why that will still bar review\n\nhere. But, before I do that, I\u0027d like to start\n\nwith what I think is the only correct meaning of\n\n\"judgment\" as used by Congress here in the\n\njurisdictional bar.\n\n\"Judgment\" here means any decision\n\nwith a connotation of formality or\n\nauthoritativeness.  That formal decision or\n\njudgment is the overall denial of discretionary\n\nrelief.  Like all judgments, it subsumes any\n\ndiscretion -- subsidiary determination made\n\nalong the way to denying relief. So whatever\n\nthe reasons leading to the denial of relief, the\n\nresulting judgment is barred.\n\nThe only exceptions to that\n\njurisdictional bar are in subparagraph (d)\u0027s\n\nexceptions clause, precluding review of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\nconstitutional claims and questions of law.\n\nCongress left no doubt in 2005 that\n\nthese are the only exceptions.

The only way for him to get\n\nreview of that is not under the Eleventh\n\nCircuit\u0027s vision of the statute but under ours.\n\nCredibility is an issue of fact.  In\n\nthis Court\u0027s decision in Nasrallah, on page\n\n1693, the Court says those factual issues,\n\nregarding a Convention Against Torture order,\n\nmay range from the non-citizen\u0027s past\n\nexperiences in the designated country of\n\nremoval, to the non-citizen\u0027s credibility, to\n\nthe political or other current conditions of the\n\ncountry.  And the BIA in this very case referred\n\nto the issues as factual reviewed for clear\n\nerror.
