GEYSER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe 2017 Act\u0027s quarterly fee increase\n\npresents a clear and obvious violation of the\n\nBankruptcy Clause\u0027s uniformity requirement.\n\nCongress arbitrarily divided the country into\n\ntwo different groups and then authorized\n\ndifferent fees for identically situated debtors\n\nbecause their bankruptcies happened to arise in\n\ndifferent states.\n\nThere are no regional differences,\n\ndistinct local conditions, or industry-specific\n\nproblems justifying this non-uniform treatment.\n\nThe division is entirely artificial.

And a bifurcated system that\n\nimposes different charges on indistinguishable\n\ndebtors is not uniform under any ordinary\n\ndefinition.  Because the 2017 law is not uniform\n\non its face, it violates the Constitution, and\n\nthis Court should reverse.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Geyser, is the\n\nreal problem here as to lack of uniformity the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Siegel v.

GEYSER: Well, I -- I think two\n\nkey points, though.\n\nThe first is that in 2007, the\n\nJudicial Conference told Congress when Congress\n\nwas tinkering with the fees a little bit that it\n\nwould likely match them.  So Congress knew and\n\nthe Judicial Conference told Congress that they\n\nhave discretion and they may or may not act\n\nconsistent with the way they\u0027ve acted in the\n\npast.\n\nAnd in 2017, this was such a drastic\n\nincrease in fees, this is the first time the\n\nJudicial Conference would say:  Wait a minute,\n\nmaybe we should exercise our discretion and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n35\n\nOfficial\n\ndepart from past practice in making the fees\n\nequal.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"31","file_name":"Siegel v.

GEYSER: Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nOver the past 35 years, quarterly fees\n\npaid by Chapter 11 debtors have sometimes\n\ndiffered across districts, but those differences\n\ndid not violate the uniformity requirement of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Clause, as illustrated by the\n\nwide variations in fees that were permitted\n\nunder the first two bankruptcy acts enacted by\n\nCongress in 1800 and 1841.\n\nSuch fees are either not subject to\n\nthe uniformity requirement or their variation\n\ncomports with what this Court has called the\n\nflexibility inherent in the constitutional\n\nprovision.\n\nIn any event, Congress acted to avoid\n\nany potential non-uniformity in 2000 by adopting\n\nthe recommendation of the Judicial Conference to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"42","file_name":"Siegel v.

Conference adopted a standing order\n\ndirecting payment of the quarterly fees in the\n\nstatutory amounts \"as those amounts may be\n\namended from time to time.\"\n\nWhen Congress amended those amounts in\n\n2017, the failure of the bankruptcy\n\nadministrator districts to implement them in\n\ntime did not violate the uniformity requirement\n\nenclosed on -- imposed on Congress, which asked\n\nfor equal, not unequal fees.\n\nBut even if Congress had not requested\n\nequal fees, Congress was entitled to respond to\n\na shortfall of funding in the U.S. Trustee\n\nprogram by adopting a trustee-specific solution,\n\nand even if there were a constitutional\n\nviolation because of different fees, the\n\nappropriate outcome would not be refunding the\n\nincreased fees that Congress had required for\n\nthe districts that accounted for 97 percent of\n\nthe Chapter 11 filings but an invalidation of\n\nthe narrow exception for the bankruptcy\n\nHeritage Reporting

GANNON: We cited it for the\n\nproposition that there the Court recognized that\n\nit was another one of these cases where there is\n\ndisparate treatment, and the plaintiff, even\n\nthough he has established that the law in\n\nquestion was unconstitutional, it doesn\u0027t mean\n\nthat the plaintiff may get any practical relief\n\nat the end of the day in the terms of getting\n\nthe money back.\n\nInstead, the fix might be that there\n\nis no longer going to be discriminatory\n\ntreatment because the other guy is going to no\n\nlonger get the benefit.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The next -- we\u0027ve\n\nbeen acting as if the 2017 legislation was a\n\ndeliberate congressional choice to further a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n82\n\nOfficial\n\npilot program that involved disparate treatment.\n\nAt least that\u0027s been the supposition.\n\nBut that\u0027s actually wrong.

You look at the law that\n\nCongress passed, not what -- what political\n\nforces went into the law to sort of rewrite the\n\nterms that Congress actually chose.\n\nFor clawback as a remedy, I think that\n\nthe Chief Justice is exactly right that it would\n\nbe surprising for Congress to say let\u0027s go and\n\nfind every creditor, professional, administrator\n\nthat was involved in any of these closed cases,\n\ntrack them down and try to get them to pay their\n\npro rata share of the fee, which is what\n\nCongress would have to do to actually equalize\n\nthe treatment.\n\nI think that, as Justice Gorsuch\n\npointed out, there is a serious due process\n\nproblem, which my friend -- which my friend\n\nacknowledges.  And I think instead of resolving\n\none series of constitutional litigation, that\u0027s\n\na remedy that just invites a whole nother series\n\nof constitutional questions and brand-new\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"80","file_name":"Siegel v.
