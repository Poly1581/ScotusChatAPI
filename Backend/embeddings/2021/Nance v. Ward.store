HELLMAN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. HELLMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nMr. Nance\u0027s claim sounds in\n\nSection 1983 because it is a claim about how the\n\nstate may execute him, not a claim that the\n\nstate cannot execute him.  That simple\n\nproposition decides this case, and, indeed, when\n\nthe case began, Respondents did not dispute it.\n\nRespondents\u0027 new contention that some\n\nmethod-of-execution cases sound in habeas is\n\nwrong, wrong about the scope of the writ, wrong\n\nabout the scope of Section 1983, and wrong under\n\nthis Court\u0027s method-of-execution case law.\n\nProposing a non-statutory method of\n\nexecution is proposing a method of execution.\n\nBy its very nature, the claim does not attack\n\nthe validity of the death sentence, which places\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Nance v.

Let me see if I can\n\nattempt to respond to your question.\n\nUltimately, what we have here is a question of\n\nfederal law because the scope of habeas --\n\nfederal habeas and the scope of Section 1983 are\n\nfederal questions.\n\nAnd we know from the Malloy case, as\n\nJustice Sotomayor referred to, that simply going\n\nfrom one punishment to another, at least without\n\nmore, doesn\u0027t present an ex post facto concern.\n\nThe scope of what state law does, I\n\nsuppose, could vary in some other state, but as\n\nto what Georgia law does, there\u0027s no question.\n\nAnd I point the

believe, in that\n\ncase that resentencing -- that -- that it was a\n\nchallenge to the death penalty itself.\n\nAnd the Court said no, that is not the\n\ncase as a matter of Georgia law.

And to Justice Kavanaugh\n\nand Justice Kagan\u0027s questions, a dual track\n\nsystem would add procedural complexity, creating\n\ndelay and inviting gamesmanship.\n\nFor instance, a claim that alleges\n\nmultiple alternatives could proceed in separate\n\nactions in different venues, or a case may have\n\nto restart in a different court if a prisoner\n\namends his complaint or if an appellate panel\n\nrevives an alternative rejected by the Court.\n\nAnd there\u0027s no compelling doctrinal\n\nreason for that approach.  In fact, it would\n\nexpand the scope of habeas to hold that a purely\n\nstate law problem that does not invalidate a\n\ncriminal judgment can somehow transform an\n\naction into a core habeas claim.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose we were to\n\nagree with the state in this case.

The federal government -- of\n\ncourse, federal prisoners do not use Section\n\n1983, but they use the APA.  And in the\n\nmethod-of-execution litigation that the federal\n\ngovernment handled in 2020 and 2021, the\n\nprisoners did use the APA. Many claims were\n\njoined together.\n\nAt some point in that suit, the\n\nprisoners added a firing squad alternative, and\n\nwe do think that if there were a dual track\n\nsystem, there would have been all kinds of\n\nprocedural complications to what was already a\n\nvery complicated and difficult litigation that\n\nwould have made it substantially more difficult.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I follow up on\n\nthat?

And what do\n\nwe do about the fact that in the verdict form\n\nthe jury indicated it would be death by lethal\n\ninjection?\n\nMS. HANSFORD:  So, Justice Gorsuch,\n\nit\u0027s unclear what that meant on the verdict\n\nform. It was part of the language on the\n\nverdict form, but it\u0027s not clear what that meant\n\nbecause lethal injection was the only\n\nstatutorily authorized method.  And so -- and\n\nthe judgment didn\u0027t repeat those words.\n\nBut I think the reason that that feels\n\nsignificant is that it seems like it may suggest\n\nthat Georgia is a state that actually defines a\n\nsentence to be death by lethal injection.

HANSFORD:  I think -- I think that\n\nis where a lot of the -- of the activity is.\n\nAnd that\u0027s one of the reasons the dual track\n\nsystem would be so unwieldy, because that is the\n\nsame question, regardless of the alternatives,\n\nand then splitting the claim up to litigate\n\nwhether the firing squad is readily implemented\n\nversus a different protocol really does not make\n\na lot of sense and creates the possibility for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial\n\ncompeting stays being entered, which -- which is\n\nalso not helpful to the litigation.\n\nAnd just to say one more thing on the\n\nprotections that are available even under\n\nSection 1983, I just want to emphasize the very\n\nimportant protection of the limits this -- this\n\nCourt set out in Hill on the stays.  And, in\n\nfact, I think the Hill -- the aftermath of the\n\nHill case is itself a good example.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"41","file_name":"Nance v.

He also included a\n\nclaim in his federal habeas petition that his\n\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to raise\n\nthese sorts of claims.  So Nance himself is kind\n\nof the advertisement for the fact that these are\n\navailable all the way along the line.\n\nBut what I take Bucklew to say is the\n\nclaim itself shouldn\u0027t be hard in terms of\n\nfinding an alternative, but it specifically left\n\nopen that where you do that, whether you do it\n\nin state court or federal court, might be, you\n\nknow, a question because, if you are going to\n\nstop the warden from executing you, period,\n\nthat\u0027s habeas relief.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t make that\n\nclaim.
