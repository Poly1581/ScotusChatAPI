MORRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Fifth Circuit recognized a new\n\ncause of action based on an elected body\n\ncensuring a member.  That decision is wrong for\n\ntwo reasons.  First, it ignores this country\u0027s\n\nhistory and parliamentary tradition, which\n\nrecognize the right of elected bodies to govern\n\ntheir own affairs, including censuring members\n\nfor violations of governance rules.  And,\n\nsecond, it makes the Free Speech Clause into\n\nboth a cudgel and a shield.

the First Amendment\n\nmatters is because, just as in Tenney with\n\nlegislative immunity, I think the idea is that\n\nthe Constitution\u0027s grant of the disciplinary\n\npower and the expulsion power reflects a\n\nwell-understood, universal, long-established\n\ntradition of legislative bodies.\n\nAnd then the idea there between -- you\n\nknow, in -- by analogy to cases like Tenney and\n\nBogan against Scott-Harris, because it\u0027s such a\n\nwell-developed and well-understood power of\n\nthese elected bodies, even in states or in\n\nlocalities where it hasn\u0027t expressly been\n\ncodified in the Constitution, we should presume\n\nthat unless some provision of positive law\n\nremoves the power, that it exists by virtue of\n\nthere being an elected body.\n\nAnd so I

given that, our argument\n\nthere doesn\u0027t work.\n\nSome of the other arguments\n\nin the briefs --\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Is there some\n\nconceptual reason to draw a distinction?\n\nMR. JOSHI: I suppose I would turn to\n\nthe distinction this Court drew in Minnesota\n\nRepublican Party against White, in which it said\n\nbecause there wasn\u0027t a history of elected judges\n\nand because the early elected judges shortly\n\nafter the founding really were sort of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n37\n\nOfficial\n\npoliticians in robes, they would run judicial\n\ncampaigns, that that lack of history suggested\n\nthat a rule preventing the judge from speaking\n\non important matters of public interest might\n\nviolate the First Amendment.\n\nAnd so I think that would be the sort\n\nof analysis you would say, is that, if there\n\nisn\u0027t the history to back it up, then I think\n\nyou have to resort to sort of more traditional\n\nFirst Amendment analysis.  In a case like this,\n\nI suppose it might be, would a similarly\n\nsituated person or judge of ordinary firmness\n\nhave been chilled?\n\nBut that\u0027s exactly the kind of\n\nanalysis I think you don\u0027t need to get to here\n\nbecause, as this Court has said in a variety of\n\ncontexts, when the history is clear -- and the\n\nhistory is clear that this sort of exercise of\n\ndiscipline does not abridge the member\u0027s freedom\n\nof speech -- that essentially resolves the\n\nquestion presented.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"32","file_name":"Houston Community College Sys. v.
