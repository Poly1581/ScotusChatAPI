Sure, when one is comparing Brecht and\n\nChapman, you can compare into which one is\n\nfriendlier to a -- a criminal defendant.\n\nHowever, the AEDPA overlay asks different\n\nquestions, and that is not what that specific\n\njudge thinks but whether there is fair-minded\n\ndisagreement.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I hear you on\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial\n\nthat.

That\u0027s the purpose, isn\u0027t it? Pay\n\nattention, federal habeas judge, to the fact\n\nthat those are good judges over there too, and\n\nthey came out the opposite.  You say it was\n\nharmful, but they said no reasonable -- beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, it was -- it was harmless.\n\nPay attention to it.\n\nSo why don\u0027t we just say that?  Why\n\ndon\u0027t we just say this is one of the questions\n\nwhere, if you ever have such a situation,\n\nfederal habeas judge, please pay some attention?\n\nAnd -- and instead of writing it in a legal\n\nstandard that no one can understand, just tell\n\nthem what to do:  Pay some attention.\n\nNow I grant you that would leave it\n\nall up to them.  It would be very hard to\n\nreview.  But we leave lots of things to district\n\njudges.

BAHAL: Thank you, Justice\n\nKavanaugh.  This Court has made clear, first in\n\nHolbrook and again in Deck, that relying on\n\njuror testimony as to whether the effect of\n\nshackles affected their verdict is unreliable\n\nbecause a juror will not always be aware of the\n\neffect of seeing a defendant in shackles.  It\n\nhas sort of a subconscious effect on the jurors.\n\nAnd so it is not at all surprising that a juror\n\nwas not able to testify on the remand\n\nproceedings that -- that, yes, I saw the\n\nshackles and, yes, they affected the verdict.\n\nThis Court recognized in Holbrook and\n\nDeck that the effect of shackling is implicit in\n\nthe juror and they will not be able to\n\narticulate the reasons why the shackling is\n\nprejudicial.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And a second\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n45\n\nOfficial\n\nquestion.

AEDPA is an overlay on Chapman.\n\nAnd, essentially, what we decided in Ayala and\n\nin Fry is that even with that AEDPA overlay, the\n\nBrecht standard doesn\u0027t get close to -- the\n\nChapman standard doesn\u0027t get close to the Brecht\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n52\n\nOfficial\n\nstandard.\n\nMS. HAMMOUD: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nThe question -- AEDPA was not at play in Fry.\n\nAnd never once, and the Court in Ayala\n\nreaffirmed that, did it displace AEDPA.\n\nAnd the Court in Ayala went through an\n\nextensive analysis, and I understand the two\n\nsentences that talk about \"subsumes.\"  And this\n\nis why this case is a perfect vehicle for this\n\nCourt to apply both of the tests and distinguish\n\nbetween the different standards, the different\n\nlimitations, the different burdens, but this\n\nCourt in Ayala went through and did an extensive\n\nanalysis showing how Ayala did not meet the test\n\nunder Brecht and separately under AEDPA/Chapman.\n\nAnd that\u0027s what we\u0027re asking the Court","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"48","file_name":"Brown v.
