MARTIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe question this case presents is\n\nwhether the Restoration Act subjects the Pueblo\n\nto Texas\u0027s time, place, and manner restrictions\n\nas it relates to games that Texas does not\n\nflatly prohibit.\n\nIt does not. In the Restoration Act,\n\nCongress codified the Cabazon Band framework and\n\nspecifically foreclosed Texas\u0027s regulatory\n\nauthority over the tribe\u0027s gaming activities.\n\nThe plain language of the Act provides\n\nus with clear support for this interpretation.\n\nOn the heels of this Court\u0027s decision in\n\nCabazon, Congress changed the language of the\n\nRestoration Act to replicate the prohibitory/\n\nregulatory dichotomy struck in Cabazon.

It\n\nfederalizes Texas law but only as to prohibited\n\ngames. And bingo, in the State of Texas, is not\n\na prohibited game.\n\nSection 107(b) clearly forecloses any\n\ninterpretation of Section 107 in its entirety\n\nwhere Texas would have regulatory jurisdiction\n\nover tribal gaming.  And Section 107(b) must\n\nhave meaning in the Act.\n\nThe problem with the State of Texas\u0027s\n\ninterpretation and the Fifth Circuit\u0027s\n\ninterpretation in Ysleta I is that it reads","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v.

YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nJust six months after this Court drew\n\nthe distinction in Cabazon under Public Law 280\n\nbetween gaming activity that is prohibited\n\nversus gaming activity that is regulated by\n\nstate law, Congress enacted Section 107,\n\nmirroring that language to draw the same\n\ndistinction in the exact same Indian gaming\n\ncontext.\n\nSection 107(a) forbids a tribe from\n\nengaging in gaming activities that are\n\nprohibited under Texas law, and Section 107(b)\n\nfurther provides that Section 107(a) does not\n\ngrant the state civil or criminal regulatory\n\njurisdiction.\n\nTexas has conceded in this Court that\n\nSection 107(b) restates the limits of Public Law\n\n280. Those limits draw directly from Cabazon,\n\nthey limit state regulatory jurisdiction, and\n\nthey make clear that Section 107 adopts the\n\nCabazon framework.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"33","file_name":"Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v.

Its effort to extend Cabazon Band\n\nsuffers from three primary faults.\n\nFirst, it ignores that when it comes\n\nto gambling, the Restoration Act departs from\n\nthe Cabazon Band framework by treating both\n\ncivil and criminal penalties and civil and\n\ncriminal regulatory jurisdiction the same way.\n\nSecond, it overlooks that the Cabazon\n\nBand test was written to avoid a form of state\n\nencroachment into tribal affairs that isn\u0027t\n\npossible when a federal court is applying\n\nfederal law.\n\nAnd, third, it depends on a definition\n\nof jurisdiction that disregards the close tie\n\nbetween that term in the 1980s and an\n\nadjudicator\u0027s ability to decide a case. That\u0027s\n\nhow it\u0027s used in Public Law 280, in\n\nSection 105(f), and, as Justice Kagan noted, in\n\nSection 107(c).\n\nApplying that same definition to\n\n107(b), regulatory jurisdiction encompasses a\n\nstate administrative agency\u0027s ability to\n\nexercise oversight through, among other things,\n\nreporting requirements, inspections, and\n\nultimately enforcement actions, not the state\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n68\n\nOfficial\n\nlarger ability to set substantive limits on\n\ngambling.\n\nI welcome this Court\u0027s questions.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, could you\n\ngive me an example of a regulatory law or rule\n\nthat applies -- a gaming -- a regulation of\n\ngaming laws that applies to tribes that do not","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"61","file_name":"Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v.

PETTIT: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  The second is 107(b),\n\nwhich specifically talks about criminal\n\nregulatory jurisdiction. Now there\u0027s a question\n\nas to what kinds of -- what kind of jurisdiction\n\nit\u0027s talking about here because jurisdiction is\n\nused in two different senses in this statute,\n\nbut I think that Mr. Yang has an awfully good\n\nargument that when they\u0027re talking about\n\nregulatory jurisdiction, they\u0027re not talking\n\nabout it in the which court sense, they\u0027re\n\ntalking about it in the Cabazon sense.\n\nSo -- so it says, you know, we don\u0027t\n\nwant to give the state regulatory jurisdiction,\n\nmeaning the state doesn\u0027t have any regulatory\n\npower here.\n\nThen the third thing would be what\n\nJustice Barrett said, I think you\u0027ve responded\n\nto that, the other statutes passed around the\n\nsame time, actually, on the same day, right,\n\nthat clearly understand the Cabazon\n\nprohibitory/regulatory distinction.\n\nSo you take all of those together, and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n78\n\nOfficial\n\nthis is what I meant when I said to Mr. Yang\n\nCabazon is, like, written all over this statute.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"70","file_name":"Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v.

PETTIT: So, in Cabazon, this\n\nCourt used the phrase \"regulatory authority,\"\n\nnot \"regulatory jurisdiction.\"  When referring\n\nto the power to set laws, this Court has\n\ntypically used the term \"legislative\n\njurisdiction,\" which is tellingly not the word\n\nthat Congress had selected.\n\nMoreover, the -- and I would point --\n\nhe made a comment post-Arbaugh that you try to\n\nbe more careful about jurisdiction.  I think\n\nthat in the 1980s there was a very clear tie\n\nbetween jurisdiction and an adjudicative\n\nofficer, not necessarily a court.  And I would\n\npoint you to the Fifth Edition of Black\u0027s Law\n\nDictionary, which was published in about 1983,\n\nwhich specifically discusses jurisdiction in\n\nthose terms.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n79\n\nOfficial\n\nSo it may not be a court-specific\n\nterm, but absent the phrase \"legislative\n\njurisdiction,\" it does tend to have an\n\nadjudicative meaning.

I believe Justice Alito asked a\n\nfew minutes ago how you determine whether you\n\nare going to apply a canon about assuming\n\nCongress -- or it might have been Justice Kagan\n\n-- I apologize -- about when you assume Congress\n\nwas understanding the particular context.\n\nNormally, this Court does that when\n\nyou have a well-established term that\u0027s been\n\nused a number of times, whereas, here, you have\n\njust the term \"prohibit,\" which is a commonly\n\nused statutory term, it\u0027s been interpreted once\n\nin a case that respectfully is not the most\n\nprecise case this course -- Court has ever\n\nissued.  And so assuming that Congress intended\n\nto enact and make permanent for all tribes for\n\nall uses of \"prohibit\" based on this one case\n\nwould be taking that canon too far.\n\nAnd the best way I think I can point\n\nthis to is differences between the language of\n\nIGRA, which, for example, does track Cabazon\n\nBand in that it says prohibits \"as a matter of\n\ncriminal law or public policy\" in 2701(5).\n\nThat\u0027s not the phrase that we have in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n82\n\nOfficial\n\n-- in the Restoration Act.
