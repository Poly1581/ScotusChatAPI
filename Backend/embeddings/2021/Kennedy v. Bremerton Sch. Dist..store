The -- the problem of\n\nprayer in school has been the fact that -- that\n\nthere are 54 different religions in the United\n\nStates now, and so what -- going back to the\n\n18th Century, 17th Century, what we\u0027re worried\n\nabout is maybe it\u0027s -- here, it was the\n\nSatanists, but, I mean, it could be, you know,\n\nthe Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Shintos,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n35\n\nOfficial\n\nMohammedans, and one group thinks why this group\n\nis being favored by the school, the other one\n\nthinks what about this one and so forth.

Right\n\nafter the game, right before the bell rings in\n\nthe morning, the teacher, the coach, says let us\n\npray, prays out loud, and students join.\n\nAnd, indeed, this one told all the\n\npress, so there were going to be a lot of people\n\nthere.

CLEMENT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice. Just a few points in rebuttal.\n\nFirst, in terms of the correct test, I\n\ndon\u0027t think the correct test when the government\n\nexplicitly discriminates on the basis of\n\nreligion is Pickering.  Religion is different.\n\nIn the context of free speech, we\u0027re\n\nused to saying, well, if you just spoke over\n\nthere, you had alternative methods of\n\ncommunication, time, place, and manner, there\u0027s\n\nsome flexibility on that.  That doesn\u0027t happen\n\nin religion because it\u0027s a compelled, sincere\n\nreligious belief.  If you tell a Muslim if they\n\ncould just reorient themselves in the other\n\ndirection, you\u0027re denying them their religious\n\nexercise.  So you need a test that is fit for\n\nreligion cases, and strict scrutiny provides\n\nthat.\n\nIf you want to give courts and\n\ndistrict courts -- rather, school districts\n\nguidance, the last thing you should do is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n109\n\nOfficial\n\nreplace jurisprudence that\u0027s becoming clearer\n\nand could be made clearer in this case about\n\ndiscrimination against religion and the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"100","file_name":"Kennedy v.

parents complaining about their\n\nstudents who had to turn their back on the team\n\nor separate themselves from team activity,\n\nobviously directed at the pre-September 17th\n\nactivity that\u0027s no longer at issue in the case.\n\nThere\u0027s no evidence of coercion in this record.\n\nBut, worse still, I mean, my client\n\nhas already waited six years to get his job\n\nback. And if you imagine the parallel for this\n\nis a race case where the lower courts, both\n\nlower courts, said the sole reason the\n\ngovernment acted was because of race, but yet we\n\nthink it\u0027s okay because there\u0027s this compelling\n\ninterest.
