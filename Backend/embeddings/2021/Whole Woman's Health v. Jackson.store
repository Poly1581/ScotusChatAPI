STONE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nPetitioners\u0027 pursuit of an injunction\n\nsuffers from two fundamental problems.\n\nFirst, none of the individuals that\n\nPetitioners sued are appropriate defendants\n\nunder well-established Article III and equitable\n\nprinciples.\n\nSecond, Petitioners ask for an\n\nexpansion of access to the federal courts that\n\nonly Congress and not this Court may provide.\n\nPetitioners\u0027 Article III and equitable\n\nproblems begin with what they really want, an\n\ninjunction against S.B. 8, the law, itself.\n\nThey can\u0027t receive that because federal courts\n\ndon\u0027t issue injunctions against laws but against\n\nan -- but against officials enforcing laws.  No\n\nTexas executive official enforces S.B. 8 either,\n\nand so no Texas executive official may be\n\nenjoined.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"40","file_name":"Whole Woman\u0027s Health v.

extraordinary controversy in the United\n\nStates and in Minnesota about the federal court\n\nreview, and that itself didn\u0027t exist before Ex\n\nparte Young.\n\nIn other words, that was an extension\n\nof preexisting doctrine to recognize a problem\n\nthat the Chief Justice was identifying with\n\ndeprivation of constitutional rights and\n\nchilling on the ability to get judicial review.\n\nSo Ex parte Young sets out this\n\nprinciple that you can get pre-enforcement\n\nreview in federal court against state\n\nenforcement of laws that are assertedly\n\nunconstitutional.  And 999 times out of a\n\nthousand or maybe every time until this case,\n\nthat\u0027s a state executive official.  It\u0027s a pro\n\nforma exercise usually to identify the state\n\nexecutive official.\n\nAnd Justice Kagan points out there\u0027s a\n\nloophole that\u0027s been exploited here or used\n\nhere, which is the private suits are enforced by\n\nstate court clerks or judges.  So the question\n\nbecomes, should we extend the principle of Ex\n\nparte Young to, in essence, close that loophole?\n\nIn other words, put aside the language in Ex\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"55","file_name":"Whole Woman\u0027s Health v.
