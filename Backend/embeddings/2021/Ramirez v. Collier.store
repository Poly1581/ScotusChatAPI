KRETZER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nAcross Texas\u0027s 572 executions spanning\n\nfour decades, the State\u0027s policy was to allow a\n\nspiritual advisor to be present in the execution\n\nchamber to lay hands on a condemned inmate and\n\nto audibly pray.\n\nIn 2019, that long-standing practice\n\nchanged suddenly when the State chose to forbid\n\nany religious advisor from the execution\n\nchamber.  Ramirez and other inmates fought to\n\npreserve their religious exercise rights to\n\nspiritual advisor presence, and while these\n\nchallenges proceeded, the State withdrew\n\nRamirez\u0027s 2020 execution date in exchange for\n\nwithdrawal of his Section 1983 petition.\n\nSix months later, the State reset\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nRamirez\u0027s execution, followed two months after\n\nthat by a reversion to allowing in chambers\n\nspiritual advisor presence.

In\n\nparticular with Alabama, I think the Court,\n\nhowever it\u0027s going to set down rules, needs to\n\nmake sure it\u0027s really engaging in an\n\napples-to-apples comparison.\n\nThe request in Alabama was much\n\nbriefer.  I understand that it was a brief touch\n\nwith holy oils to essentially administer the\n\nlast rights, and that\u0027s something significantly\n\nless intrusive risk-wise than what\u0027s being\n\npresented in Texas.\n\nAll else equal, if someone in Texas\n\nwere to -- if someone in Texas were to present\n\nthat same request as in Alabama, the fact\n\nAlabama was able to provide it would be a piece\n\nof evidence, not necessarily dispositive, but at\n\nleast something to the extent that Alabama has a\n\nsimilar execution protocol and a similar\n\nexecution room.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n95\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"84","file_name":"Ramirez v.

In other words, you know, in Holt,\n\nprison officials came in and said men can put\n\ncontraband in their beards and we have a\n\nsecurity interest in preventing that.\n\nAnd what the Court said was, you know\n\nwhat, I mean, that might be, but we\u0027re going to\n\nlook around at other states, see what other\n\npractices are.  To the extent most other states\n\nor many other states can deal with the security\n\ninterests in a way that also respects religious\n\ninterests of the inmate, then we\u0027re going,\n\nessentially, to, you know, say to the state why\n\nnot you too?\n\nAnd in all of that, there is an\n\nappropriate level of deference given to prison\n\nofficials, but there\u0027s also an appropriate level\n\nof respect given to the inmate with religious\n\nconvictions, as commanded by Congress.\n\nMR.
