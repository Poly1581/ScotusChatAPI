CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe text of the Second Amendment\n\nenshrines a right not just to keep arms but to\n\nbear them, and the relevant history and\n\ntradition, exhaustively surveyed by this Court\n\nin the Heller decision, confirm that the text\n\nprotects an individual right to carry firearms\n\noutside the home for purposes of self-defense.\n\nIndeed, that history is so clear that\n\nNew York no longer contests that carrying a\n\nhandgun outside of the home for purposes of\n\nself-defense is constitutionally protected\n\nactivity.  But that concession dooms New York\u0027s\n\nlaw, which makes it a crime for a typical\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nlaw-abiding New Yorker to exercise that\n\nconstitutional right.\n\nThis Court in Heller labeled the very\n\nfew comparable laws that restricted all outlets","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"2","file_name":"New York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Assn. v.

But\n\nthe difference between a sensitive place law and\n\nNew York\u0027s regime is fundamental.  It is the\n\ndifference between regulating constitutionally\n\nprotected activity and attempting to convert a\n\nfundamental constitutional right into a\n\nprivilege that can only be enjoyed by those who\n\ncan demonstrate to the satisfaction of a\n\ngovernment official that they have an atypical\n\nneed for the exercise of that right.\n\nThat is not how constitutional rights\n\nwork.

So I think you do need to make those\n\nkind of adjustments, but I think those\n\nadjustments can be made.\n\nI think, really, there are two reasons\n\nto at least be skeptical of post-1871 history.\n\nI mean, the first is I just don\u0027t really\n\nunderstand why it\u0027s terribly relevant in forming\n\nthe original public meaning of the Constitution.\n\nBut, of course, the second reason is it\u0027s just\n\nabout that time that the collective rights view\n\nstarted to creep into the decisions of some\n\nstate supreme courts.\n\nAnd I think -- so in Heller is a\n\nperfect example that this Court didn\u0027t\n\nabsolutely stop its analysis in 1871, but, when\n\nit looked at those later sort of postbellum\n\nstate supreme court decisions, the ones that\n\nrelied on a collective rights view were given\n\nvery short shrift.  And I think that\u0027s the\n\nappropriate way to sort of deal with these\n\nhistorical analogs.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"7","file_name":"New York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Assn. v.

Thank you, Justice\n\nGorsuch.\n\nI\u0027d say just a couple of quick things\n\nabout the Statute of Northampton.\n\nFirst of all, I think that it was very\n\nclear from the Knight\u0027s Case and the treatises\n\nthat this Court relied on in Heller that by the\n\ntime of the framing of the English Bill of\n\nRights, that was not a general prohibition on\n\ncarrying outside the home but was a prohibition\n\non either carrying unusual and dangerous weapons\n\nor using common weapons in a way that terrorized\n\nHeritage Reporting

FLETCHER: There have been those\n\narguments made, and there\u0027s certainly evidence\n\nthat those sentiments existed in New York at the\n\ntime. I have not seen things that persuade me\n\nthat those were the impetus for the Sullivan\n\nLaw.\n\nAnd to the extent that that was a\n\nquestion, I think the fact that similar laws\n\nhave been enacted and maintained not just in New\n\nYork and not just at that moment in time but in\n\na number of different states throughout the\n\ncountry throughout large swaths of our nation\u0027s\n\nhistory is -- is good reason to believe that\n\nthis is not just prejudice, that this is a\n\nlegitimate regulation.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  I think one more\n\nquestion about the major point that you\u0027ve made\n\nthis morning, which is that there are scattered\n\nstatutes, local ordinances, judicial decisions\n\nfrom various points in the 19th Century\n\nextending into the 20th Century, the early 20th\n\nCentury, with the Sullivan Law and the other\n\nlaws that you mentioned that are inconsistent\n\nwith Mr. Clement\u0027s argument.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"93","file_name":"New York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Assn. v.

FLETCHER:  I appreciate the\n\nquestion, Justice Gorsuch, and I think our view\n\nis that courts ought to follow what we\n\nunderstand to be the lesson from Heller, which\n\nis that you start with text, history, and\n\ntradition, and when those sources provide you an\n\nanswer one way or the other, either that the law\n\nis valid or that it\u0027s invalid, you end there and\n\nthat\u0027s the end of the inquiry.\n\nWe take that approach to be consistent\n\nwith the approach described by Justice Kavanaugh\n\nin his dissent in Heller II. I think the one\n\nplace where we might differ from him a little\n\nbit is that we think there may come a point,\n\nespecially as -- when courts confront new\n\nregulations, where history gives out, where it\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n115\n\nOfficial\n\nnot possible to draw those historical analogies\n\nanymore.\n\nAnd at that point, our suggestion is","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"102","file_name":"New York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Assn. v.

Just a few quick points in rebuttal.\n\nFirst of all, I want to highlight that\n\nwhen the government was asked for its interest\n\nbehind this permitting regime, it said that if\n\nit went to a different regime, it would multiply\n\nthe number of firearms in circulation.\n\nIn a country with the Second Amendment\n\nas a fundamental right, simply having more\n\nfirearms cannot be a problem and can\u0027t be a\n\ngovernment interest just to put a cap on the --\n\nthe number of firearms.\n\nAnd that just underscores how\n\ncompletely non-tailored this law is.  It might\n\nbe well tailored to keeping the number of\n\nhandguns down, but it\u0027s not well tailored to\n\nidentifying people who pose a particular risk or\n\nanything else because it deprives a typical New\n\nYorker of their right to carry for self-defense.\n\nThe second point I want to make is\n\njust about population density.

It\u0027s telling that\n\nhis first example is Tennessee.  If you look at\n\nthe Heller decision, Tennessee is a problematic\n\nstate in terms of its history.  The court gave\n\n-- that Tennessee Supreme Court first came out\n\nwith the Aymette decision, which the majority\n\nopinion in Heller criticized.  It then came out\n\nwith the Simpson decision and the Andrews\n\ndecision, both of which protected Second\n\nAmendment rights, and the majority opinion in\n\nHeller praised those decisions at the same time\n\nthat it criticized Aymette.

The cost of this kind\n\nof discretion is that people are charged with\n\nviolent crimes even though they have no private\n\n-- no prior record just because they are trying\n\nto exercise their constitutional right to\n\nself-defense.\n\nAnd if you want to know how this\n\nimpacts policing, one of the ways essentially\n\nmaking everybody in New York City a presumptive\n\nperson who is unlawfully carrying is that leads\n\nto stopping and frisking everybody.\n\nThe framers, I think, had a different\n\nvision of the Fourth Amendment and the Second\n\nAmendment, and that is that individuals get to\n\nmake their decision about whether or not they\n\nwant to carry a firearm outside the home for\n\nself-defense.\n\nIn 43 states, people are able to do\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n123\n\nOfficial\n\nthat. It has not -- it doesn\u0027t mean everybody\n\nends up carrying, and it doesn\u0027t mean that those\n\n43 states have any more problems with violent\n\ncrimes or anything else than the six or seven\n\njurisdictions that don\u0027t honor the text, the\n\nhistory of the Second Amendment, and Heller.\n\nThank you, Your Honors.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2021","index":"109","file_name":"New York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Assn. v.
