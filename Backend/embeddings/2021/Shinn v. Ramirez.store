ROYSDEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe issue presented in this case is\n\nfundamentally a question of statutory\n\ninterpretation.  When Congress enacted\n\n2254(e)(2) as part of AEDPA, it created a high\n\nbar for federal evidentiary hearings on habeas\n\nclaims involving state convictions.\n\nIt codified the first part of the\n\nKeeney test in the opening part of (e)(2) by\n\nechoing the words \"failure to develop\" from\n\nKeeney.  And this Court, in Williams and\n\nHolland, has already held that attorney\n\nnegligence counts as failure to develop under\n\n(e)(2) based on agency principles.\n\nIf a failure to develop has occurred,\n\nCongress did not merely repeat Keeney and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nColeman\u0027s cause and prejudice test for excusing\n\nit but, rather, supplanted it by specifying in\n\nsubsections (A) and (B) of (e)(2) the cause and\n\nprejudice required.\n\nCongress thus spoke clearly, and the\n\ncourts\u0027 role is to apply the statutory language.\n\nThat no fact-finder could have found the\n\nprisoner guilty is not enough.
