It is simply a threshold\n\nprediction of the likelihood of success based on\n\na truncated record and an initial, often hasty\n\nassessment of the law that may well prove to be\n\nfaulty as the case proceeds.

A couple of responses to\n\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nFirst, it\u0027s not sufficient for an\n\ninterlocutory order because there\u0027s been no\n\ndetermination that the defendant has violated\n\nfederal law or that the plaintiff\u0027s claim\n\nactually succeeds on the merits.\n\nAnd, second, at least certainly in a\n\nsituation such as this one, the plaintiffs got\n\nwhat they wanted, but, ultimately, they got what\n\nthey wanted because the Virginia legislature\n\nrepealed the statute.  So they didn\u0027t ultimately\n\nget the relief that they wanted from the court.\n\nAnd --\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, but they did.\n\nThey got interim relief.

It was\n\nnever reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone\n\nby a final decision, which is all that Sole\n\nsaid. And we have never required a final\n\njudgment.

MALEY: Ultimately, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, I think Petitioner\u0027s rule is the more\n\njudicially efficient one.  Respondents\u0027 rule\n\nwill create a number of perverse incentives,\n\nincluding incentives on defendants to avoid\n\nmootness by freezing challenged rules in place.\n\nAnd while it\u0027s true that Petitioner\u0027s\n\nrule may lead plaintiffs to try and avoid\n\nmootness, if a defendant concludes that further\n\nfactual or legal development is unlikely to lead\n\nto a change in the preliminary injunction","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"17","file_name":"Lackey v.

Sole versus Wyner thus\n\ndetermined that a preliminary injunction\u0027s\n\ntentative character makes a fee request at that\n\npreliminary initial stage premature.  And after\n\nthat, in this case, the case became moot due to\n\nlegislative action that Buckhannon teaches does\n\nnot confer prevailing party status.\n\nNow, while a plaintiff whose case is\n\ndismissed might not lose on the merits, Section\n\n1988 does not award fees to non-losing parties.\n\nIt requires prevailing party status.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"22","file_name":"Lackey v.

There are certain discrete\n\ncommon law exceptions that have evolved.  At\n\nequity, for instance, the common fund exception,\n\nyou get a fund.

SCHMALZBACH:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Rebuttal?\n\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIKA L. MALEY\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS. MALEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nI\u0027d like to start with your point that\n\nonce you depart from a bright-line rule that a\n\nfinal judgment or a conclusive determination on\n\nthe merits of at least one claim is what\u0027s\n\nrequired, then the rule becomes extremely\n\nambiguous as to what could potentially qualify\n\nfor prevailing party status.\n\nA lot of interlocutory orders can be\n\nappealable and can be said in some sense to give\n\nsome benefit to the plaintiff, and yet those\n\norders do not fall within any understand --\n\ntypical understanding of the legal term of art\n\nprevailing party.\n\nI think you can also see the ambiguity","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"80","file_name":"Lackey v.

Review\n\nAs Justice Kavanaugh put it, the circuits really\n\nare at sea on this question. And the sheer\n\nnumber of published court of appeals cases\n\ngrappling with these scenarios shows that the\n\ntests the circuits have adopted are not readily\n\nadministrable.  They\u0027re fact-intensive and\n\nunpredictable, and they\u0027re frequently sparking a\n\nsecond major litigation over the availability of\n\nfees, which in and of itself is highly\n\njudicially inefficient.\n\nSecond, I\u0027d like to discuss Justice\n\nKagan\u0027s point that a preliminary injunction is\n\nreally a way station and not the final\n\ndestination, not what a party is seeking in\n\nbringing suit. And they often occur in a very\n\ncompressed time frame without full development\n\nof the record or the legal arguments such that\n\nthe final judgment might be different.\n\nOf course, the final judgment might\n\nnot be different, but, when that final judgment\n\nis never reached, there\u0027s no way to tell what\n\nthe court ultimately would have held on the\n\nmerits of the claim.\n\nAnd, third, I\u0027d just like to agree\n\nwith Justice Gorsuch\u0027s point that the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"81","file_name":"Lackey v.
