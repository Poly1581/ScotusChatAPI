Presumably, if the\n\ngovernment thought that this statute was\n\ndivisible, they would have argued it, but I\n\nthink your question really highlights an\n\nimportant point, which is it just so happens\n\nthat this murder statute can be satisfied either\n\nby acts or omissions.\n\nBut the government\u0027s argument would\n\nhave to be the same even if New York had a\n\nmurder-by-omission statute that could only be\n\nsatisfied by a pure omission in which there was\n\nno actus reus whatsoever, other than just having\n\na duty that you failed to satisfy.
