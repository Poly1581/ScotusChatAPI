It is not an\n\nall-purpose fraud statute against the\n\ngovernment.\n\nI think the reason for that is that at\n\nevery juncture from the 1986 amendments to the\n\n2009 amendments, Congress has made adjustments\n\nto the False Claims Act, but it has never --\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah.

The\n\nadministrator pays on the government\u0027s behalf\n\nusing money the government collects and controls\n\nto advance a federal program that the government\n\ncreated.\n\nFCC mandates, which the administrator\n\nmust follow, specify who must be paid and how\n\nmuch they must be paid.  So, when the\n\nadministrator paid Wisconsin Bell, that was the\n\ngovernment providing money through its agent.\n\nIndeed, many government programs,\n\nincluding most notably Medicare, use private\n\nclaims administrators to provide billions of\n\ndollars to beneficiaries of government programs.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"39","file_name":"Wisconsin Bell, Inc. v.

We\u0027d know exactly what the government\u0027s\n\nfinancial stake was.\n\nBut this is private money from private\n\nparties to another private party, and it\u0027s very\n\ndifficult to see what the government\u0027s financial\n\nstake is. And I think it\u0027s -- it -- you might\n\nultimately conclude, or we might, that it is\n\nenough to be federal funds.  But it doesn\u0027t look\n\nlike federal funds.  It looks like private\n\nfunds.\n\nSo, in this -- in this instance, would\n\nyou explain exactly what the government\u0027s\n\nfinancial stake is here?  It hasn\u0027t appropriated\n\nany monies, it hasn\u0027t given any grants, and it\n\nhasn\u0027t lost anything.  No matter what happens\n\nhere, the government\u0027s not out of pocket.\n\nMR.

Review\n\nstart with part of the premise I\u0027m not sure I\n\nagree with.  As Ms. Ho admitted in the first\n\npart of the argument, this is treated for budget\n\npurposes as a permanent indefinite\n\nappropriation.  The appropriation is located in\n\nthe Telecommunications Act, so it\u0027s not a\n\nyear-to-year appropriation where a specific\n\namount of money is designated, but it is treated\n\nfor budget purposes as appropriated funds.\n\nAnd so, to the extent that that\u0027s\n\nsignificant, I think it\u0027s satisfied here.  Such\n\npermanent indefinite appropriations are pretty\n\ncommonplace throughout the federal budget, and\n\nso that piece of the premise I\u0027m not sure I\n\nagree with.\n\nBut I take the point that there are\n\naspects in which the funding structure of this\n\nprogram is unusual, that there is less\n\ngovernment touching the money than there might\n\nbe for other federal programs. And, as I said\n\nin my introduction, I just don\u0027t think that that\n\ncan be dispositive as to the question whether\n\nthe federal government is providing the money.\n\nOn the specific question of what has\n\nthe government lost, I think, if you look at\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"42","file_name":"Wisconsin Bell, Inc. v.

they\u0027re supposed\n\nto get come from the government as well.\n\nAnd so I think, if you have concerns\n\nabout how the program is structured, those are\n\nreally concerns for another case, not

We think that\n\nthe right way to make the government whole is to\n\ntake the entire claim amount.  They may argue\n\nthat it\u0027s the delta.

They are\n\nappointed to be the permanent administrator by\n\nvirtue of FCC regulations.  They receive -- they\n\nhave regular oversight meetings with the FCC.\n\nThey get letters and phone calls telling them\n\nwhat to do.  And, of course, they have a bunch\n\nof regulations telling them what to do as well\n\nand the memoranda of understanding.\n\nIf they breach the terms of that, the\n\nFCC can correct them.  If they refuse to be\n\ncorrected, the sanctions can go as high as them\n\nlosing their job, which would be kind of\n\nsimilar, I think, to what would happen to\n\nfederal employees.
