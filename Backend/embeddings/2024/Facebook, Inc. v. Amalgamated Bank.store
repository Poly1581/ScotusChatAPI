SHANMUGAM:  Sure.  So a couple\n\npoints in response to that, Justice Thomas.\n\nThe first is that we don\u0027t think that\n\na reasonable person would draw that inference\n\nfrom a statement of this variety.  Where a\n\nstatement says, if something occurs, harm may\n\nfollow from that, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a necessary\n\npremise of that statement that the event has\n\nnever occurred.

I mean, if you think of the\n\ntypical investor and you say in the first\n\nversion of the hypothetical, yes, the typical\n\ninvestor would think it\u0027s kind of misleading for\n\nyou to make this statement that\u0027s framed\n\nentirely in a hypothetical if, in fact, there\u0027s\n\nno more plant and no more production capacity,\n\nso too the reasonable investor is going to say,\n\nwell, if there\u0027s been such substantial damage to\n\na plant that production capacity is operating at\n\n50 percent or 30 percent or 10 percent, you\n\nknow, that too is going to be of interest to the\n\ninvestor for the exact same reason.\n\nAnd I guess what that suggests to me\n\nis that this inquiry is more contextual than\n\nyour position allows for.\n\nMR.

And\n\nthe government points to the fact that there was\n\na time when an earlier version of Item 105\n\nrequired at least some disclosures of that\n\nvariety.  That\u0027s all well and good.

Isn\u0027t it inherently\n\nforward-looking? When you want to know about\n\nwhat risk you face, you want to know what your\n\nrisk is in the future, right?\n\nMR.

First, as to the actual question\n\npresented, we agree that a risk disclosure is\n\nnot misleading because it omits disclosure of an\n\nevent that is immaterial because it risks no\n\nbusiness harm. The Ninth Circuit did not hold\n\notherwise.\n\nSecond, we agree that in addition to\n\nproving materiality, plaintiffs must also show\n\nthat the risk statement implies that the omitted\n\nevent did not occur.  We don\u0027t claim that every\n\nrisk statement includes that implication.  Our\n\nposition is simply that they can and frequently\n\ndo, and that ultimately depends on the facts and\n\ncontext of each case.\n\nThird, for that reason, the Court\n\nshould reject Facebook\u0027s categorical rule that\n\nItem 105 statements are always agnostic about\n\nwhether the risk has transpired in the past.\n\nFacebook admits that if a student tells his\n\nparents that there\u0027s a risk he may fail an exam\n\nwhen he\u0027s already done so, that is misleading\n\nbecause it implies it\u0027s impossible that he won\u0027t\n\nwhen that isn\u0027t true.

BARBER: Well, so I think that the\n\nproblem with that, Justice Barrett, is that the\n\nother circuits don\u0027t apply the virtual certainty\n\nrule in the way that Petitioners say they do.\n\nWhat the other circuits say -- what\n\nmost circuits say is: A risk statement can be\n\nfalse or misleading if either, A, the risk has\n\nalready materialized, which is our case, or, B,\n\nthe risk hasn\u0027t materialized, but it\u0027s virtually\n\ncertain to do so.  And that\u0027s fine.

Half-truth\n\nclaims are not limited to that particular\n\ncontext.\n\nThe reason why we\u0027re in that situation\n\nhere is that if a company isn\u0027t subject to a\n\ndisclosure requirement like Item 105, then they\n\ndon\u0027t have much incentive to go around the\n\nmarkets telling people how risky their\n\ninvestments might be in the company. So I think\n\nthat\u0027s important.\n\nBut I also do disagree at a second\n\nlevel that Item 105 just doesn\u0027t ever require\n\ndisclosure of past events, because what it\n\nrequires disclosure of is material factors that\n\nrender an investment in the company risky or\n\nspeculative, and that can readily encompass past\n\nevents, present conditions, and potential future\n\nevents.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"96","file_name":"Facebook, Inc. v.

SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  Four points.\n\nFirst, let me start with Respondents\u0027\n\nand the government\u0027s test. Mr. Russell said\n\nthat under their test, risk disclosures can and\n\nfrequently do imply something about the past.\n\nBut, as Justice Kagan asked, the devil is in the\n\ndetails.  How do you determine when risk\n\ndisclosures fall on that side of the line?\n\nFrom Respondents\u0027 and the government\u0027s\n\nbrief, it seemed like their answer was the\n\nmateriality requirement.  If omitted information\n\nis important to a reasonable investor, then the\n\nrisk disclosure contains an implication about\n\nthat.\n\nBut there are a couple of problems\n\nwith that.
