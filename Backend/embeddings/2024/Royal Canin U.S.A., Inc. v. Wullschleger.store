ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE B.\n\nWELLINGTON\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMS.\n\nWELLINGTON:  Mr. Chief Justice,\n\nand may it please the Court:\n\nThe Eighth Circuit\u0027s decision below is\n\nan extreme outlier.  It conflicts with the text\n\nand structure of Section 1367 and with more than\n\na century of precedent.  Chief Justice Marshall\n\nheld in Mollan against Torrance in 1824 that in\n\na diversity case, a federal court\u0027s jurisdiction\n\nonce vested cannot be divested by subsequent\n\nevents.\n\nThe Court extended that reasoning to\n\nremoval actions in Kirby against American Soda\n\nin 1904.  And in 1938, this Court held in St.\n\nPaul Mercury that if the plaintiff after removal\n\namends his pleadings, this does not deprive the\n\ndistrict court of jurisdiction because the\n\ndefendant\u0027s statutory right to removal should\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nnot be subject to the plaintiff\u0027s caprice.  The\n\nsecond Justice Marshall confirmed that\n\nconclusion in Carnegie-Mellon against Cohill in\n\n1988, and Justice Scalia concurred in Rockwell\n\nin 2007.\n\nRespondents ask this Court to upset\n\nthat settled interpretation, claiming that it\n\nconflicts with the text of Section 1367. But\n\nCongress codified this Court\u0027s longstanding\n\nprecedent in the text of Section 1367 itself,\n\nmaking clear that if the federal court has\n\noriginal jurisdiction, it shall continue to have\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction unless Congress\n\nexpressly provided otherwise.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"2","file_name":"Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v.

Let\u0027s say this was an original\n\ncase and it was brought in federal court, and\n\nthen the plaintiff took out the federal claim,\n\nleaving only state claims.  Is there\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction there?\n\nMS. WELLINGTON:  So this Court has\n\ntreated these two situations differently, and\n\nJustice Scalia explained why in Rockwell.  So\n\nthere was a concern in Rockwell that when a\n\nplaintiff goes into federal court, pleads a\n\nfederal question, and then immediately or\n\nsubsequently drops it, that they\u0027re trying to\n\nplead their way into federal court.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  So forgetting what the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"4","file_name":"Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v.

And I don\u0027t\n\nunderstand why the federal court can be divested\n\nof jurisdiction if it starts in federal court\n\nbecause the plaintiff brought it -- brought it\n\nthere but can\u0027t be divested of jurisdiction if\n\nit comes to federal court because the defendant\n\nbrought it there.\n\nMS.

KELLER: Yeah, a couple of\n\nresponses to that, Justice Kagan.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u0027t think that we,\n\nmeaning this Court, has ever embraced that rule.\n\nIt\u0027s true that the lower courts deserve\n\nrespectful consideration, but a lot of these\n\ncases predate binding statutory text, so I\u0027m not\n\nsure that that\u0027s dispositive.\n\nAlso, I would respectfully submit that\n\nyou\u0027re the supervisory Court that\u0027s most\n\nimportant in our Article III system.  And when\n\nyou\u0027re hearing a question for the first time,\n\nyou ought to adjudicate it correctly,\n\nnotwithstanding the respectful consideration\n\nthat you would give to the lower courts.\n\nAnd if you\u0027ve determined, as it sounds\n\nlike you have, that from first principles I\u0027m\n\nright, the fact that lower courts that obviously\n\ncan\u0027t bind this one got it wrong I don\u0027t think\n\nis a reason to just say let\u0027s go along to get\n\nalong.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"49","file_name":"Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v.

CAFA makes it a\n\nlot easier to remove cases into federal court.\n\nSo, in the mine-run case, they\u0027re going to have\n\nno difficulty.\n\nThe difficulty that they face here is\n\nthat you have no diversity of any kind. CAFA\n\nobviously eliminates complete diversity and goes\n\nto minimal diversity as the standard, but that\u0027s\n\na relatively unusual circumstance.  Oftentimes,\n\nplaintiffs are trying to seek a nationwide class\n\nor something broader.\n\nSo I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to wreak\n\nhavoc because the incentives are still going to\n\nbe there when there\u0027s widespread harm for\n\nplaintiffs to pursue classes that include\n\ncitizens from many different states.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, we\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n59\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2024","index":"52","file_name":"Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v.
