FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, let me\n\nexplain a few reasons why you shouldn\u0027t\n\nconsider this a new criminal prosecution.\n\nFirst, it arises in the context of\n\nactive supervision by probation officers.\n\nThey\u0027re not simply reacting to arrests.\n\nThey\u0027re going out and supervising and trying to\n\nreintegrate these defendants into the\n\ncommunity.\n\nSecond, the revocation proceedings are\n\ninitiated by probation officers, not by\n\nprosecutors. Prosecutors could ask the\n\nprobation officers to do it, but it\u0027s\n\nultimately up to the probation officers whether\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n29\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nto do so.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"25","file_name":"United States v.
