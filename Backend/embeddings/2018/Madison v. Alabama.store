STEVENSON\n\n12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n13 MR. STEVENSON: Yes. Thank you.\n\n14 I just want to stress and invite this\n\nCourt to look at the Eleventh Circuit pleadings\n\n16 where the state took the exactly opposite\n\n17 position.\n\n18 There has been no point prior to this\n\n19 Court where the state has acknowledged that\n\ndementia would be a basis on which a court\n\n21 could find someone incompetent to be executed.\n\n22 Their brief, the post-hearing brief that they\n\n23 filed after the hearing begins, \"Initially, it\n\n24 must be noted that Madison has failed to\n\nimplicate Ford or Panetti in this proceeding.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n59\n\n1 Both the court-appointed expert and the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"54","file_name":"Madison v.

And what\n\n6 we\u0027ve argued is that dementia in this case\n\n7 renders Mr. Madison frail, bewildered,\n\n8 vulnerable in a way that cannot be reconciled\n\n9 with executing him because of his incompetency.\n\nThe state never acknowledged that\n\n11 argument as a base -- a valid argument. The\n\n12 court never made a finding about that argument.\n\n13 And we believe that when you consider the facts\n\n14 of his dementia and this Court\u0027s holdings, that\n\na determination that executing someone in this\n\n16 condition cannot be reconciled with an Eighth\n\n17 Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual\n\n18 punishment.\n\n19 And for that reason, this awesome\n\npower that the state has requires obligations,\n\n21 requires oversight. And, here, the state\n\n22 didn\u0027t meet those obligations and oversight by\n\n23 making the informed determination that his\n\n24 dementia does not leave him so incapacitated\n\nthat he is competent -- incompetent to be\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n62\n\n1 executed. They never said anything about\n\n2 dementia.\n\n3 And so I don\u0027t think this Court can\n\n4 rely on the argument that somehow, in this\n\ninvisible record, with no reference to dementia\n\n6 by the state, by the expert, or by the court,\n\n7 that that determination has been found.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"57","file_name":"Madison v.
