O\u0027CONNELL ADAMS: Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis Court recognized in Burr that a\n\nsue-and-be-sued clause need not be read to\n\nwaive immunity for absolutely everything that\n\nthe agency could be sued for. It described\n\ncategories of claims that might not be allowed,\n\nnotwithstanding a purportedly broad waiver of\n\nimmunity.\n\nDiscretionary-function immunity, which\n\nis grounded in constitutional separation of\n\npowers principles and preexisted the enactment\n\nof the Federal Tort Claims Act, is precisely\n\nthe type of immunity that Congress had in mind\n\nwhen that -- and it would have expected to\n\nsurvive.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"26","file_name":"Thacker v.
