WALL: Justice Ginsburg, for the\n\n16 reasons I gave earlier, I think the Court could\n\n17 on this record or it could remand. As long as\n\n18 the Court doesn\u0027t DIG, both because it would\n\n19 leave standing, a judgment that I think the\n\nCourt had no jurisdiction to enter, and I think\n\n21 it would encourage parties not to flag\n\n22 jurisdictional issues at the cert stage, as the\n\n23 parties here should have.\n\n24 And just to say one word about the\n\nmerits, I do think if the Court reaches the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n35\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"30","file_name":"Frank v.

question of the costs of identifying the\n\n2 plaintiffs.\n\n3 In this kind of case, where the\n\n4 question at the outset is, is it worth the\n\ncandle to try and identify the claimants\n\n6 because

The cy\n\npres doctrine comes out of -- and it\u0027s inaptly\n\n16 named -- from the notion that what -- someone\n\n17 who gets a reward, someone who gets an award,\n\n18 can repurpose it to a different thing, to a\n\n19 different purpose, if the current -- if the\n\nexisting purpose isn\u0027t used -- feasible.\n\n21 So, for example, we cite the Beastie\n\n22 Boys examples. Private parties regularly will\n\n23 get an award or a settlement, but they can\n\n24 actually, instead of having that settlement\n\ncome to them, go to a third-party for their\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial\n\n1 benefit.\n\n2 And the question in this case is, is\n\n3 there anything in Rule 23(e) that says that\n\n4 classes, that class representatives, where it\u0027s\n\nfair, reasonable, and adequate, cannot do\n\n6 exactly what the Beastie Boys or any other\n\n7 private party can?\n\n8 And Rule 23(e) doesn\u0027t answer that\n\n9 question by saying never. It answers that\n\nquestion by providing a standard of fairness,\n\n11 reasonableness, and adequacy.\n\n12 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: The question\u0027s\n\n13 what reasonableness means.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"48","file_name":"Frank v.
