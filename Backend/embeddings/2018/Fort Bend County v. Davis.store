SINZDAK: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\n\nI think the important question with respect to\n\njurisdiction is whether the agency has been\n\nempowered to attempt to resolve a claim.\n\nI don\u0027t think whether the resolution\n\n-- the way that it resolves it, whether --\n\nwhether -- the way that it\u0027s been empowered to\n\nresolve it, whether it\u0027s adjudicatory or\n\nnon-adversarial, I don\u0027t think that matters.\n\nWhat matters is whether Congress vested\n\nauthority in the agency to attempt to resolve\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nit.\n\nAnd I think, with respect to Title\n\nVII, it\u0027s correct, the agency is not using\n\nadversarial proceedings. And that\u0027s because,\n\nas we know, Congress intended for employment\n\ndiscrimination claims to be resolved in a\n\nnon-adversarial manner, to be resolved through\n\nconciliation or cooperation or means like that.\n\nAnd so it wanted the agency to have the power\n\nto do that.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"3","file_name":"Fort Bend County v.

And I have a general point and a Title\n\nVII-specific point.\n\nThe general point is that Title VII --\n\nor that Thunder Basin applies where you have\n\ntwo jurisdictional grants that are undisputedly\n\naddressing the adjudicatory authority of courts\n\nand agencies and you\u0027re just applying ordinary\n\nprinciples to reconcile where the boundary line\n\nis between them.\n\nArbaugh is about when you have a\n\nparticular box that a plaintiff must check to\n\nget relief, is that jurisdictional at all?\n\nAnd for all the reasons the Court gave\n\nin Arbaugh, we think that you should assume it\n\nis not jurisdictional unless Congress says\n\notherwise.\n\nThe Title VII specific response is\n\nthat for three reasons Thunder Basin wouldn\u0027t\n\napply here.\n\nFirst, in Thunder Basin and Elgin, you\n\nhave a statute that arguably has peeled back by\n\nimplication 1331. We know that\u0027s not true in\n\nTitle VII because Arbaugh said so and because\n\nthe point of Title VII\u0027s jurisdictional\n\nprovision was to expand jurisdiction.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"52","file_name":"Fort Bend County v.
