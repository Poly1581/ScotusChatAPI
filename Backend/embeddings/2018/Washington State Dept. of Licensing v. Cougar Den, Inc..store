If Cougar Den\n\nbrought this fuel into Washington and\n\n6 immediately put it into a tank on the other\n\n7 side of the state line, they would still owe\n\n8 the tax even if they never traveled any\n\n9 farther.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the -- the --\n\n11 the tax legislation taxes a wide range of\n\n12 activities. One is it taxes fuel that\u0027s\n\n13 removed in the state from a refinery, but the\n\n14 one that\u0027s being applied here is that it taxes\n\nmotor vehicle fuel entering into this state.\n\n16 So entering into, this is a pretty\n\n17 standard importation tax, which is to say that\n\n18 it\u0027s taxing the travel of goods into the state,\n\n19 which, again, seems to be what the Yakama got\n\nas a result of this treaty: the ability to\n\n21 take goods to market and to take goods from\n\n22 market, regardless where that market is.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"15","file_name":"Washington State Dept. of Licensing v.

UNIKOWSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\n21 The Yakama treaty preempts the\n\n22 application of the fuel tax to Respondent for\n\n23 two reasons. The first reason is that, when\n\n24 Respondent transports fuel, it exercises the\n\nright to travel secured by the Yakama treaty.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n36\n\nOfficial\n\n1 As such, it has right -- the right to do that\n\n2 without incurring a tax obligation, regardless\n\n3 of whether this tax is styled as one on\n\n4 possession or transportation.\n\nSecond, even if this case turned on\n\n6 what the tax is on, this really is a tax on\n\n7 transportation because that\u0027s what the statute\n\n8 says and that\u0027s how the state court construed\n\n9 it as a matter of state law.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if -- if\n\n11 this -- these were apples coming into the State\n\n12 of Washington and there was a fee to -- but\n\n13 they inspected the apples to make sure they\n\n14 weren\u0027t diseased and the people who owned the\n\napples had to pay that fee, is that problematic","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"33","file_name":"Washington State Dept. of Licensing v.

Well, first of all, I\n\n16 think that, as applied to fuel that comes in\n\n17 from out of state, really, first possession\n\n18 just is inherently importation.\n\n19 In other words, you can\u0027t be the first\n\npossessor of fuel, at least that originates out\n\n21 of state, unless you\u0027re the one hauling it into\n\n22 the state.\n\n23 So, in that context, I just think\n\n24 first possession

The broader\n\n8 argument actually doesn\u0027t depend on what the\n\n9 statute says. It depends on what the tribal\n\nmember is doing.\n\n11 So, if the tribal member can show that\n\n12 the only thing that they\u0027re doing is exercising\n\n13 a treaty right, which is to say transporting\n\n14 goods to market, then they don\u0027t pay the tax,\n\nno matter how the statute is styled.\n\n16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then that\u0027s very","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"40","file_name":"Washington State Dept. of Licensing v.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: That seems to be\n\n3 an argument that it\u0027s a sham, that it\u0027s really\n\n4 getting to transportation. \"Sham\" might be too\n\nstrong a word, but it\u0027s not -- it\u0027s

UNIKOWSKY: So I think, under the\n\n9 broadest possible version of our argument, we\n\nprobably -- but I\u0027m not going to push this very\n\n11 hard -- I think it would be preempted, but I\u0027m\n\n12 not going to push it very hard because I think\n\n13 that this really is a transportation tax.\n\n14 I think it\u0027s actually quite helpful to\n\nlook at why the statute is written the way it\n\n16 is, to understand why we really think this is a\n\n17 transportation tax. So I get that the overall\n\n18 goal of the state is to ensure that all fuel\n\n19 sold at retail is subject to a tax.\n\nBut the natural way to do that is to\n\n21 just to tax the retail sale, but this Court has\n\n22 held in the Chickasaw Nation case that those\n\n23 types of taxes are preempted.

should look to what is the full\n\n22 scope of activities that the state is trying to\n\n23 tax and why they have this tax.\n\nAnd according\n\n24 to them, they have this tax because they want\n\nto get to every single taxpayer who possesses\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n63\n\nOfficial\n\n1 fuel in the state.

UNIKOWSKY: So, of course, I think\n\n7 it\u0027s the activity. And I think that your\n\n8 question is really what this case boils down\n\n9 to.\n\nAnd I think there\u0027s a lot of reasons\n\n11 why the former answer is correct and the latter\n\n12 is not. First of all, I just think that the\n\n13 treaty right focuses on the Indian\u0027s right. It\n\n14 says the Indian has the right to trade and --\n\nto travel, excuse me. I don\u0027t see a focus on\n\n16 sort of the holistic intent of the state and\n\n17 why it\u0027s enacting a particular tax.\n\n18 Also, I think, in the Wagnon case, the\n\n19 whole argument by the tribe in that case is\n\nthat what the state was really trying to do was\n\n21 burden things on the reservation.

Those laws were the ultimate\n\n9 generally applicable laws. They applied to\n\nIndians and non-Indians.

But I think that\n\n14 ultimately that\u0027s a state law question, not a\n\nfederal question.

talked about the treaty canon so far because I\n\n13 think neutral principles are more than\n\n14 sufficient to resolve this case for Respondent,\n\nbut at least under the -- the generous\n\n16

securing for\n\nthemselves the right to travel across it.\n\n21 I think that it\u0027s very natural and\n\n22 consistent with what I think the expectation of\n\n23 the Yakamas would have been, that

They don\u0027t pay the tax. Only\n\n9 the user who buys it pays the tax, correct?\n\nMR. UNIKOWSKY: Yes.

And the state court said, which I\n\n4 think is intuitive, that importation is a\n\nspecies of transportation.\n\n6 And so there is an authoritative\n\n7 decision that this statute taxes\n\n8 transportation. So --\n\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem in\n\nthis is that it\u0027s not consistent. You\u0027re\n\n11 right, the wholesalers, licensed wholesalers\n\n12 are the importers, but they don\u0027t pay the tax.\n\n13 MR. UNIKOWSKY: Yeah. So this is not\n\n14 a tax on first possession. It just doesn\u0027t\n\nwork that way.
