WALL\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. WALL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\n11 The only damages theory in this\n\n12 monopolization action is rooted in a 30 percent\n\n13 commission that Apple charges app developers\n\n14 and which allegedly causes those developers to\n\nincrease app prices to consumers.\n\n16 The case is barred by the Court\u0027s\n\n17 Illinois Brick doctrine because the developers\u0027\n\n18 pricing decisions are necessarily in the causal\n\n19 chain that links the commission to any consumer\n\ndamages.\n\n21 If the commission increases beyond the\n\n22 competitive level, but apps developers do not\n\n23 change their apps prices, consumers suffer no\n\n24 damages. And if app developers do change their\n\nprices to pass on some or all of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 over-charge, well, that is precisely the kind\n\n2 of damages theory that the Illinois Brick\n\n3 doctrine prohibits.\n\n4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any -- in\n\n-- in your view, is there any first buyer in\n\n6 this picture?\n\n7 MR.

And if they don\u0027t -- and they only\n\nchange by virtue of a decision which implicates\n\n6 everything this Court talked about in Hanover\n\n7 Shoe, in Illinois Brick, and in UtiliCorp.\n\n8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Wall, I\n\n9 think you\u0027re avoiding the question a bit\n\nbecause, I mean, the questions that are being\n\n11 put to you by my colleagues are really, what\n\n12 was Illinois Brick about? Was it about a\n\n13 vertical supply chain or, instead, was it about\n\n14 a pass-through theory?\n\nNow, in the facts of Illinois Brick\n\n16 and, indeed, in the facts of all the Illinois\n\n17 Brick cases that we\u0027ve discussed, you had both.\n\n18 So you didn\u0027t have to separate the two.\n\n19 And now, here, you don\u0027t have both,\n\nbecause this is not a vertical supply chain,\n\n21 but there still is a pass-through mechanism.\n\n22 So then the question is, does Illinois Brick\n\n23 apply to that or not?\n\n24 And I think what Justice Breyer was\n\nsuggesting to you, that as long as it\u0027s not\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n14\n\n1 that vertical supply chain where the person is\n\n2 not buying from the monopolist itself, here,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"11","file_name":"Apple Inc. v.

Was it simply a formalistic\n\n11 case about vertical chains, or was it about\n\n12 pass-through?\n\n13 And in answering that question, I\n\n14 would begin with, first of all, with Hanover\n\nShoe, which is about a pass-on defense and\n\n16 about the -- the difficulties in -- in the --\n\n17 the -- the potential complication of antitrust\n\n18 litigation through pass-on defense, and then\n\n19 the framing of the question in Illinois Brick\n\nby this Court which said, having already found\n\n21 that we will not allow a pass-on defense, we\n\n22 are now confronted with the question to whether\n\n23 allow pass-on to be used offensively.\n\n24 It was 100 percent about pass-on. The\n\nvertical chain was the factual setting of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n15\n\nOfficial\n\n1 case, and, indeed, Respondents\u0027 argument would\n\n2 -- would have this Court believe that the\n\n3 factual setting is the sum and substance of the\n\n4 Court\u0027s reasoning.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Wall, could I ask","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"12","file_name":"Apple Inc. v.

These -- you know, the fact\n\n13 of the matter is that nowadays major companies\n\n14 suing their suppliers happens all of the time.\n\nThe idea that it -- that it -- that it\n\n16 doesn\u0027t, which was decried by Judge Posner as\n\n17 fanciful, has proven to be fanciful because it\n\n18 literally happens all of the time.\n\n19 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Well, Mr. Wall,\n\nalong those lines, I -- I take your point that\n\n21 Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe might be read\n\n22 about the economic realities of the\n\n23 pass-through mechanism being important, rather\n\n24 than the contractual formalities, whether it\u0027s\n\na sales agent or a formal purchase between the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n17\n\nOfficial\n\n1 manufacturer and the distributor.\n\n2 And antitrust normally accounts for\n\n3 economics, rather than forms of contract.\n\n4 MR. WALL: Indeed.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: I take your point.\n\n6 But building on what Justice Alito had\n\n7 in mind, Illinois Brick has been questioned by\n\n8 31 states before this Court in an amicus brief.\n\n9 You\u0027re asking us to extend Illinois Brick,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"14","file_name":"Apple Inc. v.
