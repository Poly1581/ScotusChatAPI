So, you know, the\n\nnormal factors the Court takes into account\n\n16 with respect to its precedents, I think, are\n\n17 not barriers here to over -- overruling Austin.\n\n18 And the -- the other thing, I think,\n\n19 you know, you -- you almost can\u0027t get away from\n\nthe prospect of at least implicitly overruling\n\n21 precedent no matter what you do here. If it\u0027s\n\n22 not going to be Austin, then it\u0027s going to be\n\n23 the innocent owner cases, Bennis, Van Oster,\n\n24 all those precedents.\n\nAnd I think it\u0027s instructive here that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n61\n\n1 my friend cites to the dissent in Bennis,\n\n2 acknowledging that, if you\u0027re going to\n\n3 incorporate a grossly disproportionate\n\n4 analysis, then, really, what you\u0027ve got to do\n\nis start getting away from the innocent owner,\n\n6 you know, the lack of a required innocent owner\n\n7 exception, that that\u0027s going to become\n\n8 something that is going to have to be part of\n\n9 that analysis.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"56","file_name":"Timbs v.

Five times\n\n2 over the last 30 years, this Court has remarked\n\n3 that the freedom from excessive economic\n\n4 sanctions should be understood to apply to the\n\nstates.\n\n6 In Hall, in Kennedy, in Roper, in\n\n7 Cooper Industries, and in Booth, all that\n\n8 remains to do is to expressly so hold.\n\n9 My friend\u0027s approach, by contrast, is\n\nradical. He asks the Court to overrule Austin,\n\n11 a unanimous decision that has been on the books\n\n12 for 25 years, that was reaffirmed in Hudson, in\n\n13 Bajakajian, and, again, in Kokesh.\n\n14 And that case looked at the same","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"58","file_name":"Timbs v.

It would allow, if the Court were\n\n17 to overrule Austin, governments at all levels\n\n18 to impose constitutionally excessive civil in\n\n19 rem forfeitures based on nothing more than a\n\nlabel.\n\n21 This is not a labeling game.\n\n22 It would also revive the so-called\n\n23 two-track approach that this Court has rejected\n\n24 now for more than 50 years.\n\nSo even if we imagine that -- that the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n64\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Court would take such a radical approach, it --\n\n2 it would break with, for example, the\n\n3 commercial speech doctrine, which there was a\n\n4 long history of commercial speech activity in\n\nthis country before the 1970s decision in which\n\n6 this Court held that there is a commercial\n\n7 speech right, and did so in a case against the\n\n8 state without even pausing on the incorporation\n\n9 question.\n\nSo, you know, even if some forfeitures\n\n11 are non-punitive, other forfeitures are\n\n12 punitive. And the forfeiture in this case\n\n13 clearly meets Austin\u0027s test that it be at least\n\n14 partly punitive.\n\nIf the Court looks to Indiana Code\n\n16 34-24-1-4(a), it shows that this statute is\n\n17 more punitive than the statute at issue in","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"59","file_name":"Timbs v.
