Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\n11 The Federal Arbitration Act requires\n\n12 courts to enforce arbitration agreements\n\n13 according to their terms.

SHANMUGAM: I think both sides\n\n24 agree that those two things are essentially\n\nreenforcing, which is to say that when you have\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n29\n\nOfficial\n\n1 a party that resists arbitration, the moving\n\n2 party is aggrieved. And I think that\n\n3 Respondent recognizes in a footnote in its\n\n4 brief that \"aggrieved\" does no independent work\n\nbeyond that.\n\n6 But I do think that the regime that\n\n7 we\u0027re advocating is a more efficient regime\n\n8 precisely because, under Respondent\u0027s regime, a\n\n9 district court is supposedly making this\n\nthreshold determination on whether or not the\n\n11 claim of arbitrability is wholly groundless.\n\n12 If a district court concludes that the\n\n13 claim is not wholly groundless, presumably, the\n\n14 issue would then go to the arbitrator to make a\n\nplenary determination on that issue, and if the\n\n16 district court determines that the claim is\n\n17 wholly groundless, there will be appeals as of\n\n18 right immediately under Section 16 of the\n\n19 Arbitration Act.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"26","file_name":"Henry Schein, Inc. v.

In\n\n9 Stolt-Nielsen, the parties expressly agreed\n\nthat the arbitrator would decide if there\u0027s\n\n11 class arbitration.\n\n12 And the court said the arbitrator\n\n13 applied the wrong analysis.

It said there is only one possible\n\n16 outcome and so proceeded to decide the issue on\n\n17 its own.\n\n18 And that\u0027s consistent with general\n\n19 legal principles.

there\u0027s actually a ground to\n\n22 -- to say that injunctive relief goes to the\n\n23 court, but damages go to arbitrators.\n\n24 And when we have mixed claims, most\n\ncourts will either send

MR.\n\nGEYSER: Well, I think -- I think\n\nthere are two ways to look at it, and one is a\n\n11 statutory hook, which I still do think is the\n\n12 best way to read this language. It\u0027s very hard\n\n13 to understand how something is a failure to\n\n14 comply with an arbitration agreement if the\n\narbitration agreement is saying if there\u0027s a\n\n16 bona fide dispute over arbitrability, then it\n\n17 goes to the arbitrator. If there\u0027s not a bona\n\n18 fide dispute over arbitrability, then you don\u0027t\n\n19 fail to comply by filing it in court.\n\nSo it is, in fact, I think the \"wholly\n\n21 groundless\" doctrine that it\u0027s -- it\u0027s tapping\n\n22 on an intuition that\u0027s already there.
