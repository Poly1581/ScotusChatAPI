BRINKMANN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe term \"person\" in this case does\n\nnot extend to include the government for three\n\nreasons. First, the other branches rely on the\n\nDictionary Act definition of person and this\n\nCourt\u0027s presumptive definition of \"person\" to\n\nnot include the government. That is a stable\n\nframework that\u0027s critical to that communication\n\nbetween the branches.\n\nSecond, the estoppel that was enacted\n\nby Congress specifically references the\n\njurisdiction of the district court and the\n\nInternational Trade Commission, not the Court\n\nof Federal Claims, where the government\u0027s\n\npatent litigation takes place, reinforcing the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ndefinition of \"person\" not to include the\n\ngovernment. That was a linchpin to the\n\nstructure that Congress set up. It created a\n\nnew adversarial administrative process, and\n\npart of that balance was to ensure that patent\n\nholders that were subject to that new\n\nadversarial process could then be protected\n\nfrom having to go back and relitigate in court,\n\nin district court or the International Trade\n\nCommission.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your position is\n\nthat it\u0027s -- the estoppel provision is the\n\nlinchpin, you just said, but your position","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Return Mail, Inc. v.

BRINKMANN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS.\n\nBRINKMANN: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nI have four points I\u0027d like to make very\n\nquickly.\n\nThe first one, I just want to clarify\n\nthe thing about trying to short-circuit the\n\nreexam process.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nActually, under 301, there\u0027s a\n\nprovision that says, when a person requests a\n\nreexamination, it can actually be confidential.\n\nSo this idea that somehow there\u0027s going to be a\n\nsecret person asking if the statute already\n\nsays that doesn\u0027t have to be disclosed, I think\n\nthat\u0027s 301(e).\n\nThe second thing I would point about,\n\njust the anomaly of the agency versus agency.\n\nWhatever anyone thinks of that, it would be\n\nextraordinary for Congress to do that through\n\nsilence.\n\nAnd to go to this question about who\n\nwould represent the government, I do know that\n\nin the Civil Division, there, of course, is an\n\noffice that handles the patent litigation. In\n\nfact, that is the office, the appellate\n\ndivision that handles amicus briefs for the PTO\n\nbefore the Federal Circuit, so there is\n\nsignificant interaction.\n\nI mean, I\u0027m not suggesting that no one\n\nwould follow their roles and, you know, the law\n\nand all, but just to answer your question,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"55","file_name":"Return Mail, Inc. v.
