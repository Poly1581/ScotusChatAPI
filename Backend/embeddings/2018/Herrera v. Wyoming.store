HICKS, JR.\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. HICKS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nIn 1868, the Crow Tribe of Indians\n\nagreed to cede to the United States 30 million\n\nacres of its aboriginal land and move to a\n\nreservation. In exchange for ceding its land,\n\nthe tribe expressly reserved the right to hunt\n\non that ceded land.\n\nThe text of the 1868 treaty\n\nmemorializing this agreement explicitly\n\nidentifies the four events that would cause the\n\nhunting right to terminate.

KNEPPER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. KNEPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nMr. Herrera\u0027s claims are identical to\n\nthose presented 25 years ago by his sovereign\n\non his behalf in the case Crow Tribe v.\n\nRepsis.\n\nNothing since Repsis, including the\n\ndecision by this Court in Mille Lacs, merits a\n\n-- an exception to this Court\u0027s repeated\n\ncommand that, once the appeals are over, a\n\nfinal judgment binds the parties and they may\n\nnot renew the same dispute in another forum.\n\nRepsis ruled that this particular\n\ntreaty right had expired, and this Court should\n\nnot on collateral review allow it to spring\n\nback, especially as, when you look at the\n\ndecision in Mille Lacs, Mille Lacs went out of\n\nits way not to overrule the result in Race\n\nHorse.\n\nMuch of -- much of the -- the argument","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"32","file_name":"Herrera v.
