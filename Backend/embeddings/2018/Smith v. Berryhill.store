HUSTON: So, Your Honor, again, I\n\nthink that the reason why \"after a hearing\" is\n\nin 405(g) is because it\u0027s also in 405(h) and\n\nit\u0027s in 405(b)(1). 405(b)(1) is the basic\n\ninstruction to the agency to hold a hearing in\n\norder to make a decision.\n\nAnd so the statute then says, because\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n24\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthe agency typically needs to hold a hearing in\n\norder to make a decision, judicial review is\n\navailable for a final decision after a hearing.\n\nI think it holds together in the ordinary\n\ncourse.\n\nWhat I think Salfi, Eldridge, and City\n\nof New York recognized is that there may be\n\noccasional cases where the agency resolves a\n\nparticular question but doesn\u0027t feel it\u0027s\n\nnecessary to hold a hearing. And in that case,\n\nthere\u0027s at least a strong claim for judicial\n\nreview.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you\n\nnot agreeing with counsel, who told us that\n\n\"after a hearing\" refers only to the ALJ, so we\n\ndon\u0027t have to worry about the appeals court --\n\nthe Appeals Council never holding hearings","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"20","file_name":"Smith v.

And we think it\u0027s also\n\nconsistent with Salfi, which recognized that\n\none critical feature of exhaustion is to enable\n\nthe agency to compile a record that is adequate\n\nfor judicial review.\n\nThat\u0027s exactly what the Appeals\n\nCouncil exists to do. I\u0027d urge the Court to\n\nlook at JA 26, which is Petitioner\u0027s request\n\nfor Appeals Council review.

judicial review not just to any final\n\nagency action but to a particular kind of\n\naction.\n\nEach of the words, a final decision of\n\nthe Commissioner made after a hearing, and\n\nespecially those last four words, needs to be\n\nread together, rather than in isolation,\n\nbecause each word qualifies and modifies the\n\nkind of action in question.\n\nIn SSI cases like this one under Title\n\nXVI of the Social Security Act, Section 405(g)\n\nguarantees judicial review only for disputes\n\nover the eligibility or the amount of welfare\n\nbenefits, the matters on which the Social\n\nSecurity Act itself requires a hearing and a\n\nfinal determination, not on procedures afforded\n\nHeritage Reporting

are \"after a hearing.\"\n\nAnd I think that the parties\u0027\n\ninterpretation comes perilously close to\n\nreading -- either reading the words out of the\n\nstatute or reading them so that there isn\u0027t\n\nreally any plausible relationship between the\n\ndecision and the -- and the \"after a hearing\"\n\nrequirement.\n\nAnd I think, actually, Congress chose\n\nthose words carefully and they meant there to\n\nbe a relationship.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we go

The agency has now\n\ndisassociated itself from this case?\n\nMR. GUPTA: Well, as I said, I don\u0027t\n\nthink those words can be read in isolation,\n\nJustice Ginsburg. And I think even if you set\n\naside \"after a hearing,\" you still have the\n\nwords \"final decision of the Commissioner.\"\n\nAnd I think that does some work here,\n\nbecause one way to think about this is the way\n\nthat cases come to this Court from the state\n\ncourts under 1257.\n\nSo, if you have an intermediate state\n\ncourt decision, the petitioner has to first go\n\nto the state supreme court and find a -- file a\n\ntimely petition.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"29","file_name":"Smith v.

And if all we had was the\n\nword \"final\" here, this would be a very\n\ndifficult assignment for me to discharge. But,\n\nluckily, we have other words in the statute and\n\nthey mean something.\n\nAnd I think Congress chose these words\n\ncarefully, and they -- they chose these words\n\nto address the situation in which they wanted\n\nnot no review, not review of everything, but\n\nreview of the merits, the substance.\n\nAnd then I think it\u0027s -- it\u0027s\n\nimportant that Congress chose this same regime\n\nand expressly incorporated it over and over\n\nagain when it had these massive claims\n\nprocesses, when it wanted to ensure that there\n\nwould be judicial review of the merits but not\n\njudicial review of every fact mound or\n\ndiscretionary dispute about compliance with the\n\nagency\u0027s internal processes, because the\n\njudiciary does not add a whole lot of\n\ninstitutional competence to this very friendly,\n\nclaimant-friendly process, when those kinds of\n\ncases are being channeled into federal court.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"47","file_name":"Smith v.
