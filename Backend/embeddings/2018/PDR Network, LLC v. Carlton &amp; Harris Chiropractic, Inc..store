PHILLIPS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe most startling comment in the\n\nFourth Circuit\u0027s opinion in this case is the\n\nfollowing one: \"We need not harmonize the\n\nFCC\u0027s rule with the underlying statute.\"\n\nI would have thought, in any ordinary\n\ninstance of judicial review of administrative\n\nagency decision-making, that\u0027s a statement that\n\nought to leap out off the page, and when it\u0027s\n\nbeing applied in the context of a private right\n\nof action brought as a class action by private\n\nplaintiffs against a private defendant who is\n\nseeking to assert that the statute is not\n\nviolated by the action of the defendant, the\n\nidea that the court of appeals will say, no,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nno, there\u0027s no opportunity and no reason for\n\nthe courts to entertain the agency\u0027s standard\n\nto be applied in those circumstances is one\n\nthat, it would seem to me, you could only\n\njustify in extraordinary circumstances that are\n\ncandidly not presented.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"PDR Network, LLC v.
