The Court has had a series of\n\nquestions about kind of some of the\n\n11 practicalities.\n\nI\u0027d like to address first\n\n12 Justice Kavanaugh\u0027s question about the pot.\n\n13 There\u0027s actually two statutory\n\n14 provisions. The first is at (a)(4). (a)(4) is\n\nat page 7a of our brief. That says that the\n\n16 Secretary shall certify for payment out of\n\n17 past-due benefits so much of the maximum fee as\n\n18 does not exceed 25 percent. The maximum fee,\n\n19 if you look throughout the prior provisions of\n\n(a), talk about the maximum fee that the\n\n21 commissioner approves for work before the\n\n22 agency.\n\n23 So that (a)(4) provision mandates that\n\n24 so much of that maximum fee, that is, the\n\nagency fee, as does not exceed 25 percent shall\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n18\n\nOfficial\n\n1 be paid. It\u0027s mandatory.\n\n2 Now I think there\u0027s two things. First\n\n3 is the mandatory. The pot must be 25 percent,\n\n4 at least, if the agency fee is that large.\n\nAnd, two, the language \"so much of the\n\n6 agency fee as does not exceed\" emphasizes that\n\n7 Congress understood that the agency fee could\n\n8 and would sometimes exceed 25 percent of\n\n9 past-due benefits, which itself is incompatible\n\nwith an aggregate 25 percent.\n\n11 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: A different","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"16","file_name":"Culbertson v.
