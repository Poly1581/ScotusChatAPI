But Petitioner, on page 8 of his\n\n21 reply brief, isn\u0027t even willing to say whether\n\n22 those offenses qualify.\n\n23 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But, if they did\n\n24 qualify, then how many states are affected?\n\nMR.

purse snatching or pickpocketing -- those\n\n13 things were the very reason -- was the very\n\n14 reason for Robinson.\n\nRobinson, the Florida Supreme Court\n\n16 case, the very reason for it was to
