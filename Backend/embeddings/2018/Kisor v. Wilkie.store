HUGHES: Your Honor, I think it\u0027s\n\njust impossible to reconcile Auer deference\n\nwith the judgment that\u0027s reflected in the APA,\n\nthat when an agency is going to put on its\n\npolicy-making hat, which undoubtedly the agency\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncan do, there\u0027s an ability for the public to be\n\nable to participate in that process and provide\n\ntheir views.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: You\u0027re right, you\u0027re\n\nright that it says in the APA, it says, you\u0027re\n\nabsolutely right, that when a judge decides a\n\ncase, and it has to do with the meaning of the\n\nregulation, it says the judge, the reviewing\n\ncourt shall determine the meaning or\n\napplicability of the terms of an agency action.\n\nThat\u0027s what you\u0027re relying on. And\n\nthere\u0027s just one thing missing, one thing\n\nmissing, and that is it doesn\u0027t say how you do\n\nit.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"18","file_name":"Kisor v.
