BORGHESAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\n11 This case shows why retaliatory arrest\n\n12 claims should be governed by the well-grounded\n\n13 common-law rule that the existence of pro --\n\n14 probable cause would protect against liability\n\nfor enforcing the criminal law.\n\n16 First, these -- the determining\n\n17 causation in these claims is especially\n\n18 difficult for the reasons the Court recognized\n\n19 in Lozman. And, second, the law\u0027s tools for\n\nfiltering out speculative claims and giving\n\n21 officers a margin forever -- for error don\u0027t\n\n22 work well in these cases.\n\n23 And the Court doesn\u0027t want a rule\n\n24 where an officer can be haled into court on any\n\nroutine arrest and forced to defend the purity\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n4\n\n1 of his motives, however reasonable his actions.\n\n2 Nor should the Court want a rule that gives\n\n3 officers a reason to hesitate in situations\n\n4 where they should be able to act decisively.\n\nI want to start with the point about\n\n6 complexity because I believe this case has all\n\n7 the elements the Court identified in Lozman.\n\n8 One, speech can be a valid consideration for\n\n9 the officers in deciding whether to effectuate\n\nan arrest.\n\n11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why doesn\u0027t","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Nieves v.

On the probable\n\n14 cause, probable cause for the charged offenses\n\nor probable cause for some offense that wasn\u0027t\n\n16 charged?\n\n17 MR. BORGHESAN: I think, in that\n\n18 respect, the Court\u0027s rule should recognize that\n\n19 police officers arrest based on the course of\n\nconduct and they aren\u0027t legal technicians.\n\n21 So I think that, at a minimum, the\n\n22 Court\u0027s rule should -- the probable cause\n\n23 element should apply for the stated crime of\n\n24 arrest or the crimes charged or crimes closely\n\nrelated to those crimes.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"11","file_name":"Nieves v.

I don\u0027t think this case\n\n4 presents that question.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think of\n\n6 efforts to reach a compromise between the two\n\n7 cases that Justice Alito raised? See, we saw\n\n8 in Lozman a case where, I think in the\n\n9 courtroom, someone said, well, surely there\u0027s\n\nsome statute he violated.\n\n11 Now that doesn\u0027t sound like a good\n\n12 case for your side. So, among other things\n\n13 I\u0027ve written down, we have, one, Mt. Healthy,\n\n14 plaintiff, he engaged in protected expression.\n\nThat won\u0027t be too hard to show.\n\n16 The defendant harbored retaliatory\n\n17 animus. In a lot of these cases, he did, for\n\n18 political or racial maybe or other reasons.\n\n19 Three, animus was a substantial factor\n\nmotivating the decision. That\u0027s a little\n\n21 tougher to show where there\u0027s probable cause.\n\n22 And then, even in the absence of the probable\n\n23 cause, even in the absence of protected\n\n24 conduct, he would have reached the same\n\ndecision.

First, every similar\n\n12 constitutional tort claim under 1983 has an\n\n13 objective requirement that prevents a purely\n\n14 subjective inquiry into officers\u0027 motivations.\n\nIf anything, it is more important that\n\n16 claims of retaliatory arrest be subject to such\n\n17 a screen because, as the bipartisan states\u0027\n\n18 brief from D.C. points out, they\u0027re easy to\n\n19 allege and difficult and expensive to defend\n\nagainst.\n\n21 Second, of the --\n\n22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Wall, I\n\n23 mean, in the Fourth Amendment context, for\n\n24 example, the fact that there\u0027s a probable cause\n\nrequirement is a function of the substance of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n22\n\n1 the Fourth Amendment. What\u0027s unusual about\n\n2 this case is that you\u0027re asking for a probable\n\n3 cause requirement that bears no relationship to\n\n4 the actual First Amendment violation.\n\nIn other words, it makes no difference\n\n6 to the First Amendment that there might have\n\n7 been probable cause for an arrest if, in fact,\n\n8 the arrest occurred as a result of retaliation\n\n9 for protected speech.\n\nMR.

WALL: Yes.\n\n24 JUSTICE KAGAN: And what was the\n\n\"but\"?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n30\n\n1 MR. WALL: I think the \"but\" is that\n\n2 if the Court wants to draw limits on these to\n\n3 try to get at cases where the officers or the\n\n4 prosecutors are just kind of inventing probable\n\ncause after the fact to paper over an arrest\n\n6 that was problematic, you could limit the\n\n7 probable cause inquiry to the -- some\n\n8 reasonable time frame after the arrest.\n\n9 Now I don\u0027t think you can do just the\n\narrest because, you know, you get back to the\n\n11 station house, you consult with the\n\n12 prosecutors, and it turns out the statute\u0027s\n\n13 different than the statute you thought, so it\u0027s\n\n14 not waving the weapon, it\u0027s reckless\n\nendangerment, but everybody knows it\u0027s the same\n\n16 course of conduct.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"27","file_name":"Nieves v.
