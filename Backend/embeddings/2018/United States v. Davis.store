I think there are a couple of\n\nissues with that language as well.\n\nFirst of all, I wouldn\u0027t put any\n\nweight on the change in tenses because, of\n\ncourse, Section 924(c), like other crimes that\n\nare defined in Title 18, speaks in the present\n\ntense. It talks about a defendant who uses or\n\ncarries a firearm. And the switch to the past\n\ntense is something kind of odd.\n\nAgain, this is the language Congress\n\nconstructed because it\u0027s worried about this\n\nCourt potentially construing the language in a\n\nmanner that would render it constitutionally\n\ninvalid. So it\u0027s -- I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a fair\n\nrepresentation of what Congress might have\n\nthought in -- in 1986.\n\nAlso, with reference to the term \"by\n\nits nature,\" I do think the term \"by its\n\nnature\" can be used and was used in Section\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n20\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"17","file_name":"United States v.

First, they contain the\n\nsame language that gives rise to an ordinary\n\ncase categorical approach.\n\nSecond, they share a common history,\n\nsuggesting similar treatment under the law.\n\nAnd, third, a conduct-based approach\n\nlies beyond the reach of constitutional\n\navoidance.\n\nBefore I move to my first --\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Those cases --\n\nthose cases were concerned about the jury,\n\nprotecting the right of the jury to find the\n\nfacts.

But, if we look to how Congress\n\nwas thinking about these things when it passed\n\nthe Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984,\n\nwhich created the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n\nSection 16, as well as the first definition of\n\n\"crime of violence\" here, Congress was thinking\n\nabout the predicate offenses categorically, as\n\ncategories of traditionally violent crimes.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, on the question\n\nof what Congress was thinking, maybe we could\n\njust take a -- a glimpse at what actually\n\nhappened in this case, which is that the\n\ndefendant conspired to commit and then\n\ncommitted a series of robberies of convenience\n\nstores, where they put a sawed-off shotgun to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthe head of a clerk and then robbed cigarettes.\n\nNow you really think Congress would\n\nsay, well, that\u0027s not really a crime of\n\nviolence?\n\nMR. BECK: The defendants in this case\n\nare guilty of every offense you just described,\n\nand we\u0027re not challenging any of those\n\nconvictions.\n\nThe difference here today, if we were\n\nto win and remove one of the six counts that\n\nthey were convicted under, is that either they\n\nwould die in prison or be released as very old\n\nmen.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"44","file_name":"United States v.

FEIGIN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nI just have, I think, four points.\n\nOne is I think my friend agreed in a number of\n\npoints that our burden is simply to show that\n\nthis is a plausible interpretation of the\n\nstatute.\n\nSecond, I think it\u0027s helpful in that\n\nrespect to think about whether this particular\n\nself-contained provision, if it were to have\n\ncome before the Court as the first time anyone\n\nwas ever urging a categorical approach, and a\n\ncriminal defendant were coming before this\n\nCourt and saying, no, you should apply the rule\n\nof lenity for me because I want a\n\ncircumstance-specific approach.\n\nI understand that an ordinary\n\ndefendant who commits commercial sex\n\ntrafficking with a minor does so by threatening\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n64\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"57","file_name":"United States v.
