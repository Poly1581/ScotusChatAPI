the Court would do --\n\n9 now I want to bring up the roads provision\n\nbecause Mr. Cooper mentioned them.\n\n11 They say there\u0027s this one provision of\n\n12 the law at issue in Skull Valley that turns a\n\n13 county road into a state road.\n\n14 Well, I\u0027D say two things about that\n\nprovision. First, if that\u0027s literally all that\n\n16 Utah did, all Utah did was to convert a road\n\n17 from a county road to a state road, and that\u0027s\n\n18 the only thing they did, there would be no\n\n19 basis whatsoever for finding that law standing\n\nalone was preempted by the Atomic Energy Act.\n\n21 And to the extent that it operated --\n\n22 I think there was also discussion of the\n\n23 National Meats case, which I think is\n\n24 affirmatively helpful for us because, at the\n\nend of the opinion in National Meat, the Court\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n54\n\nOfficial\n\n1 got to the sales provision of the California\n\n2 law and the Court said: You know, this doesn\u0027t\n\n3 directly act upon the conduct that\u0027s regulated\n\n4 by federal law. And so I guess you could make\n\nan argument, the Humane Society made the\n\n6 argument, that\u0027s not preempted.\n\n7 And here\u0027s what the Court actually\n\n8 said in National Meat. That argument ignores\n\n9 the way that the sales provision operates\n\nwithin state law as a whole.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"48","file_name":"Virginia Uranium, Inc. v.

HEYTENS: Yes.\n\n23 JUSTICE KAGAN: And I suppose one way\n\n24 to understand this -- the preemptive field here\n\nis that it surely extends to various kinds of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n59\n\nOfficial\n\n1 activities, and this is not one of those\n\n2 activities, the mining.\n\n3 But, in addition, it extends to\n\n4 judgments about radiological safety, even\n\noutside those activities, on the theory that\n\n6 the NRC is the proper body to make judgments\n\n7 about radiological safety and we don\u0027t want 50\n\n8 states to be making their own.\n\n9 So I suppose that\u0027s a -- a way to\n\nexplain the opposite position.\n\n11 MR. HEYTENS: I agree with that,\n\n12 Justice Kagan, but I think the very last thing\n\n13 you said shows why that argument can\u0027t possibly\n\n14 be right.\n\nNRC lacks the authority to regulate\n\n16 even the radiological safety aspects of mining.\n\n17 So the logical -- if you define the field that\n\n18 way, the logical implication of that argument\n\n19 is that there is literally no one who has the\n\nauthority to regulate radiological safety\n\n21 aspects of uranium mining, because the NRC\n\n22 can\u0027t do it, because the NRC has repeatedly\n\n23 reaffirmed that they have no power to do\n\n24 anything.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Aren\u0027t the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"53","file_name":"Virginia Uranium, Inc. v.

But there\u0027s the separate\n\n6 question of whether the process of digging it\n\n7 out of the ground raises any radiological\n\n8 safety concerns.\n\n9 And I think there\u0027s at least some\n\nevidence in some of the briefing that there may\n\n11 be at least some radiological safety concerns\n\n12 associated with doing that. Without saying\n\n13 they\u0027re the same as milling.\n\n14 And there -- regardless of whether\n\nthere are radiological safety concerns, there\n\n16 are clearly a wide variety of health and safety\n\n17 concerns associated with extracting massive\n\n18 amounts of material out of the ground.\n\n19 And so we think that, at the end of\n\nthe day, the purpose -- this Court has\n\n21 reaffirmed repeatedly that the purpose of a\n\n22 statute includes not only what it sets out to\n\n23 change but also what it resolves to leave\n\n24 alone.\n\nAnd we think the single clearest and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n63\n\nOfficial\n\n1 completely dispositive decision by Congress in\n\n2 this case was the decision it made in 1946 that\n\n3 it reaffirmed in 1954 and has left undisturbed\n\n4 until the present day, that the federal\n\ngovernment does not regulate uranium mining.\n\n6 For that reason, Virginia\u0027s inherent","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"56","file_name":"Virginia Uranium, Inc. v.
