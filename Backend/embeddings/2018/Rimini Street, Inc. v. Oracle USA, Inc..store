PERRY\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe term \"costs\" is a term of art in\n\nfederal law. This Court has held as much three\n\ntimes: in Crawford Fitting, in Casey, and in\n\nMurphy.\n\nIt is defined in Section 1920 of Title\n\n28, and the Court also has held that three\n\ntimes in those three same cases.\n\nIn the Taniguchi case, the Court\u0027s\n\nmost recent decision in this line, the Court\n\nemphasized that \"costs\" in federal law does not\n\nhave its ordinary meaning but, rather, has this\n\nspecialized meaning.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what\n\nabout full costs?

That formula helps courts and\n\nlitigants navigate more than 200 statutes that\n\nuse the term.

1920 presumptively applies\n\nin all civil cases, regardless of when those\n\nprovisions were adopted.\n\nGoing back to the original history,\n\nwhat is it that the term \"full costs\" was\n\nenacted in order to do? We think that it does\n\na couple things.\n\nFive days after setting up the federal\n\njudiciary, Congress enacted the Process Act,\n\ntelling federal courts to look to state fee\n\nbills in order to determine which costs could\n\nbe shifted between litigants. That was the\n\nregime that prevailed at the time that this\n\nprovision was added to the Copyright Act in\n\n1831.\n\nThere were two general types of state\n\nfee bill provisions that would have made the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nword \"full\" in full costs necessary, and we\n\ngive a couple examples on page 17 of our brief,\n\nFootnote 1.\n\nThe first type of case are statutes\n\nthat impose some sort of limitation on costs.\n\nSo an example would be the first statute, a\n\nKentucky statute providing \"the plaintiff shall\n\nrecover his full costs although the damages do\n\nnot exceed 40 shillings.\" There were a number\n\nof statutes that said, if your damages were not\n\nabove a certain threshold, you would get no\n\nmore cost than damages. Forty shillings was a\n\ntypical amount.\n\nSo this provision tells you that, even\n\nif your damages are below that type of\n\nthreshold, nevertheless, you get your full\n\ncosts.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"19","file_name":"Rimini Street, Inc. v.

As far as we\u0027re\n\naware, there is no fee bill from the\n\n19th Century that awarded expert witness fees.\n\nThe other thing that you would see is\n\nthat they\u0027re comprehensive.

In Casey, this Court said\n\nyou can\u0027t get your expert fees in certain civil\n\nrights cases. And so Congress passed a statute\n\nadding expert fees to the list of compensable\n\nexpenses under Section 1988, which governs\n\nthose civil -- same civil rights cases.\n\nThe benefit of the Crawford Fitting\n\nformula is that it provides clear instructions\n\nto Congress to tell them if you want to include\n\nsomething that\u0027s not already listed in\n\nSection 1920, here\u0027s how you do it. And as my\n\nfriend pointed out, it propagates all the way\n\nthrough if you amend Section 1920 itself, or\n\nyou can create a specific provision.\n\nNow you might think all of this\n\nhistory is a bit of a muddle. Another benefit\n\nof the Crawford Fitting rule is that you don\u0027t\n\nhave to perform a historical exegesis every\n\ntime you come across a new provision with\n\nslightly different language.

recently than\n\nthis one which mention full costs, and you\n\nasked: Why did they do that?\n\nSo, first of all, let\u0027s just say --\n\nput the point that all of them deal with\n\nintellectual property in some fashion, so\n\nchances are they were just copied from\n\nSection 505.\n\nBut they all also specifically mention\n\nattorneys\u0027 fees, which is a big problem on\n\nRespondents\u0027 side because, if full costs\n\nalready meant total compensation, there would\n\nhave been no point in expressly adding\n\nattorneys\u0027 fees.\n\nNow Respondents\u0027 response to that is,\n\nwell, in 1909, when the American rule wasn\u0027t\n\nwell established, it was necessary to clarify\n\nthat attorneys\u0027 fees were included in full\n\ncosts. That doesn\u0027t work even in 1909 because\n\nthe copyright statute as it was enacted then\n\nmade full costs mandatory but attorneys\u0027 fees\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n29\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ndiscretionary.\n\nSo, clearly, Congress wasn\u0027t just\n\nclarifying that the latter was included in the\n\nformer.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"25","file_name":"Rimini Street, Inc. v.

Subject to Final Review\n\njust a subset of the ordinary meaning of costs\n\nactually helps reinforce the idea that full\n\ncosts means something more than the subset.\n\nI mean, I think if you think of a word\n\nlike full membership, well, full membership\n\nprobably means full membership, but if it\u0027s\n\nused in contradistinction to observer status or\n\nprovisional membership, you absolutely know you\n\nmean the whole thing.\n\nIn the same way, the reference to\n\n\"full cost,\" precisely because there is a\n\nuniverse of taxable costs out there, is a\n\nreference to both taxable and non-taxable\n\ncosts.\n\nI mean, another way of thinking about\n\nthis is we all refer to 1920 as taxable costs,\n\nbut we could equally and accurately refer to it\n\nas partial costs. Nobody thinks, as a normal\n\nmatter, a default matter under 1920 you get\n\nyour full costs.\n\nBut, when Congress in its particular\n\ncontext and then in four subsequent statutes\n\nsays \"full costs,\" you think, ahh, you get more\n\nthan your partial costs under Section 1920.\n\nSeems like a logical way to interpret the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nstatute that renders no word in the statute\n\nsuperfluous.\n\nAnd I do think the superfluity problem","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"52","file_name":"Rimini Street, Inc. v.
