So we know that they weren\u0027t\n\nthe basis for the line that the state drew and\n\nthey\u0027re not even-handedly applied.\n\nMoreover, many of those arguments were\n\nraised in the circuit court, and the circuit\n\ncourt rejected them and said Davis precludes\n\nthem because they\u0027re just ultimately an\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n72\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nargument about the amount of compensation.\n\nAnd if the state were going to draw\n\nthe line based on that, it would have drawn the\n\nline neutrally based on the line of\n\ncompensation, not done it the way it did, which\n\nwas to discriminate based on source.\n\nSo none of these are legally relevant,\n\nand, therefore, a remand is not appropriate.\n\nThird, the burden on the State here is\n\nrather light. Under Davis, all we\u0027re asking\n\nfor is for the states to draw facially-neutral\n\nlines, and that is not a difficult burden.\n\nThere are no state amici in this case\n\nsupporting West Virginia, and that suggests","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"63","file_name":"Dawson v.
