DAVID BREEMER\n\n9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. BREEMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\n11 may it please the Court:\n\n12 Requiring Ms. Knick to prosecute her\n\n13 federal takings claim in state court conflicts\n\n14 with Section 1983 and is incompatible with the\n\nnature of her claim. Her claim is not based on\n\n16 the government\u0027s failure to compensate. It\u0027s\n\n17 based on the township\u0027s failure to recognize\n\n18 that the imposition of an access easement is a\n\n19 Fifth Amendment taking that triggers a\n\ncompensation requirement.\n\n21 Because lack of compensation is not an\n\n22 element of her federal takings claim, state\n\n23 compensation remedies do not bear on the\n\n24 presentation of the claim in federal court.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is it not\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n4\n\n1 an element of her claim?

BREEMER: Well, Your Honor, in the\n\n4 inverse condemnation context, the problem is\n\nnot that the government\u0027s violating the Just\n\n6 Compensation Clause by failing to pay. The\n\n7 problem is that it\u0027s depriving her of her right\n\n8 to just compensation because it does not\n\n9 recognize that its invasion of her property is\n\na taking that triggers the entitlement to\n\n11 compensation.\n\n12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"2","file_name":"Knick v.

The government doesn\u0027t violate the\n\ntakings clause if it provides just compensation\n\n16 after the fact. But it erred in assuming that\n\n17 Section 1983 is only available to address\n\n18 constitutional violations. Instead, it\u0027s\n\n19 available to enforce the deprivation of all\n\nconstitutional rights, and there\u0027s no basis for\n\n21 concluding that the right to just compensation\n\n22 is the only right that Section 1983 doesn\u0027t\n\n23 cover.\n\n24 But, second, I think you can\n\neffectively reach the same result under Section\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n23\n\n1 1331 because, as this Court held in\n\n2 International College of Surgeons, is -- if a\n\n3 state cause of action asserts a federal takings\n\n4 claim as such, then that state cause of action\n\narises under the Constitution for purposes of\n\n6 Section 1331, and so the property owner falls\n\n7 within the district court\u0027s original\n\n8 jurisdiction, and you don\u0027t have to address\n\n9 whether Williamson County was rightly or\n\nwrongly decided --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"20","file_name":"Knick v.
