And I think\n\nit\u0027s crucial, Justice Sotomayor, because while\n\nthere\u0027s the importance of one state not\n\nregulating another, there\u0027s also the crucial\n\ninterest that a state has in protecting its\n\ncitizens when they\u0027re injured, including by\n\nanother state. This Court has long recognized\n\nthat as a vital interest of the states.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"26","file_name":"Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v.

Actually,\n\nif you look at Footnote 29 in Nevada versus\n\nHall, it does cite to a case, State of Georgia\n\nversus City of Chattanooga. It says that, if a\n\nstate owns property in another state, it\u0027s\n\nsubject to eminent domain and judicial\n\nproceedings in that state, like any other owner\n\nof property.\n\nI think the key is there weren\u0027t many\n\ncases either before Nevada versus Hall, and\n\nthere aren\u0027t many cases since Nevada versus\n\nHall. That\u0027s because this isn\u0027t something that\n\narises very frequently.

CHEMERINSKY: Well, I\u0027d go back to\n\nthis Court\u0027s decision in the Hilton versus\n\nSouth Carolina case, and this Court there said\n\nadherence to precedent promotes stability,\n\npredictability, and respect for judicial\n\nauthority.\n\nAnd this was a case about overturning\n\nprecedent in the area of constitutional law.\n\nThis is about stability of law. For 40 years,\n\nthis has been the law. It\u0027s about\n\npredictability. People have relied upon this\n\nin filing the suits.\n\nBut it\u0027s also about respect for\n\njudicial authority.
