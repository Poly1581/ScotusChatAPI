something.\n\nIt\u0027s not just rule or regulation; it\u0027s\n\nstatement of policy. And it seems to suggest\n\nto me that there\u0027s some interpretive rules that\n\nare encompassed by that. Now which ones is the\n\nopen question.\n\nBut it does seem to suggest that it\u0027s\n\nbroader than the APA ever was, because the APA\n\nonly talks about rules.\n\nMR.

The fact is\n\nthe contractors are the ones who make the final\n\npayment determination. How this regime works\n\nis the hospitals submit a cost report form that\n\nhas all the data on it. The contractors then\n\nuse the fractions from the agency, and they\n\nthen compute the final adjustment that the\n\nhospital is owed.\n\nThat is then a final binding payment\n\ndetermination. That\u0027s it. That\u0027s how much the\n\nhospital is owed, unless the hospitals could do\n\nan administrative appeal or they can sue in\n\ncourt.\n\nIf you don\u0027t do the administrative\n\nappeal or sue in court, there\u0027s no doubt about\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nit, it\u0027s in the reg, that is your final\n\ndetermination of your legal right to payment.\n\nNow, here --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But doesn\u0027t it\n\nmake sense if you\u0027ve got -- I don\u0027t know\n\nexactly -- I mean, how many of these interim\n\ncalculations do they have?\n\nMR.
