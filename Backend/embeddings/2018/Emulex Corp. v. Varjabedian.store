The cert\n\npetition didn\u0027t raise any question about\n\nwhether there was an underlying implied private\n\nright for aiding and abetting. This Court\n\nitself raised and added that question.

It\u0027s not a\n\ncase like Cannon, where there actually was\n\nlanguage directed to the victims. In that\n\ncase, the statute was no person shall be\n\ndiscriminated against on the basis of sex.\n\nAnd that statute had been then\n\ninterpreted to have a private right of action.\n\nIt made more sense to say that that meaning was\n\nencompassed in those victim-focused words.\n\nAnd then the third point is that this\n\ntype of provision that involves\n\nmisrepresentations and omissions of material\n\nfact appears, as I mentioned, at a number of\n\nplaces, and we know it often does not create a\n\nprivate right of action.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t create a private right of\n\naction in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"31","file_name":"Emulex Corp. v.

If\n\nthere are some that the Commission sees, then\n\nit\u0027s good to hear those.\n\nMS. RATNER: So, first, we think the\n\nmost obvious real-world problem is the\n\nexistence of a private right of action has led\n\nlower courts to create the scienter standard,\n\nwhich we don\u0027t think is the proper scope of the\n\nCommission\u0027s enforcement authority.\n\nAnd I would just flag that, as a\n\ngeneral matter in the private rights context,\n\nit is a pretty common situation in Central\n\nBank, in Sandoval, in Transamerica, that the\n\nlower courts are uniform in finding a private\n\nright of action that this Court then says\n\ndoesn\u0027t exist because they\u0027ve been following\n\ntheir earlier precedent.\n\nSo I -- I -- I do recognize, given, I\n\nbelieve, Justice Ginsburg\u0027s question earlier\n\nthat this does create an anomaly between 14(a)\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"35","file_name":"Emulex Corp. v.

This Court in Sandoval\n\nchartered a completely different course than\n\nthe Court had previously taken, and there\u0027s\n\nabsolutely no reason for this Court to abandon\n\nor backtrack in any way on that course.\n\nI\u0027ve heard no answer from my friend\n\ntoday as to how Section 14(e) actually\n\nsatisfies the test set forth in Sandoval for\n\ncreating implied private rights.\n\nInstead, all we\u0027ve heard is arguments\n\nfor eroding Sandoval based on context, time\n\ntravel, congressional silence. There\u0027s no\n\nreason for this Court to cut back on Sandoval\n\nand create new exceptions that are going to\n\nlead to grandfathering private rights","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"67","file_name":"Emulex Corp. v.
