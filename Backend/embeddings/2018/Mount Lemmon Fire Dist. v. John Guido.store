My friend\n\n12 says that we do not dispute that \"also means,\"\n\n13 the key statutory phrase here, can mean\n\n14 different things. But the truth is we actually\n\ndo dispute that.\n\n16 The meaning of \"also means\" is\n\n17 additive. It adds something that wasn\u0027t there\n\n18 before. And the -- the confirmation of that is\n\n19 found throughout the U.S. Code. In our brief,\n\nwe cite the 32 other instances in the U.S. Code\n\n21 where the phrase \"also means\" appears in a\n\n22 definitional statute. All 32 of those phrases\n\n23 -- of statutes use it in an additive manner.\n\n24 And I think perhaps the most telling one --\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One doesn\u0027t.

MR.\n\nFISHER: I think that\u0027s not\n\n3 exactly the way Congress would have thought of\n\n4 it.\n\nIn the legislative history, you find\n\nelements -- and I am going to answer your\n\n6 question directly, I think -- you find in Title\n\n7 VII that Congress was concerned with\n\n8 associational interests, personal associations.\n\n9 So one of the things behind the\n\nnumerosity requirement in Title VII is a\n\n11 concern about forcing very, very small groups\n\n12 of people to associate with individuals they\n\n13 might not like.

And I\u0027d add, Justice Kagan, you asked\n\nme just about federal, but as we cite in our\n\n11 brief in a lengthy footnote, there are many,\n\n12 many states, the majority of states, in fact,\n\n13 that cover political subdivisions regardless of\n\n14 size. Of that group, about half of them cover\n\npolitical subdivisions regardless of size and,\n\n16 on the other hand, still have a numerosity\n\n17 requirement for private employers.\n\n18 Now take that one step --\n\n19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How are -- how are\n\nthose state statutes raised in comparison to\n\n21 this statute?\n\n22 MR. FISHER: I didn\u0027t hear the\n\n23 beginning, Justice Ginsburg.\n\n24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The state statutes,\n\nyou -- you say that most states include\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n36\n\n1 political subdivisions without regard to size.\n\n2 And do we have language in what -- the\n\n3 language that most states use? Is it similar\n\n4 to the language that\u0027s used in -- in the ADEA\n\nor --\n\n6 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\n\n7 these citations are all collected in Footnote 6\n\n8 on page 29 of our brief. And the answer to\n\n9 your question is, by and large, the state\n\nstatutes actually use different language. So\n\n11 it\u0027s not a case where the states are merely\n\n12 parroting what the ADEA already says.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"32","file_name":"Mount Lemmon Fire Dist. v.

the two statutes were\n\nidentical in the sense that when you look to\n\n16 the definitional provisions of the Act, you\n\n17 found first a definition of the word \"person\"\n\n18 and then you found a definition of the word\n\n19 \"employer.\"\n\nAnd so what did Congress do in Title\n\n21 VII? It amended the -- it amended the\n\n22 definition of \"person\" to achieve, as Justice\n\n23 Ginsburg pointed out, a very easy solution\n\n24 where the numerosity requirement applied to\n\npolitical subdivisions.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n38\n\n1 When it amended the ADEA, in the exact\n\n2 same Act that it amended the FLSA, indisputably\n\n3 to cover political subdivisions regardless of\n\n4 size, it did the same thing it did in the FLSA,\n\nwhich is amend the definition of \"employer\" and\n\n6 not the definition of \"person.\"\n\n7 And I\u0027d point this Court to its own\n\n8 decisions in cases like Gross and Nassar which\n\n9 say that we look to not just the language\n\nchoices Congress made and assume it\u0027s\n\n11 intentional. We also look to structural\n\n12 choices that Congress makes and we assume those\n\n13 are intentional.\n\n14 And so, even if I had nothing but the\n\ncomparison between the ADEA and Title VII,\n\n16 under those cases, I think that would be enough\n\n17 to remove any doubt that the Court might have\n\n18 about what Congress was trying to achieve here.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"34","file_name":"Mount Lemmon Fire Dist. v.

FISHER: Justice Alito, let me\n\nanswer that question, if I may, in two steps.\n\n11 I want to first start with my point of\n\n12 agreement with the other side, which is we\n\n13 agree that the key question is whether \"also\n\n14 means\" adds something even with respect to the\n\nagent clause. We think that\u0027s an important\n\n16 question for the Court to ask.\n\n17 But this brings me back to Justice\n\n18 Breyer\u0027s question, which is I don\u0027t think there\n\n19 can be any reasonable dispute that the \"agent\"\n\nclause does add additional entities into the\n\n21 category of employer, and it\u0027s not just the\n\n22 below 20 thing.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"35","file_name":"Mount Lemmon Fire Dist. v.

A few just brief points:\n\nFirst, Mr. Fisher\u0027s explanation of\n\n21 \"agency\" is at war with Burlington. This Court\n\n22 said that the reason that there is respondeat\n\n23 superior in Title VII is because of the \"agent\"\n\n24 clause. Nothing else created that.\n\nThe difference between Title VII and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \n(202) 628-4888\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n56\n\n1 Title IX here is crucial. Gebser said Title IX\n\n2 has no respondeat superior liability. Why?\n\n3 Because it did not have an \"agent\" clause.\n\n4 Now I\u0027m not saying that there is no\n\nliability for that third-party agent. Of\n\n6 course, there\u0027s liability. The \"agent\" clause\n\n7 here doesn\u0027t just implement respondeat\n\n8 superior; it implements agency principles as to\n\n9 both employees and the -- the independent\n\nagent.\n\n11 That doesn\u0027t mean that agents\n\n12 themselves have to have 20 employees. That\u0027s\n\n13 clear from the wording -- the wording of the\n\n14 statute. So you start with (b), it says, \"The\n\nemployer is anyone who has 20\" -- \"is a person","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"50","file_name":"Mount Lemmon Fire Dist. v.

it is unfathomable\n\n16 that Congress would have singled out public\n\n17 entities for harsh treatment in a statute whose\n\n18 whole purpose was to bring public employees\n\n19 into the ambit that private employees occupied.\n\nSecond, Respondents rewrite the\n\n21 statute so that \"agent\" means independent\n\n22 third-party contractor and they say employees\n\n23 are not agents. You cannot just wave around --\n\n24 wave away the problems that are created by that\n\nreading. It is not peripheral.

But, at a minimum,\n\npublic employees under Respondents\u0027 reading\n\n11 lose all recourse for the acts of third-party\n\n12 contractors. That is at least clear.\n\n13 So, since there\u0027s a reasonable reading\n\n14 of the statute that achieves Congress\u0027s stated\n\ngoal without creating any of this mischief,\n\n16 that is the reading that this Court should\n\n17 adopt.\n\n18 If there are no further questions, we\n\n19 respectfully request that the Court reverse.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\n21 counsel.\n\n22 The case is submitted.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2018","index":"52","file_name":"Mount Lemmon Fire Dist. v.
