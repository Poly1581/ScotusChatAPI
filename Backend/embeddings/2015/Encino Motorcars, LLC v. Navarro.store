CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 Service advisors are salespeople principally\n\n11 engaged in the servicing of automobiles.

And so\n\n5 they don\u0027t qualify ­­\n\n6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the answer would be\n\n7 because the partsmen and mechanics, so Congress thought,\n\n8 in agricultural areas, would have to go at 3:00 in the\n\n9 morning to fix the tractor, and that\u0027s why they get\n\n10 within this special treatment. And ­­ and whether\n\n11 that\u0027s still true or not, I don\u0027t know. But that\u0027s why\n\n12 they\u0027re there in the statute, and that isn\u0027t true of the\n\n13 service salesmen.\n\n14 MR. CLEMENT: Here, Justice Breyer ­­\n\n15 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what about that?\n\n16 MR.

Because\n\n6 most customers of auto ­­ automobile dealerships who\n\n7 need service themselves work pretty regular hours, sort\n\n8 of 9:00 to 5:00, Monday through Friday. So the busy\n\n9 times at a dealership are what they call the morning\n\n10 rush and the afternoon discharge for the day.

And the Labor Department of course asked for\n\n22 deference, but they\u0027re ­­ they\u0027re studiously vague about\n\n23 what they\u0027d like you to defer to.\n\n24 And if you look at what they did in 2011, I\n\n25 don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything you can really defer to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n              \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n              \n\n               \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                          \n\n       \n\n                \n\n         \n\n              \n\n             \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                             \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n         \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n                  \n\n        \n\n13\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 there. Because up until 2011, the interpretive rights\n\n2 that date back to 1970 had a specific provision, (c)(4),\n\n3 that addressed service advisors, and it explained the\n\n4 rationale why service advisors weren\u0027t exempt. I don\u0027t\n\n5 think it was particularly persuasive to any of the\n\n6 courts, but at least there was something that addressed\n\n7 service advisors specifically.\n\n8 Now, in 2011 in the process of this\n\n9 notice­and­comment rulemaking, they actually removed\n\n10 that entirely. So the interpretive regs no longer have\n\n11 anything that addresses the service advisors\n\n12 specifically.

Petitioner\n\n17 has essentially conceded in his argument that what we\u0027re\n\n18 really talking is people who aren\u0027t paid on commission.\n\n19 Those people are who Congress was concerned about,\n\n20 people who fall outside of 207(i), and there\u0027s no reason\n\n21 to expand 213(b)(1)(A) to cover them.\n\n22 So first, when Congress enacted the statute\n\n23 in 1974, and this ­­ you can see this on page 2A of the\n\n24 government\u0027s appendix, you can see the difference of\n\n25 what Congress did.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                          \n\n              \n\n            \n\n             \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                \n\n           \n\n                              \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n   \n\n                            \n\n           \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n               \n\n              \n\n               \n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n47\n\n1 Prior to 1974, there was a single exemption,\n\n2 salesmen, partsmen and mechanics.

of Reddendo\n\n2 and the recognition of distributive phrasing is not that\n\n3 you have to read the statute that way, but what it does\n\n4 suggest is that there is no such basic rule of grammar\n\n5 that requires the use of \"or\" to link every antecedent\n\n6 noun with all antecedent gerunds. The question is\n\n7 whether it\u0027s ambiguous.\n\n8 So if we get into ambiguity, the agency has\n\n9 construed this statute in notice­and­comment rulemaking.\n\n10 That is entitled to deference.\n\n11 Now, before ­­\n\n12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yang, why was it ­­ I\n\n13 mean, for the most part this explanation seems like not\n\n14 the world\u0027s best explanation to me but perfectly\n\n15 adequate.

But it is a little bit perplexing\n\n20 as to why they took this out. Why was that?\n\n21 MR.

Well, the service\n\n20 advisors take part in servicing, just like the partsmen\n\n21 take part in servicing.\n\n22 Mr. Chief Justice, if you have any questions\n\n23 about what the service advisors do, a good place to look\n\n24 is the complaint.
