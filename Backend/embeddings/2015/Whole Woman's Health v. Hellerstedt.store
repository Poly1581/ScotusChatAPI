court has said that if the ASC\n\n10 regulation goes into effect, there will be one facility\n\n11 left in Austin, two in Dallas, one in Fort Worth, two in\n\n12 Houston, and either one or two in San

VERRILLI, JR.\n\n6 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\n\n7 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\n\n8 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\n9 may it please the Court:\n\n10 The effects of the Texas law at issue in\n\n11 this case are much more extreme than those of any\n\n12 abortion law that this Court has considered since Casey.\n\n13 This law closes most abortion facilities in\n\n14 the State, puts extreme stress on the few facilities\n\n15 that remain open, and exponentially increases the\n\n16 obstacles confronting women who seek abortions in the\n\n17 State. And it does all of that on the basis of a\n\n18 medical justification that cannot withstand any\n\n19 meaningful scrutiny that the American Medical\n\n20 Association has told you is groundless and that the\n\n21 district court found will actually operate in practice\n\n22 to increase health risks to women and not decrease.\n\n23 JUSTICE ALITO: Is this true of every\n\n24 provision of the ­­ of the ASC law?\n\n25 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I ­­ I don\u0027t think it\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n \n\n                         \n\n   \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                             \n\n                \n\n             \n\n              \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n           \n\n             \n\n            \n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n1 is true about every provision in the regulations,\n\n2 Justice Alito.\n\n3 JUSTICE ALITO: Not the regulations ­­ yes,\n\n4 in the regulations.\n\n5 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.\n\n6 JUSTICE ALITO: Every single provision.\n\n7 Then why was the whole thing held to be\n\n8 unconstitutional?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"22","file_name":"Whole Woman\u0027s Health v.

I think\n\n2 with respect to those, there\u0027s ample evidence.\n\n3 With respect to the ­­ with respect to the\n\n4 admitting­privileges requirement, we know that 11 of the\n\n5 20 clinics that closed between the date when the law was\n\n6 enacted and the effective date of the\n\n7 admitting­privileges requirement closed on the date that\n\n8 that requirement became effective. Seems to me the only\n\n9 reasonable inference you can draw with respect to those\n\n10 11 is that that law caused the closure. With respect to\n\n11 the others, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s evidence with respect\n\n12 to each one, but with respect to several, there is\n\n13 evidence that they closed in advance of the effective\n\n14 date, because they were otherwise going to have to pay a\n\n15 licensing fee to stay open for another year, which they\n\n16 knew they were not. And they knew they weren\u0027t going to\n\n17 be able to stay open, and they didn\u0027t want to flush the\n\n18 money away.

KELLER: Well, here, the evidence in the\n\n8 record showed that this particular clinic was 1 mile\n\n9 across the border that was still in the El Paso\n\n10 metroplex, and women in El Paso often used that facility\n\n11 to obtain abortions.\n\n12 So that would go into the contextual\n\n13 analysis of this particular as­applied challenge. This\n\n14 doesn\u0027t go to the facial challenge, but the as­applied\n\n15 challenge and whether women in El Paso do have access to\n\n16 abortion.\n\n17 In any event, over 90 percent of Texas women\n\n18 of reproductive age live within 150 miles of an open\n\n19 clinic as of today.\n\n20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Keller, the ­­ the\n\n21 statistics that I gleaned from the record were that","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"36","file_name":"Whole Woman\u0027s Health v.

And that would be the facial challenge\n\n9 standard, that at a minimum, a large fraction of cases,\n\n10 there would have to be invalidity even if there was an\n\n11 undue burden.\n\n12 The travel distance of ­­ even in Casey, the\n\n13 district court found over 40 percent of Pennsylvania\n\n14 women were going to have to travel at least one hour,\n\n15 sometimes over three hours, and there was a 24­hour\n\n16 waiting period. Texas reduces that waiting period to\n\n17 two hours for traveling over 100 miles. And in Casey,\n\n18 that was not a facial substantial obstacle.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"37","file_name":"Whole Woman\u0027s Health v.

As to whether what the State\u0027s\n\n19 interest would be, that would be going to a rational\n\n20 basis review or maybe a purpose­based analysis. But you\n\n21 need the clearest proof under the Court\u0027s general\n\n22 doctrine about unconstitutional purpose.

There is evidence in the record that Killeen, McCallen\n\n19 and El Paso, three clinics, closed preemptively. They\n\n20 brought as­applied challenges in McCallen and prevailed.\n\n21 They brought their as­applied challenge in El Paso and\n\n22 did not prevail. And the Killeen clinic did not seek\n\n23 as­applied relief.\n\n24 Indeed, if there are any future concerns,\n\n25 as­applied challenges can be raised. For instance, the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                     \n\n             \n\n                      \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                           \n\n       \n\n                   \n\n                         \n\n                      \n\n                    \n\n                \n\n               \n\n               \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n     \n\nOfficial\n\n69\n\n1 wide swath of area in West Texas that does not have an\n\n2 abortion clinic today, there was no as­applied relief\n\n3 sought in this case.

TOTI: Thank you.\n\n13 A few brief points. First, the record cites\n\n14 from earlier evidence that HB2 caused clinics to close\n\n15 in Texas. The plaintiffs testified that HB2 caused\n\n16 clinics in Killeen, Austin, Beaumont, McAllen, and El\n\n17 Paso to close, and that testimony is at JA 339, 715, 722\n\n18 and 731.\n\n19 Respondents stipulated at JA 183 and 184\n\n20 that the ASC requirement would cause any licensed\n\n21 abortion facility still operating on the day it took\n\n22 effect to close.\n\n23 Plaintiffs\u0027 Exhibit 28 at page 2, which is\n\n24 not in the Joint Appendix but was admitted in the record\n\n25 at 2808 and 09, demonstrates that for the five years\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n         \n\n                              \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n             \n\n     \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n                           \n\n                         \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                          \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n         \n\n              \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                   \n\n \n\n                         \n\n              \n\n74\n\nOfficial\n\n1 prior to the enactment of HB2, the number of abortion\n\n2 clinics in Texas remained fairly constant.\n\n3 And finally, at JA 229 and 1430, there is ­­\n\n4 at 229, testimony from Dr. Grossman, and at 439, our\n\n5 response to the Fifth Circuit\u0027s directive showing that\n\n6 11 clinics closed on the day that the\n\n7 admitting­privileges requirement was ­­","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"72","file_name":"Whole Woman\u0027s Health v.
