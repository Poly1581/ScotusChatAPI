where a district court is telling a jury to go back and\n\n5 reach an entirely different verdict.\n\n6 With respect to the policy considerations, I\n\n7 do think that there are policy considerations that\n\n8 strongly support the bright­line rule that we are\n\n9 advocating. As we point out in our brief, fairness and\n\n10 finality considerations point strongly in our direction.\n\n11 And while it is certainly true the district\n\n12 courts are able to engage in prejudice inquiries, we\n\n13 think the risk of prejudice is particularly great in\n\n14 this context.

The rule we would apply is that if this is a\n\n6 situation where before the discharge the judge could\n\n7 have sent it back to the jury with a clarifying\n\n8 instruction, then the mere formal pronouncement of\n\n9 discharge does not bar the judge from doing that in a\n\n10 situation where no actual prejudice would result.\n\n11 The reason I said I think that relates to an\n\n12 area of confusion in this case is that in his argument\n\n13 up here, Petitioner\u0027s counsel has characterized this as\n\n14 a weight of the evidence problem. But that\u0027s not how\n\n15 Petitioner or the judge understood the problem below.\n\n16 They understood the problem as a legally impermissible\n\n17 verdict that demonstrated that the jurors were confused\n\n18 about the instructions, and Petitioner has not\n\n19 contested, as this case comes to the court, that the\n\n20 judge could have sent it back to the jury before\n\n21 discharge.

the discharge and resubmitting the case.\n\n5 And for reasons we\u0027ve set out in the brief,\n\n6 we think the prejudice standard comports with how this\n\n7 Court always thinks about jury impartiality issues.\n\n8 In far more extreme circumstances, take the\n\n9 foundational Remmer decision. That was a criminal case\n\n10 in which a juror ­­ there was an attempted bribe to a\n\n11 juror and then the FBI investigation of that juror for\n\n12 the attempted bribe. So the juror had a huge incentive\n\n13 to quit at that point because he had been bribed by the\n\n14 defendant to ­­ excuse me ­­ to convict, because he had\n\n15 been bribed by the defendant to convict. The FBI knows\n\n16 he\u0027s been bribed.

It is that, consistent with the common\n\n4 law and the Federal rules, a district court lacks the\n\n5 authority to recall discharged jurors for further\n\n6 service in the same case, with \"discharge\" being defined\n\n7 as the point at which a jury released from service\n\n8 leaves the judge\u0027s presence and control.\n\n9 In writing an opinion in that direction, we\n\n10 would respectfully submit that the Court should\n\n11 reiterate the district courts have multiple available\n\n12 remedies to cure the perceived problem here.\n\n13 Again, we do freely concede, as Mr. Katyal\n\n14 points out, that a district court has the authority to\n\n15 reinstruct the jury and to order the jury to engage in\n\n16 further deliberations prior to discharge, and that will\n\n17 take care of many of the cases in the category of\n\n18 obvious errors.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"49","file_name":"Dietz v.

And the relevant Federal\n\n14 Rule of Evidence, Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), makes\n\n15 clear that that is an exception to the ordinary\n\n16 applicable rule that evidence from jury deliberations is\n\n17 inadmissible.\n\n18 And of course, finally, the last available","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"50","file_name":"Dietz v.
