So that\u0027s exactly,\n\n8 perhaps, what I ­­ I read the question, the first\n\n9 question. I\u0027m taking it literally. It said, \"Whether\n\n10 differences among individual class members may be\n\n11 ignored, liability and damages will be determined with\n\n12 statistical techniques that assume everyone is like the\n\n13 average.\"\n\n14 Now, I thought the answer to that question\n\n15 is yes, and it depends, of course; you have to be\n\n16 reasonable. I mean, that\u0027s why you use the four rooms.\n\n17 We don\u0027t know everybody in the room. What we do is we\n\n18 take an average in the room.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n17 please the Court:\n\n18 Justice Kennedy, I\u0027d like to begin with your\n\n19 question about the proper standard to apply here. The\n\n20 government thinks it\u0027s the standard that the jury was\n\n21 instructed on, and this appears at JA 471\n\n22 The jury was told in this case\n\n23 could only rely on representative evidence\n\n24 employees performed substantially similar\n\n25 and that substantial similarity is what we\n\nto 472.\n\nthat they\n\nif all of the\n\nactivities,\n\nthink is the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                      \n\n                   \n\n     \n\n                           \n\n               \n\n             \n\n             \n\n         \n\n               \n\n             \n\n           \n\n   \n\n                              \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\n1 proper standard to determine whether an inference here\n\n2 would be just and reasonable.\n\n3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think ­­ how\n\n4 do you know they relied on the representative evidence?\n\n5 The number was ­­ was more than 50 percent of what was\n\n6 asked. The expert was cross­examined. We don\u0027t know,\n\n7 for example ­­ they rejected the 18 minutes but accepted\n\n8 the 21 minutes. The fact that the jury did not give you\n\n9 the damages sought seems to me to call into question the\n\n10 significance of the statistics.\n\n11 MS. PRELOGAR: Well, I think it calls into\n\n12 question whether the jury agreed with the actual time\n\n13 estimates, but I don\u0027t think it undermines the\n\n14 conclusion that they found that there was proper\n\n15 representative evidence here because they were\n\n16 instructed that they couldn\u0027t award a recovery to the\n\n17 class until all of the nontestifying employees, unless","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"47","file_name":"Tyson Foods, Inc. v.
