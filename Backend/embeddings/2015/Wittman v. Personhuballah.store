Is anyone\n\n9 arguing that that incumbent couldn\u0027t challenge the order\n\n10 that severely hampers his or her chances for\n\n11 re­election, the answer is clearly yes. Since\n\n12 Representative Forbes in the adjacent district has\n\n13 suffered precisely the same kind of injury, as I had\n\n14 hypothesized for the incumbent in District 3 by analogy\n\n15 to Hays, obviously he has standing to appeal.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"10","file_name":"Wittman v.

Because normally, were ­­ were it not for\n\n4 the Voting Rights Act, there would be a very simple\n\n5 answer to all of these questions, and that is that you\n\n6 cannot take race in account at all. It\u0027s invidious\n\n7 discrimination to take governmental action on the basis\n\n8 of race.\n\n9 Does Shelby County have any relevance to\n\n10 this case? Is this the type of case that will never\n\n11 come up again in the future if the Voting Rights Act is\n\n12 not amended?\n\n13 MR. CARVIN: Right. You need not worry\n\n14 about this in 2022, but the issue here, Justice Alito,\n\n15 is what was the reality confronting the legislature in\n\n16 2012? And they had to get preclearance by the Justice\n\n17 Department in record time, so they needed to get very\n\n18 quick preclearance, which is why it made eminently good\n\n19 sense not to go ­­ go below the benchmark BVAP.\n\n20 But even if we assume, to get back to\n\n21 Justice Kagan\u0027s question, that they just plucked\n\n22 50 percent out of the air, it still doesn\u0027t establish a\n\n23 violation because this Court has said countless times,\n\n24 race is always a factor in redistricting.

That\n\n19 is quite different than saying that the Virginia\n\n20 legislature had a policy of protecting incumbents.
