CLEMENT: Now, if ­­ rather, if Nevada\n\n2 did the exact same thing to a citizen of California in a\n\n3 damage cap that applied not to sovereigns but to\n\n4 citizens, I read my friend on page 52 of his brief to\n\n5 say that that would violate the Privileges and\n\n6 Immunities Clause of Article IV, that you couldn\u0027t just\n\n7 say, well, no, that\u0027s a benefit only for Nevada\n\n8 residents.\n\n9 So his position ultimately is the sovereign\n\n10 is worse off than the citizen, which can\u0027t be right.\n\n11 Now, I think there are two ways to respond\n\n12 to that complete anomaly. One is to say that, although\n\n13 maybe it\u0027s not right there in the text of it, that the\n\n14 principles of Article IV\u0027s Full Faith and Credit Clause\n\n15 provide the same principle, the same protection that the\n\n16 Privileges and Immunities Clause applies to a citizen.\n\n17 But I think ultimately the better way to\n\n18 look at it is to say the reason the framers put the\n\n19 Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the\n\n20 unamended Constitution is they realized States could be\n\n21 sued in other States\u0027 courts.

And therefore, if another sovereign\n\n15 is going to come into that territory and act contrary to\n\n16 the laws of the sovereign, it can only do that with the\n\n17 consent of the home sovereign.

And\n\n19 therefore, when the States were concerned about\n\n20 ratifying the Constitution because of their war debts,\n\n21 they raised questions, and the Framers, like Madison and\n\n22 Hamilton, so on and so forth, gave them assurances.

First of\n\n24 all, my friend on the other side quite rightly points\n\n25 out that the States, burdened with their war debts, were\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                          \n\n               \n\n               \n\n              \n\n               \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                            \n\n           \n\n              \n\n              \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                          \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                \n\n54\n\nOfficial\n\n1 very, very concerned that they would be haled in front\n\n2 of the new Federal courts, so they sought an assurance.\n\n3 And the clearest place to see the assurance\n\n4 that they got is Federalist No. 81, where Alexander\n\n5 Hamilton makes clear that there\u0027s nothing to worry about\n\n6 here because they have sovereign immunity. And they\n\n7 have sovereign immunity as an inherent aspect of their\n\n8 sovereignty.\n\n9 And that assurance then becomes the\n\n10 postulate that this Court applies in Hans against\n\n11 Louisiana, and applies in Monaco against Mississippi,\n\n12 and all of these other cases where the immunity that\u0027s\n\n13 provided by the Constitution is actually greater than\n\n14 the text of the Eleventh Amendment. The assurance and\n\n15 the postulate are one and the same.\n\n16 Now, it may be that in the world of\n\n17 international relations, we\u0027ve wandered away from the\n\n18 Hamilton Federalist No. 81 understanding. But I don\u0027t\n\n19 think that matters. If it\u0027s constitutionalized, as it\n\n20 is in every other context, then the understanding in\n\n21 1789 is what controls.\n\n22 Now, as to the all­important point of this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"52","file_name":"Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v.

We\u0027ve talked about this idea that the\n\n6 Privileges and Immunities Clause prevent Nevada from\n\n7 doing this to a citizen.\n\n8 Here\u0027s another anomaly. Now, my friend\n\n9 suggested briefly as a parenthetical that there\u0027s\n\n10 nothing that these ­­ these poor Nevada citizens are\n\n11 going to be able to do. One thing they can do is go to\n\n12 California and sue consistent with California\u0027s waiver\n\n13 of sovereign immunity. As we point out in the reply\n\n14 brief, there are some remedies there.\n\n15 But the other thing they can do, as Justice\n\n16 Kennedy pointed out for the Court in Alden, is there is\n\n17 still the possibility of an individual capacity suit\n\n18 against one of the California officers.\n\n19 Now, here\u0027s something anomalous: If you\n\n20 sued the California officer, who\u0027s presumably a\n\n21 California resident, they would have the protection of\n\n22 removal to Federal court, so they\u0027d at least be given a","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"54","file_name":"Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v.
