ROWLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 The Speedy Trial Clause applies to a\n\n11 criminal prosecution through its culmination in\n\n12 sentencing. It is not cut off when the defendant pleads\n\n13 or is found guilty. The Court has said that the clause\n\n14 guarantees an early and proper disposition of a criminal\n\n15 charge, and that guarantee applies to the guilt stage of\n\n16 a prosecution when most defendants plead guilty and to\n\n17 the sentencing stage, which may be the only place in a\n\n18 criminal prosecution today when a defendant actually\n\n19 mounts a defense.\n\n20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the Federal Speedy\n\n21 Trial Act ­­ not the constitutional provision, but the\n\n22 legislation ­­ does that cover sentencing, or is that\n\n23 limited to trial?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Betterman v.

ROWLEY: Your Honor, the impartial jury\n\n7 clause doesn\u0027t cut off or limit the word \"trial.\" We\n\n8 know that because the Court has recognized that the\n\n9 public trial right might apply at a suppression hearing,\n\n10 and there\u0027s no jury convened at a suppression hearing.\n\n11 The Court concluded that in Waller. So the impartial\n\n12 jury clause applies to the portions of a criminal\n\n13 prosecution, the stages of a prosecution where a jury is\n\n14 actually impaneled. And if you go back to the purpose\n\n15 of an ­­ of the impartial jury clause, which was to\n\n16 prevent jurors from offering evidence against the\n\n17 defendant, it makes good sense that it would apply to\n\n18 the stages of a criminal prosecution where a jury is\n\n19 convened.\n\n20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Rowley, if we were\n\n21 to disagree with you and say that there\u0027s no Sixth\n\n22 Amendment right and there was only a due process right,\n\n23 have you waived any argument that you meet the due\n\n24 process standard?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"5","file_name":"Betterman v.

It is the\n\n10 test that other courts that have rejected the Sixth\n\n11 Amendment\u0027s speedy trial rights application at\n\n12 sentencing, they have pivoted to the due process test in\n\n13 Lovasco, and that test creates a significant burden.\n\n14 JUSTICE KAGAN: For example, Mr. Rowley,\n\n15 just to continue on this line of questioning, there\u0027s\n\n16 another case that we have which dealt with civil\n\n17 forfeitures, which is the $8,850 in U.S. currency case\n\n18 where it said, Well, we\u0027re going to do a due process\n\n19 analysis, but we\u0027re going to take the Barker factors as\n\n20 our test for that due process analysis.\n\n21 So I think one of the questions that Justice\n\n22 Sotomayor is asking is: Why wouldn\u0027t that be equally\n\n23 appropriate here? In other words, even if ­­ and I\u0027m\n\n24 not saying that this is right, but even if there\u0027s ­­\n\n25 this is ­­ falls within the due process box rather than\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n             \n\n       \n\n             \n\n               \n\n               \n\n              \n\n                             \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n       \n\n10\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"7","file_name":"Betterman v.

We submit that if you compare the outcome\n\n10 here and compare the outcome in Burkett, Burkett\n\n11 involved a defendant who advanced a very similar theory\n\n12 of prejudice. The theory was he was denied access to\n\n13 rehabilitation programs and that he suffered anxiety.\n\n14 The defendant testified to that effect, and the Third\n\n15 Circuit concluded that in the absence of contrary\n\n16 evidence, that that was enough to state or to show a\n\n17 Sixth Amendment violation.\n\n18 Whereas in ­­ in the decision below, the\n\n19 Montana Supreme Court placed the burden squarely on\n\n20 Mr. Betterman to make an affirmative showing of\n\n21 substantial prejudice.

And, importantly, it\n\n7 leaves defendants with other means of challenging\n\n8 unjustified sentencing delay without requiring the court\n\n9 having to modify both the test and the remedy for a\n\n10 speedy trial violation.\n\n11 The Speedy Trial Clause is unique among\n\n12 Sixth Amendment rights because it goes to the heart of\n\n13 the government\u0027s authority to try a presumptively\n\n14 innocent defendant at all. If the government\n\n15 unjustifiably delays, it may forfeit the right, which is\n\n16 why dismissal is the remedy.\n\n17 Sentencing delay doesn\u0027t impact the validity\n\n18 of trial. It doesn\u0027t impact the authority of the\n\n19 government to bring a defendant to trial. And after\n\n20 conviction, none of the interests that are supported by\n\n21 the Speedy Trial Clause apply. For example, there can\n\n22 be no anxiety over public accusation because the\n\n23 accusation has been confirmed.

I don\u0027t see a problem with liberty.\n\n4 MR. ROWLEY: Well, Your Honor, the point is\n\n5 simply that the Speedy Trial test that the court\n\n6 articulated in Barker is better suited to the specific\n\n7 forms of prejudice that are at issue in this case,\n\n8 because it addresses this concern with even a defendant\n\n9 who\u0027s been guilty, accessing rehabilitation programs, or\n\n10 the anxiety that that defendant may feel at the\n\n11 sentencing stage.\n\n12 And this gets to another point that the\n\n13 United States made, and that is that ­­ that the\n\n14 conviction changes everything, because the concerns that\n\n15 the court articulated in Barker may yet be more\n\n16 significant at the sentencing stage, given that most\n\n17 convictions today result from guilty pleas.\n\n18 And so the fact that a defendant ­­ their\n\n19 defense may be impaired by a delay in criminal\n\n20 proceedings, may be more significant at the sentencing\n\n21 stage because it may be the only place where the\n\n22 defendant challenges an upward adjustment or contests\n\n23 facts.\n\n24 The fact that the defendant may need to\n\n25 access rehabilitation programs may be more pronounced at\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n         \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                            \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                            \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                  \n\n                \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n50\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 sentencing because the defendant\u0027s already been\n\n2 convicted, they\u0027re going to serve time, and they want to\n\n3 get access to the programs that they\u0027ll need to get\n\n4 parole as soon as ­­ as possible.\n\n5 So we submit that ­­ that Barker is the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"48","file_name":"Betterman v.
