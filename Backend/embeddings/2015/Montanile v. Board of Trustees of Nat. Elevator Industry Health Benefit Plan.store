STRIS: It is nothing in the record to\n\n5 indicate that, but I think as far as the rules work, it\n\n6 wouldn\u0027t matter because the rules for equitable lien by\n\n7 agreement, the tracing rules, are actually very robust,\n\n8 Justice Kagan. And so as equity evolved, you cannot\n\n9 dissipate money by putting it in its own account and\n\n10 spending it. Something called the \"lowest intermediate\n\n11 balance rule\" developed to prevent against precisely the\n\n12 kind of mischief that we would reasonably worry about.\n\n13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Stris, it does\n\n14 make a difference, because if he just put it, say, in\n\n15 the bank account where he had all of his other money,\n\n16 then how ­­ how could we say that he spent all of the\n\n17 proceeds on childcare and living expenses? If you have\n\n18 one mixed pot, how can we say, oh, yes, this came from\n\n19 the settlement and not from his general funds?\n\n20 MR. STRIS: It\u0027s a very fair question,\n\n21 Justice Ginsburg.

So the first thing I\u0027m going to tell you is\n\n15 that usually when that\u0027s the case, there is an error on\n\n16 the part of the Plan. And our view is even if there\n\n17 were no remedy, that it\u0027s not consistent with the\n\n18 purposes of ERISA or the way historical equity practice\n\n19 worked to make the participant the insurer of that type\n\n20 of error.\n\n21 Now, there are remedies, and here\u0027s what\n\n22 they are under ERISA.

But\n\n20 it\u0027s also been true since Great­West that because of\n\n21 that, plans have a need to counter those incentives by\n\n22 diligently protecting their rights.\n\n23 And so I think the way that the Court rules\n\n24 in this case is not going to affect the existence of","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"18","file_name":"Montanile v.

And so I think the way that the Court rules\n\n24 in this case is not going to affect the existence of\n\n25 those incentives on the part of beneficiaries or the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n

So I think it\u0027s\n\n2 important to keep in mind here that the only reason this\n\n3 issue comes up in this case is that the Plan wasn\u0027t\n\n4 diligent, that the Plan waited for months when it knew\n\n5 that it had a reimbursement claim, and that that was\n\n6 being disputed. It didn\u0027t seek an injunction. It\n\n7 didn\u0027t file suit.\n\n8 So yes, I think this is a situation that is\n\n9 unlike the mine run of cases where we see that plans\n\n10 since Great­West have developed measures that they can\n\n11 take in order to protect their rights.\n\n12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Anders, in\n\n13 Great­West, the government filed on the side of the\n\n14 Plan. What led the government to shift its position?\n\n15 MS.

ANDERS: I agree with my friend that the\n\n4 commingling rule at equity, I think, reflected the fact\n\n5 that once funds have been dissipated, the lienholder can\n\n6 no longer collect. So the way it worked was that if you\n\n7 had funds in your account that ­­ and you spent them,\n\n8 that at first it would be presumed that you were\n\n9 spending your own money.\n\n10 But ­­ but once you got down below the\n\n11 amount that ­­ that was originally subject to the lien,\n\n12 the lienholder would only be able to enforce against\n\n13 whatever remained in that account even if it wasn\u0027t\n\n14 sufficient to satisfy the lien amount.\n\n15 So it\u0027s basically the same dissipation rule\n\n16 that applies in cases that don\u0027t involve commingling.\n\n17 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can\u0027t ­­ in a case\n\n18 where there\u0027s no time problem ­­ forget the delays and\n\n19 so forth ­­ but like this one, the Plan sue the lawyer?\n\n20 I mean, if there was $500,000 and the lawyer received","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"21","file_name":"Montanile v.

what Congress could do is it\n\n15 could weigh that potential against the downside to the\n\n16 Plan, the fact that, since Great­West, they have ­­ they\n\n17 have had these obligations, they have needed to\n\n18 diligently protect their rights, and, I think, in the\n\n19 mine­run of cases, they\u0027ve been able to do so.\n\n20 So I think those are the things that\n\n21 Congress could weigh in looking at the policy ­­ policy\n\n22 concerns on either side of this.\n\n23 And that\u0027s why we think those concerns\n\n24 really shouldn\u0027t drive the analysis here.

KATYAL\n\n17 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\n18 MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n19 and may it please the Court:\n\n20 Three things are undisputed.\n\n21 First, that Montanile signed a form saying,\n\n22 quote, \"I agree to reimburse in full the Plan from any\n\n23 settlement.\"\n\n24 Second, the Plan provides that such funds\n\n25 are, quote, \"Assets of the Plan not distributable to any\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n         \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n       \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n         \n\n                 \n\n              \n\n             \n\n   \n\n                           \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                             \n\n                     \n\n                      \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n     \n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\n1 person without the Plan\u0027s written release.\"\n\n2 And third, under Sereboff, that the Plan\n\n3 would have an enforcement claim under 502(a)(3) if\n\n4 Montanile still possessed the funds.\n\n5 What we\u0027re disagreeing about is whether\n\n6 Montanile\u0027s decision to commit a second wrong of\n\n7 spending the Plan\u0027s money himself has made him\n\n8 judgment­proof. And the answer is no for a very simple\n\n9 reason: When a right under equity has attached and a\n\n10 defendant then knowingly frustrates that equitable\n\n11 claim, it is absolutely part of equity to permit that\n\n12 claim.

All we\u0027re saying is that you can recover the value of\n\n7 the lien itself when someone frustrates an equitable\n\n8 claim that otherwise exists.\n\n9 And we point to three different traditions\n\n10 in equity that permit you to do that: substitutionary\n\n11 monetary decrees, deficiency judgments, and swollen\n\n12 assets. All of those reflect the basic idea that\n\n13 someone shouldn\u0027t profit from their second wrong, their\n\n14 wrongdoing of dissipating a fund.\n\n15 So look, there is a ­­ they\u0027re absolutely\n\n16 right. The general rule is that you can\u0027t recover from\n\n17 general assets. That is absolutely right. But there\u0027s\n\n18 an urban legend that ­­ that I think the briefs try and\n\n19 spin around that rule, to say that that general rule\n\n20 encompasses a situation when someone acts wrongfully to\n\n21 dissipate a fund, as to which someone has a claim.\n\n22 And that circumstance, Justice Holmes\u0027s\n\n23 opinion in Otis says, he says, if the complaint, quote,\n\n24 \"seeks the recovery of an identified fund, that\n\n25 complaint will not fail because the fund is gone and\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n            \n\n             \n\n   \n\n                  \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                         \n\n           \n\n                            \n\n                \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n              \n\n                             \n\n                           \n\n                             \n\n \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n       \n\n                       \n\nOfficial\n\n34\n\n1 misappropriated by the defendants.

KATYAL: Right. I\u0027m certainly not\n\n5 trying to do that. All I\u0027m saying is that the policy\n\n6 arguments here, I do think, are substantial and have\n\n7 weight. The amicus briefs, before you say, over a\n\n8 billion dollars each year is recovered through these\n\n9 reimbursement actions. And ­­ and if you adopt their\n\n10 plan, then as you were saying as to my friend, you\u0027re\n\n11 going to just tell the client ­­ you are ­­ telling the\n\n12 Montaniles of the world, spend that money right away.\n\n13 Settle the case at 10:00, and by 10:01 spend all the\n\n14 money. And in that circumstance, then Plans are out of\n\n15 luck. Innocent beneficiaries, that means, are out of\n\n16 luck, and people like Mr. Montanile get a double\n\n17 recovery. And equity is not so brittle. There is no\n\n18 tradition in equity that supports this idea.\n\n19 As, Justice Alito, you were saying, how\n\n20 could this make any sense? It didn\u0027t make sense at\n\n21 equity. Equity has always been more flexible than that.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"39","file_name":"Montanile v.

this goes to Justice Breyer\u0027s question.\n\nI mean, there\u0027s\n\n12 actually a circuit split on this question about can you\n\n13 go after the lawyer, and the reason why you may not be\n\n14 able to go after the lawyer is the lawyer is not a party\n\n15 to the underlying agreement.\n\n16 And that\u0027s what I think the Eighth Circuit\n\n17 says in contradistinction to others. And so that\u0027s ­­\n\n18 that ­­ that it is ­­ that is not a great remedy. And,\n\n19 of course, it requires the lawyer to be on notice of the\n\n20 Plan and all the reimbursement obligations and the like.\n\n21 Under equity, Justice Sotomayor, I think the\n\n22 idea is that when someone has made a valid promise to ­­\n\n23 for these funds, such as here, Montanile knew that he\n\n24 was playing with house money. He knew that these\n\n25 weren\u0027t his ­­ this wasn\u0027t his money; it was the Plan\u0027s\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                    \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                        \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                         \n\n                    \n\n                       \n\n       \n\n                           \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n     \n\n                        \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n                 \n\nOfficial\n\n45\n\n1 money from the start. And then he goes and spends that\n\n2 money on other things. Yes, you can go after his\n\n3 general assets to recover that spending on other things.\n\n4 And that is something amply supported by\n\n5 these three different traditions in the case law.

Tracing is just a lien­priority doctrine.\n\n21 It\u0027s nothing more than that.\n\nThe Restatement that my\n\n22 friend cites on the other side that is cited in Knudson\n\n23 in Section 215 is as clear as day. It just talks about\n\n24 lien priority. It doesn\u0027t say that there is no claim if\n\n25 general ­­ if ­­ if someone dissipates a fund.

So if Mr. Montanile owes\n\n10 somebody money, he ­­ it\u0027s all right if he takes money\n\n11 from the fund and pays that debt?\n\n12 MR.

Why?\n\nFor three reasons.\n\nOne, because as\n\n14 the Solicitor General\u0027s brief in Sereboff said, the\n\n15 point of ERISA is to try and give effect to written\n\n16 plans and their determinations. And if there\u0027s doubt\n\n17 into the ­­ as to what the equity tradition is, you\n\n18 should read it in light of trying to enforce Plan terms.\n\n19 That is the pages 23 and 24 of their brief. It is\n\n20 consistent with the way this Court approaches, for\n\n21 example, Title VII cases and the like.\n\n22 The second is that, again, all we\u0027re seeking\n\n23 here is a remedy. We\u0027re not trying to get more than\n\n24 what would have been otherwise available at equity.\n\n25 Our ­­ our view is that when someone frustrates an\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n                    \n\n                \n\n       \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n              \n\n               \n\n     \n\n                          \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\nOfficial\n\n54\n\n1 otherwise equitable claim, we can only try and reinstate\n\n2 that claim. You can\u0027t get more from it because of their\n\n3 second wrongdoing. So I think we\u0027re giving effect to\n\n4 what equity is all about.\n\n5 And then, third ­­ and this goes back to\n\n6 your last question to Ms. Anders, you said, you know,\n\n7 what was ­­ what was the ­­ what does \"typically\n\n8 available at equity\" mean? And you know, that test\n\n9 comes from Mertens. Mertens isolates three examples of\n\n10 what was traditionally available as equity ­­ at equity:\n\n11 mandamus, injunction, and restitution.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"55","file_name":"Montanile v.

STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n12 I\u0027d just like to make two brief points. The\n\n13 first one is that the historical authorities are\n\n14 unquestionably on our side. And it was interesting\n\n15 hearing my ­­ my friend Mr. Katyal go straight to the\n\n16 substitutionary monetary remedy. I want to say a couple\n\n17 things about this:\n\n18 First, if you look carefully, the exact\n\n19 argument he\u0027s making was rejected by the holding of this\n\n20 Court in Great­West. This is Section II C of the\n\n21 Court\u0027s opinion. It\u0027s kind of a lesser­known part of\n\n22 the opinion.\n\n23 The ­­ the argument was made that a\n\n24 beneficiary of a trust commits that second wrong that he\n\n25 was talking about when they get a loan contractually and\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                      \n\n              \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                      \n\n         \n\n                          \n\n                \n\n             \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                \n\n                  \n\n                        \n\n       \n\n                      \n\n                              \n\n                    \n\n                      \n\n       \n\n                                \n\n                   \n\n             \n\nOfficial\n\n56\n\n1 refuse to pay it back. And what this Court said is, no,\n\n2 that\u0027s not typically available in equity.

Because I\n\n2 was stunned when Mr. Katyal got up here and said, oh,\n\n3 well, the disability cases are different, like this\n\n4 doesn\u0027t extend to them. He filed a cert petition with\n\n5 respect with this Court in the Bilyeu case, which was\n\n6 one of the circuit split cases that\u0027s here. Half of the\n\n7 circuit split cases involve the disability context.\n\n8 So I\u0027ll end with this: What does that tell\n\n9 you? The fact that you look at these disability cases\n\n10 and you see that money is being advanced and it\u0027s being\n\n11 spent before the lien even attaches, and yet they\u0027re\n\n12 made part of the circuit split, and in this case\n\n13 Respondent is not willing to defend that as a policy\n\n14 position, I think what it tells you is that fair­minded\n\n15 people could disagree as to where you want to place the\n\n16 risk.\n\n17 And so when we go and look at this and we\n\n18 think about it in terms of burdens, if there is any\n\n19 reasonable position, as you look at this, that a rule\n\n20 that says you can essentially go after general assets,\n\n21 means that some meaningful number of fiduciaries will\n\n22 abuse that to assert rights they don\u0027t have or to delay,\n\n23 then I think you need to go with the clear line of\n\n24 historical authorities.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"60","file_name":"Montanile v.
