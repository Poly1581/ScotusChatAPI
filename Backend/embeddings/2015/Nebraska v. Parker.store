Parker.\n\n5 Mr. Smith.\n\n6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. SMITH\n\n7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n8 MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 For over a century, the following three\n\n11 things have been true in the disputed area.\n\n12 First, the non­Indian population has always\n\n13 been greater than 98 percent.\n\n14 Second, the Tribe never exercised\n\n15 jurisdiction.\n\n16 And third, by contrast, the State of\n\n17 Nebraska has governed the disputed area.\n\n18 The story of the disputed area is that of a\n\n19 land that long ago lost its Indian character, if it ever\n\n20 had any. The three things I mentioned at the outset\n\n21 happened for a reason. They happened because it was\n\n22 the ­­ or the intent of Congress in the context of the\n\n23 times of the 1882 Act that the disputed area would be\n\n24 diminished from the reservation.\n\n25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I understand your\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n                               \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n             \n\n      \n\n                         \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n             \n\n \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                    \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n                            \n\n             \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 position correctly, you\u0027re not asking us to overrule\n\n2 Solem?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Nebraska v.

Another\n\n5 way is to say de facto diminishment means the settlement\n\n6 patterns, and that\u0027s something that can inform the\n\n7 ultimate conclusion of whether there\u0027s diminishment.\n\n8 And I really think the Court in Solem was\n\n9 using it in that passage in the latter respect.

I think Justice Marshall was laying out\n\n22 all of the factors, starting with the first and\n\n23 governing principle, being that only Congress can\n\n24 diminish.

MR.\n\nCLEMENT: I think as a practical matter,\n\n14 Justice Ginsburg, there\u0027s two other things that are at\n\n15 stake here, and they both go to the equities of the\n\n16 Indians on the reservation, not the non­Indians, because\n\n17 the non­Indians on the reservation, the Tribal authority\n\n18 is very, very limited.\n\n19 So one thing that is at issue here is the\n\n20 potential to continue the revenue­sharing agreement with\n\n21 the State. And this is something that the State\n\n22 actually came to the Tribe about. And the theory of the\n\n23 revenue­sharing agreement for the fuel taxes is that\n\n24 there are going to be transactions in the western\n\n25 portion of the reservation where it\u0027s actually Tribal\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n        \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n              \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                              \n\n               \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                            \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                             \n\n               \n\nOfficial\n\n33\n\n1 members that are buying gasoline over there, which does\n\n2 happen, because there are a lot of gas stations over\n\n3 there.

Make it\n\n6 under the rubric City of Sherrill. Maybe you make it\n\n7 when you go down on remand or something, but it is\n\n8 workable to divide the issue into two parts.\n\n9 The first issue is what\u0027s the reservation,\n\n10 and the second issue is what can you do on the\n\n11 reservation?\n\n12 When you get to question two, if the Tribe\n\n13 has made no assertion of jurisdiction, nobody even knows\n\n14 about it for 150 years. Maybe it\u0027s basically unfair to\n\n15 let them do what they want to do. And that depends on a\n\n16 lot of factors, such as what Congress says.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"51","file_name":"Nebraska v.
