DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\n10 it please the Court:\n\n11 Congress amended the discharge bar in 1978\n\n12 to add actual fraud as an additional ground for barring\n\n13 discharge. That amendment must be given meaning. Our\n\n14 interpretation is the only one that does so.\n\n15 Consistent with the common­law understanding\n\n16 that Congress codified, \"actual fraud\" is a term of art\n\n17 that includes a recipient\u0027s knowing participation in a\n\n18 deliberate fraudulent transfer. By contrast, the Fifth\n\n19 Circuit\u0027s holding that actual fraud invariably requires\n\n20 a misrepresentation makes Congress\u0027s amendment\n\n21 superfluous because it equates actual fraud with the\n\n22 preexisting terms, \"false pretenses\" and \"false\n\n23 representation.\"\n\n24 Respondent\u0027s interpretation is even worse.\n\n25 It merely restates a preexisting scienter requirement.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n         \n\n                       \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n \n\n                         \n\n                 \n\n                       \n\n              \n\n                   \n\n       \n\n                        \n\n             \n\n                      \n\n              \n\n              \n\n           \n\n           \n\n              \n\n              \n\n4\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"Husky Int\u0027l Electronics, Inc. v.

There are three main reasons why Petitioner and\n\n5 the government are right about our interpretation of\n\n6 Section 523(a)(2)(A).\n\n7 The first is that this Court has said many\n\n8 times that when Congress uses a term that has an\n\n9 established common­law meaning, courts should give it\n\n10 that meaning when it\u0027s used in a statute.\n\n11 For centuries, the term \"actual fraud\" has\n\n12 been used at common law to refer to schemes that are\n\n13 in ­­ that ­­ that where property is transferred with\n\n14 the ­­ with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a\n\n15 creditor. There is no reason to give that text any\n\n16 different meaning than in Section 523(a)(2)(a).\n\n17 The second is that our view is the only\n\n18 thing that ­­ the only interpretation that gives any\n\n19 meaning to the 1978 amendment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"15","file_name":"Husky Int\u0027l Electronics, Inc. v.

And\n\n12 the Court said because embezzlement requires intent,\n\n13 we\u0027re going to infer from that term that fraud requires\n\n14 intent as well.\n\n15 So the basic principle that adding language\n\n16 to a statute can inform and limit the words that come\n\n17 before it is nothing that extraordinary.

It talks about a\n\n15 fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer, or a\n\n16 transfer made with intent to injure, hinder, delay, or\n\n17 defraud a creditor.\n\n18 But the other thing is that the remedies\n\n19 Congress has created for fraudulent conveyance are not\n\n20 creditor­specific.

There\u0027s a bit\n\n14 of dispute below in the ­­ in the courts of appeals\n\n15 about whether an objective substantial certainty that\n\n16 harm will result is sufficient, or you need a subjective\n\n17 substantial certainty.\n\n18 I\u0027m not sure, at the end of the day, that\n\n19 ever is an outcome determinative distinction.\n\n20 But for this case, it makes no difference at\n\n21 all, because the Fifth Circuit is the circuit that\n\n22 applies the broader objective test. And applying that\n\n23 objective text here, the Fifth Circuit concluded, as did\n\n24 the two courts below, that these transfers were not made\n\n25 with intent to injure the Petitioner, and were not even\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n \n\n                     \n\n                     \n\n                           \n\n                   \n\n              \n\n                   \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n                                \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n   \n\n45\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"43","file_name":"Husky Int\u0027l Electronics, Inc. v.

And I would note here, every\n\n6 single one of this Court\u0027s cases that involved (a)(2)\n\n7 has always had a debtor who is using fraud to induce the\n\n8 creditor to part with something. That\u0027s the way this\n\n9 statute had been understood up until the Seventh\n\n10 Circuit\u0027s decision came along and ­­ and had this new\n\n11 idea that you could get at fraudulent conveyance through\n\n12 this statute.\n\n13 Before that, it was pretty commonly\n\n14 understood that what (a)(2) was about, that\n\n15 differentiated it from other provisions, was that it was\n\n16 about fraudulent inducement. And that\u0027s the ultimate\n\n17 problem here. They may have a debt. They may have a\n\n18 debt that even involves actual fraud, but they don\u0027t\n\n19 have a debt for anything with which Petitioner was ever\n\n20 fraudulently induced to part resulting in my client\n\n21 obtaining anything by the kind of fraud that counts\n\n22 under 5 ­­ Section 523(a)(2).\n\n23 If there are no further questions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"46","file_name":"Husky Int\u0027l Electronics, Inc. v.
