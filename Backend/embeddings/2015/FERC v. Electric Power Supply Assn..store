Yes, FERC has the ­­ has the power to\n\n20 regulate wholesale rates.\n\nBut ­­ but, the argument is,\n\n21 not through the fiddling around with retail rates, which\n\n22 is what is asserted is happening here.\n\n23 GENERAL VERRILLI: So ­­ I think three\n\n24 points to be made in response to that argument, Justice\n\n25 Scalia.

But what I would say in\n\n11 response to that, Your Honor, is that if I go out and\n\n12 buy a Ferrari for $100,000, everybody thinks that the\n\n13 price of the Ferrari is $100,000. Nobody thinks that\n\n14 the price of the Ferrari is actually $107,000 because\n\n15 I\u0027m foregoing the $7,000 tax credit I can get if I\n\n16 bought an electric car. The rate is what it is.

Because trying to regulate exclusively or\n\n9 trying to ­­ to deal exclusively with the supply side\n\n10 wouldn\u0027t work, or it\u0027s not as effective as it could be,\n\n11 or certainly wouldn\u0027t necessarily guarantee you just and\n\n12 reasonable rates.\n\n13 And so tariffs were filed in order to\n\n14 provide a basis for putting in the demand side. And the\n\n15 reason why this is a direct effect on the ­­ on the\n\n16 wholesale rates is because it\u0027s an absolute one­to­one\n\n17 relationship.\n\n18 If I put in a unit of ­­ of or reduce a unit\n\n19 of demand, I don\u0027t need as much supply, and that affects\n\n20 the price directly. And that\u0027s the direct relationship\n\n21 that derives from the economic principles.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"16","file_name":"FERC v.

PAUL D. CLEMENT\n\n2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\n3 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n4 please the Court:\n\n5 I don\u0027t usually start in this Court by\n\n6 telling you who I represent, but I think I better do it\n\n7 here, which is I represent not just EPSA, which is a\n\n8 group of power generators, but a number of other ­­\n\n9 other organizations.\n\n10 So the vast majority of the people that I\n\n11 represent are load­serving entities who are not\n\n12 exclusively on the supply side. They\u0027re actually the\n\n13 regulated public utilities that actually could provide\n\n14 demand response in a wholesale, meaningful level by\n\n15 working, as they have since long before FERC got in this\n\n16 business, to work with retail customers and their State\n\n17 regulators to provide for reduced retail demand at peak\n\n18 time. So that\u0027s who I represent.\n\n19 Now what I\u0027d like to start, beyond telling\n\n20 you who I represent, is with the notion of what FERC was\n\n21 trying to do here, which was to reduce retail demand by\n\n22 providing payments to retail customers on an otherwise\n\n23 wholesale market in an effort to change the effective\n\n24 price for retail sales.\n\n25 Now, that sure sounds like something that\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                  \n\n                       \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n              \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n            \n\n                           \n\n            \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                       \n\n \n\n                      \n\n                     \n\n        \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                       \n\n                \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n27\n\nOfficial\n\n1 belongs to the States.

That\u0027s\n\n15 the peak hour. The industry, leaving reserves out of\n\n16 this as a fixed matter, has to supply that.

It\n\n5 says the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to\n\n6 sales of electricity at wholesale.\n\n7 One of those provisions is 824(e)(a), which\n\n8 says FERC shall have jurisdiction over practices\n\n9 affecting wholesale rates.\n\n10 So we\u0027re within the plain terms of the\n\n11 statute, and there is no statutory text that plainly\n\n12 forecloses FERC\u0027s exercise of jurisdiction. And my\n\n13 friend, in 30 minutes, didn\u0027t even try to identify one.\n\n14 So in terms of applying Chevron, there\u0027s no\n\n15 doubt that ­­ that FERC\u0027s interpretation has to be\n\n16 upheld.\n\n17 With respect to the Wal­Mart example that my\n\n18 friend identifies, I think it shows why his argument\n\n19 about hermetically­sealed­off retail and wholesale\n\n20 spheres really has nothing to do with the real world.\n\n21 In the real world today, large customers can\n\n22 buy directly. They can do it through contract, and they\n\n23 can also go into the wholesale market auctions and buy,\n\n24 if their States permit it, and that does happen in the\n\n25 real world.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                        \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                    \n\n                   \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n               \n\n        \n\n                       \n\n            \n\n             \n\n             \n\n              \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                     \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                      \n\n                        \n\n           \n\n56\n\nOfficial\n\n1 And this is really no different because\n\n2 demand response entities that want to come in and\n\n3 participate can only do so if their State law allows","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"54","file_name":"FERC v.
