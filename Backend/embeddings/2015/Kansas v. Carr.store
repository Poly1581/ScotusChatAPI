I think our proposal is\n\n16 that the constitutional standard is whether evidence or\n\n17 argument resulted in a denial of due process or the\n\n18 deprivation of an individualized sentencing proceeding.\n\n19 And that\u0027s slightly different from Kansas\u0027s\n\n20 standard, because Kansas is proposing a rule that\n\n21 involves analysis of risk, and we think that is part of\n\n22 the statutory rule under Rule 14, as Justice Sotomayor\n\n23 alluded to.

KOVNER: Well, the Eighth Amendment does\n\n10 speak to this need for an individualized sentencing\n\n11 determination. We would think that the Due Process\n\n12 Clause also requires that proceedings be individualized.\n\n13 But we would agree that if there were a situation where\n\n14 there was a joint trial and because of the evidence\n\n15 introduced by one, for instance, a jury simply could not\n\n16 give individualized consideration to a second ­­ second\n\n17 defendant, that would be a constitutional problem.\n\n18 And to give an example of that ­­ I mean, I\n\n19 think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that\n\n20 is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains\n\n21 only to one defendant, but that that aggravating\n\n22 evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that\n\n23 the jury couldn\u0027t really separate the two and would be","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"16","file_name":"Kansas v.

And is it also for both non­capital and capital?\n\n3 Are you drawing no distinctions among those four things?\n\n4 MS. KOVNER: I think that\u0027s right, Your\n\n5 Honor. I mean, that ­­ because we think that the due\n\n6 process standard essentially subsumes the requirement of\n\n7 individualized consideration, and, of course, due\n\n8 process is applicable at the trial phase and at the\n\n9 sentencing phase in capital and non­capital trials.\n\n10 JUSTICE KAGAN: So it seems a little bit\n\n11 counterintuitive to me, the idea that, you know, the\n\n12 guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact\n\n13 same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a\n\n14 capital crime and then as the sentencing phase of a\n\n15 capital crime.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"24","file_name":"Kansas v.

It was that he did things to\n\n2 Jonathan that turned Jonathan into the person who was\n\n3 capable of committing and even leading these crimes.

And it was required to consider it because\n\n20 it was part and parcel of Jonathan\u0027s mitigating\n\n21 evidence.\n\n22 And this Court has said time and again that\n\n23 a defendant has a constitutional right for the jury, not\n\n24 only to consider but to listen to a defendant\u0027s\n\n25 mitigating evidence.

We would ask that you reverse the Kansas\n\n4 Supreme Court on this point.\n\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. McAllister, I am\n\n6 sorry, but even if we do this and say that the\n\n7 sentencings didn\u0027t need to be severed, didn\u0027t the Kansas\n\n8 court hold on another ground that they were entitled to\n\n9 a new trial?\n\n10 MR. McALLISTER: Yes. So that\u0027s the third\n\n11 question presented in the Petition, which my\n\n12 understanding is that is something the Court could\n\n13 reconsider. It\u0027s not denied. The Court granted\n\n14 Questions 1 and 3.\n\n15 The other question that we presented was the\n\n16 only other ground that the Kansas Supreme Court gave for\n\n17 reversal, that\u0027s a Confrontation Clause violation in\n\n18 terms of some of the hearsay evidence presented in the\n\n19 sentencing proceedings.\n\n20 So if the Court were to reverse on these,\n\n21 deny on that question, then the Kansas Supreme Court\n\n22 could, in fact, rely on that ground. But our hope would\n\n23 be that the Court would do something different than that\n\n24 if you reverse on these two questions.\n\n25 Unless there are further questions, thank\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                       \n\n                  \n\n                          \n\n     \n\n57\n\nOfficial\n\n1 you.\n\n2\n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n\n3 The cases are submitted.\n\n4 (Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the cases in the\n\n5 above­entitled matters were submitted.)\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"54","file_name":"Kansas v.
