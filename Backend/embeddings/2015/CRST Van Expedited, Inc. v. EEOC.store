SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 On the issue we initially asked this Court\n\n12 to resolve in the petition for certiorari, the parties\n\n13 are now in complete agreement. That issue, of course,\n\n14 was whether a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case\n\n15 is barred from seeking attorneys\u0027 fees if it hasn\u0027t\n\n16 prevailed on the merits. As we showed in our opening\n\n17 brief, such a rule, which exists only in the\n\n18 Eighth Circuit, makes little sense. It doesn\u0027t ­­ it is\n\n19 certainly not compelled by the statutory language and\n\n20 doesn\u0027t serve any rationing statutory policy to take\n\n21 away the power of work fees in a ­­ in a case of a\n\n22 non­merits disposition.\n\n23 The EEOC, having staunchly defended that\n\n24 rule in its brief in opposition, executed an about­face\n\n25 in its merits brief and now agrees with us that a\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n               \n\n         \n\n                            \n\n             \n\n             \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n           \n\n       \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                     \n\n           \n\n   \n\n                     \n\n     \n\n                       \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                       \n\n           \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n4\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 non­merits disposition can be the basis of a defendant\n\n2 attorneys\u0027 fee award under Title VII.\n\n3 Now, for that reason and for all the reasons\n\n4 in our opening merits brief, which the government","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"1","file_name":"CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v.

The amount of those fees that are\n\n8 attributable to actually litigating about this ground\n\n9 here, whether or not we satisfied the preconditions to\n\n10 suit, is a little more than $100,000.\n\n11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then that may\n\n12 be a case contrary to the proposal where it\u0027s that\n\n13 discreet. In other words, your frivolity on that\n\n14 particular point compelled them to incur $4.6 million\n\n15 over many years.

It finds a\n\n19 reasonable cause to believe that there\u0027s been a\n\n20 violation of Title VII in a huge number of cases, and\n\n21 has very limited resources.

Our focus on cases for the\n\n14 argument is about why the question presented isn\u0027t\n\n15 really presented or why there\u0027s a bar to reaching it,\n\n16 and that\u0027s not what this argument is.\n\n17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, regardless of whether\n\n18 there\u0027s blame on either part, we\u0027re still in a situation\n\n19 where it really has not been briefed by one party, and\n\n20 it hasn\u0027t been thought about by the courts below.
