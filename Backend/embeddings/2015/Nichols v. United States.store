CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear argument\n\n4 first this morning in Case No. 15­5238, Nichols v.\n\n5 United States.\n\n6 Mr. Hansmeier.\n\n7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL T. HANSMEIER\n\n8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n9 MR. HANSMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\n10 it please the Court:\n\n11 Until three weeks ago, a sex offender who\n\n12 moved to a foreign country was not subject to any\n\n13 Federal registration requirement in the United States\n\n14 unless and until he returned to the United States.\n\n15 Below, the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that it is a\n\n16 Federal crime for a sex offender who moves to a foreign\n\n17 country to fail to ­­ to report that move. The Tenth\n\n18 Circuit was wrong for three overarching reasons. First,\n\n19 SORNA\u0027s text does not include a requirement to\n\n20 unregister.\n\n21 Second, SORNA\u0027s statutory history reveals\n\n22 that if Congress wanted to include a requirement to\n\n23 unregister, it would have done so just as it did before\n\n24 SORNA\u0027s enactment. And finally, a requirement to\n\n25 unregister is unnecessary because all 56 jurisdictions\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                         \n\n                  \n\n        \n\n                             \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                \n\n                \n\n               \n\n               \n\n \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n             \n\n           \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 require sex offenders to unregister. Failure to do so\n\n2 is a violation of the jurisdiction\u0027s law and not Federal\n\n3 law.\n\n4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be true of\n\n5 Kansas law in this case.

The notion that we have somebody\n\n10 on Federal supervisory release, we\u0027re supposed to be\n\n11 keeping track of him and making sure that he\u0027s not\n\n12 committing other crimes.
