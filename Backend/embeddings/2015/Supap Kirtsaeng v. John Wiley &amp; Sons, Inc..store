ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\n10 Justice, and may it please the Court:\n\n11 When Congress modified the American Rule in\n\n12 the Copyright Act, it was not just trying to punish\n\n13 those who took unreasonable positions. It wanted to\n\n14 encourage parties to advance important principles even\n\n15 where the other side\u0027s arguments are good; indeed, I\n\n16 would say, especially where the other side\u0027s arguments\n\n17 are good.\n\n18 When a defendant is trying to decide whether\n\n19 to fight for a principle, the availability of attorneys\u0027\n\n20 fees can make all the difference in that decision, and\n\n21 in turn can make all the difference in whether the\n\n22 public\u0027s rights are vindicated.\n\n23 The Second Circuit\u0027s standard flouts.

In part of that job, they do things that we would\n\n17 do worse, not better. And one of the things that they\n\n18 know is the case in front of them. And what we said in\n\n19 the ­­ our case was: It\u0027s up to them as long as they\n\n20 act reasonably. So you started with a factor, which I\n\n21 guess they could have taken into account. Nothing in\n\n22 our law prohibits it. In fact, it encourages it.\n\n23 So what\u0027s the problem? What is it? Are you\n\n24 saying we should, in fact, change what we said in\n\n25 Fogerty?

I can articulate the test in\n\n6 four sentences in a way the district courts can\n\n7 administer.\n\n8 So our rule is that a district court should\n\n9 consider the totality of the circumstances, including\n\n10 all of the Fogerty factors, and ask itself, would a fee\n\n11 award here advance the purposes of the Copyright Act?\n\n12 Is this the sort of case in which, if the same scenario\n\n13 were to present itself again, the availability of fees\n\n14 would create the right litigation centives ­­\n\n15 incentives, that is, for both parties with the right\n\n16 result for the public?\n\n17 The district court should ­­ should consider\n\n18 each of the Fogerty factors and do it through the lens\n\n19 of the purposes of the Copyright Act. It should also\n\n20 consider the significance and nature of the win and the\n\n21 litigation incentives on both sides of the deed,\n\n22 including any disparity in resources.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"15","file_name":"Supap Kirtsaeng v.

Looking at hundreds and hundreds of cases in\n\n5 the Second Circuit, in the district courts, I think that\n\n6 there is a lot of discretion that one can exercise in\n\n7 deciding whether to include cases in your count or not\n\n8 include cases in your count, whether you include default\n\n9 judgments, whether you include declaratory judgment\n\n10 situations, whether you include situations where the\n\n11 Court says as a technical matter, you can\u0027t get fees\n\n12 because your motion was late. But in the alternative,\n\n13 if I were to consider it, I would go on to award or not\n\n14 award you fees, anyway.\n\n15 So I think that there is some ground to\n\n16 quibble with some of the statistics, and I can tell you\n\n17 what statistics I came up when I did this look, which\n\n18 are a little bit different, and I think show that there\n\n19 is not this vast disparity.

defendant often looks very unreasonable by not having\n\n5 shown up to defend the case, and where the fee amount is\n\n6 quite small by necessity because not much has happened\n\n7 in the case, then

But nevertheless, like any fee­shifting\n\n5 statute, it is taking into account incentives on both\n\n6 sides, whether you should try to remove the case,\n\n7 whether you should move to remand the case if you\u0027re on\n\n8 the other side. And what happens in the copyright world\n\n9 because of this Court\u0027s Fogerty decision is that those\n\n10 incentives are judged as to plaintiffs and defendants\n\n11 because both of them can get fees, but I don\u0027t think the\n\n12 underlying policies are different.\n\n13 In Martin, the Court wasn\u0027t looking at\n\n14 anything that was specific to that statute, as to its\n\n15 history, or to any policy that was specific to that\n\n16 statute at all. But what the Court said was that\n\n17 objective reasonableness was the touchstone. And, yes,\n\n18 it may be true that in some cases where the losing party\n\n19 has been objectively reasonable, fees are appropriate,\n\n20 in any event, because this is an equitable matter, and\n\n21 we don\u0027t want to restrict the district court\u0027s\n\n22 discretion, and it\u0027s hard to imagine every single case\n\n23 that could possibly come up in the future.
