GUADAGNO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\n9 please the Court:\n\n10 Congress made a choice. Congress did not\n\n11 choose to make generic arson an aggravated felony.\n\n12 Instead, Congress chose to make Federal arson an\n\n13 aggravated felony.\n\n14 And that makes sense. The Federal arson\n\n15 statute has a minimum sentence of five years. There are\n\n16 at least 18 States with arson offenses that are\n\n17 classified as misdemeanors. Arizona and Colorado have\n\n18 misdemeanor arson offenses involving damage to property\n\n19 worth less than a hundred dollars.\n\n20 Congress would not have wanted to make such\n\n21 minor offenses aggravated felonies. We know this\n\n22 because of the statutory scheme.\n\n23 Within the aggravated felony statute, we\n\n24 have generic offenses, very serious ones like murder and\n\n25 rape.

It can be argued\n\n21 that what that means is that, when you have a Federal\n\n22 offense with a jurisdictional provision, you disregard\n\n23 the jurisdictional provision because you\u0027re never going\n\n24 to find that in a State provision.\n\n25 MR.

But I mean, there are a lot of things,\n\n20 a lot of things on that list that have jurisdictional\n\n21 hooks in them.\n\n22 So you would be excluding ­­ in addition to\n\n23 arson, you would be excluding the child pornography\n\n24 crime.

GUADAGNO: But the important point\n\n2 about ­­ about those three Federal statutes is ­­ is\n\n3 that Congress is saying that if they want jurisdictional\n\n4 elements to be ignored, they\u0027re going to say so, and\n\n5 they\u0027re going to say so with clear language, much\n\n6 clearer language than ­­ than ­­ than the penultimate\n\n7 sentence or described in, and Congress didn\u0027t ­­ didn\u0027t\n\n8 do that here.\n\n9 I mean, basically we\u0027re ­­ we\u0027re asking to\n\n10 apply the full language of ­­ of ­­ of the statute, and\n\n11 the government is saying omit things. And ­­ and to\n\n12 omit things, you need clear language.\n\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but your\n\n14 assumption is that there ­­ an element is an element is\n\n15 an element, whether it\u0027s substantive or jurisdictional.\n\n16 And that\u0027s not the way our ­­ our cases have treated","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"14","file_name":"Torres v.

I think all those things\n\n16 inform how you would understand \"described in\" but with\n\n17 respect to the question of whether \"defined in\" in this\n\n18 provision was just used to refer to dictionary\n\n19 definition­type statutory provisions. I think that that\n\n20 is true. As a descriptive matter, there are only a\n\n21 couple of \"defined in\" provisions of the aggravated\n\n22 felony statute, and they do refer to other statutes that\n\n23 say the word X means Y.\n\n24 But that\u0027s not true throughout the U.S.\n\n25 Code, which was Petitioner\u0027s original submission.

around his\n\n13 argument that arson and explosives will be covered by\n\n14 the crime of violence is that: What if a person sets\n\n15 fire to his own property?\n\n16 Now, when would a person set fire to his own\n\n17 property? When he wants to commit fraud. And here we\n\n18 have a provision that puts fraud within it. And\n\n19 moreover, it has the limitation of $10,000.

GOLDENBERG: First of all, I don\u0027t think\n\n17 it works for foreign crimes. So in a foreign crime\n\n18 situation, you can\u0027t come in and provide proof that it\n\n19 had an interstate commerce element because there\u0027s not\n\n20 really an equivalent to that on the foreign side.\n\n21 And so I just think there is a whole serious\n\n22 set of crimes that Congress wanted to include as to\n\n23 which that approach wouldn\u0027t function.\n\n24 It would also really multiply the difficulty\n\n25 of the proceedings and make them much longer and harder.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                              \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                              \n\n       \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n                               \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n         \n\n                           \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                    \n\n \n\nOfficial\n\n48\n\n1 And I do think the language here is a little\n\n2 different here than the language that the Court was\n\n3 looking at in Nijhawan, where this $10,000 limitation\n\n4 was in the aggravated felony provision itself and it was\n\n5 worded in a particular way that the Court seized on.\n\n6 I ­­ I ­­ so I just don\u0027t think that\n\n7 analysis necessarily carries over here.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"45","file_name":"Torres v.

You look\n\n16 at the elements of the crime that they were convicted\n\n17 of. And then you compare it to something that Federal\n\n18 law tells you to compare it to.\n\n19 And I think that is a question of statutory\n\n20 interpretation, what it is that you\u0027re supposed to be\n\n21 comparing it to, that the Federal law is telling you is\n\n22 the proper comparator.\n\n23 And here, that\u0027s the question we\u0027re\n\n24 answering.
