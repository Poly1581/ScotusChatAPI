GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\n\n10 please the Court:\n\n11 Our narrowest argument assumes that, in\n\n12 circumstances like this case, Indian tribes do have the\n\n13 legislative jurisdiction to subject nonmembers to tribal\n\n14 tort law duties.\n\n15 Respondents argue that the same facts also\n\n16 give Indian tribes the mandatory adjudicatory\n\n17 jurisdiction to decide private tort lawsuits against\n\n18 non­Indians. Respondents\u0027 theory is that, when the\n\n19 Tribes entered the United States and were incorporated\n\n20 into this country, their power to adjudicate cases in\n\n21 this fashion was understood to be an element of their\n\n22 sovereignty.

plaintiff here is a citizen of the\n\n7 State of Mississippi.\n\nMississippi\u0027s tort ­­ State tort\n\n8 law does apply to the case.

GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it\u0027s\n\n18 true that this Court\u0027s decisions can often be resolved\n\n19 in different ways. What Nevada v. Hicks in the footnote\n\n20 addressing this question explains is that what the Court\n\n21 has done is narrowly identify the legislative\n\n22 jurisdiction of the Tribe in the cases before it.

GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, what the\n\n10 Court has said in Nevada v.

And we assume that that\u0027s one of the\n\n16 reasons the Court granted review in this case. To\n\n17 decide, assuming that there is legislative jurisdiction,\n\n18 whether there also is adjudicatory jurisdiction.\n\n19 And I\u0027m pleased to explain why it is. And\n\n20 what I ­­ my introduction was trying to do was, assuming\n\n21 the antecedent legislative jurisdiction, here\u0027s why you\n\n22 don\u0027t have jurisdiction to decide a court case in this\n\n23 fashion.\n\n24 So the first one that I gave you was the\n\n25 availability of a neutral forum as anticipated by the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                           \n\n                     \n\n                \n\n                   \n\n                  \n\n   \n\n                        \n\n \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n   \n\n                         \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                           \n\n10\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Constitution.\n\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I address that for a\n\n3 moment?\n\n4 States appoint judges. Sometimes they\u0027re\n\n5 elected, but often they\u0027re appointed. We don\u0027t think it\n\n6 lacks being a neutral forum because the State can sue a\n\n7 citizen there. We think of it as neutral because the\n\n8 judges are neutral.\n\n9 You\u0027re just assuming that these judges are\n\n10 not neutral.\n\n11 MR.

And the point I was trying to make is that our\n\n15 legal tradition understands that there will be certain\n\n16 basic protections.\n\n17 And remember, two of the things I\u0027m\n\n18 identifying in the Constitution are not specific to the\n\n19 States: The supremacy of the Constitution ­­ but the\n\n20 Constitution does not apply in tribal courts ­­ and also\n\n21 the supremacy of this Court as the one Supreme Court,\n\n22 which is not available.\n\n23 Now, Justice Scalia, those are features of\n\n24 our national legal tradition, and those features existed\n\n25 at the time of incorporation of the Tribes into the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                  \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                        \n\n                     \n\n                   \n\n                          \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n                        \n\n              \n\n \n\n                            \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n                 \n\n                \n\n            \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                            \n\nOfficial\n\n14\n\n1 United States. And my point is that Congress could not\n\n2 have believed that, if State courts couldn\u0027t do these\n\n3 things, that the tribal courts would be superior.\n\n4 Now, Justice Breyer, you said, well, what\u0027s\n\n5 wrong? Two things. I want to say that there are some\n\n6 things wrong even in the context of a tribe like this\n\n7 one.\n\n8 For example, we have a Federal claim against\n\n9 the due process ­­ a due process claim against the\n\n10 putative damage award in ­­ that\u0027s asked for in this\n\n11 case, and that would be entirely unreviewable in this\n\n12 case.\n\n13 Now, you contemplate the prospect that we\n\n14 would collaterally attack the judgment.

Now, you contemplate the prospect that we\n\n14 would collaterally attack the judgment.\n\nA few things\n\n15 about that.\n\n16 The first is, if that\u0027s going to be serious,\n\n17 if we are really going to have a serious regime of\n\n18 collateral attacks where you would just assess whether\n\n19 or not the tribal court ruling is consistent with due\n\n20 process. That is hardly treating the tribal courts as\n\n21 sovereigns. Imagine a Federal district court ruling\n\n22 could be overturned by a circuit court in Mississippi.\n\n23 We wouldn\u0027t say that that was an actual sovereign\n\n24 ruling.\n\n25 And the second is that that review system is\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n              \n\n                 \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                     \n\n               \n\n                      \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                     \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                    \n\n             \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n                 \n\nOfficial\n\n15\n\n1 extremely rare.

My\n\n7 point is that the rule that\u0027s contemplated by the\n\n8 Constitution is not one of being way out of bounds, it\n\n9 is simply that we have a right to due process; that this\n\n10 Court will be the Supreme Court, that the Constitution\n\n11 is the supreme law of the land.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn\u0027t the Indian\n\n16 Civil Rights Act ­­ I mean, it\u0027s not the Bill of Rights,\n\n17 but Indian Civil Rights Act is pretty close.\n\n18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the\n\n19 rule of the Constitution is not \"close is good enough,\"\n\n20 but I will say that I think the Indian Civil Rights Act\n\n21 is a point in our favor. Because when you talk about\n\n22 the regulatory matters discussed in the first Montana\n\n23 exception like taxation and licensing, those are things\n\n24 that Congress has left to the Tribes. But the Indian\n\n25 Civil Rights Act, like Public Law 280, like the Courts\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n               \n\n                \n\n             \n\n            \n\n                        \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n                    \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n \n\n                           \n\n                   \n\n             \n\n             \n\n \n\n                            \n\n16\n\nOfficial\n\n1 of Indian Offenses, like the Indian deprivation system\n\n2 shows that the United States has actually been deeply\n\n3 involved in the tribal judiciary.

It\u0027s quite different.\n\n6 The United States obviously did not regard\n\n7 the Tribes\u0027 judiciary as something that is purely a part\n\n8 of their government, because time and again, it has\n\n9 micromanaged them.\n\n10 And, Justice Breyer, I do want to point out\n\n11 another example of that, and that is the Violence\n\n12 Against Women Act.

We disagree, but we\n\n19 understand the argument.\n\n20 My point is that in these circumstances,\n\n21 what the Tribes do is, as a condition of operating on\n\n22 the Reservation, they call for not just what you\n\n23 describe, which is the application of tribal law, but a\n\n24 consent to the forum.

explanation is that tort law of the Tribe tracks\n\n14 Mississippi tort law, and there isn\u0027t a situation in\n\n15 which the Tribe could bring such an action.

We\n\n21 believe that if the Tribe went into tribal court to\n\n22 enforce those measures, that would be a sovereign action\n\n23 and it would be susceptible of the Montana exception.\n\n24 The difference is when the Tribe is not a\n\n25 party here.

One is that they themselves,\n\n13 that nonmember, is consenting to that by going to ­­\n\n14 like the store here, setting up shop and running the\n\n15 Tribal Opportunities Program and serving its members.\n\n16 And number two, the big difference is that\n\n17 Congress has full control over there.

made about, specifically in connection with\n\n5 the diversity point, which Mr. Katyal has responded to,\n\n6 but the argument that the policies of the deferred city\n\n7 statute, such as concerns about perhaps competence of\n\n8 tribal courts or bias, that they should at least inform\n\n9 the analysis. And the Court said that would be\n\n10 inconsistent ­­ and this is before the 1993 statute ­­\n\n11 that would be inconsistent with Congress\u0027s judgment\n\n12 about encouraging tribal courts as an important\n\n13 expression of tribal sovereignty.\n\n14 And then Congress comes along and provides\n\n15 funding and training, statutes that ­­ that provide for\n\n16 training of tribal judges, money to support the payment\n\n17 of tribal judges and to support tribes in publication of\n\n18 their tribal codes. Congress thoroughly examined this\n\n19 and then again in the year 2000 enacted a statute with a\n\n20 similar finding.\n\n21 So what we have here is not congressional\n\n22 silence but congressional approval of that, here in\n\n23 particular.\n\n24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, I don\u0027t\n\n25 know that you\u0027ve answered ­­ I\u0027m going to assume\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                    \n\n               \n\n                     \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n \n\n                         \n\n     \n\n                 \n\n                 \n\n                     \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n             \n\n                       \n\n \n\n                       \n\n                         \n\n               \n\n                             \n\n   \n\n                         \n\n                          \n\nOfficial\n\n53","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"49","file_name":"Dollar General Corp. v.

And we have cases like Regal, we have\n\n22 the preemption context in which the Court has said\n\n23 something like that.

What would remain is the difference of\n\n12 adjudication from the substance of the tort law.\n\n13 The second point, as Justice Scalia, I will\n\n14 line up my friend\u0027s committee reports against the text\n\n15 of the Constitution. We do not have an answer to the\n\n16 fact that our constitutional tradition has three points\n\n17 in it that are inconsistent with this form of\n\n18 adjudication. And two of them are not specific to the\n\n19 States.\n\n20 The Constitution is the supreme law of the\n\n21 land in the United States. This Court is the Supreme\n\n22 Court of the United States. That\u0027s not true just with\n\n23 respect to the States, that is a bedrock ­­ those are\n\n24 bedrock principles.

It is historically implausible to believe\n\n9 that in all three of these respects, when the tribes\n\n10 came into the United States, they were in a superior\n\n11 position to the States.

And it cannot be, then,\n\n16 that it thought the tribal courts were better than the\n\n17 State courts.\n\n18 And it does relate, Mr. Chief Justice, to\n\n19 your point that the Court has never held, despite\n\n20 dictum, that a nonmember is subject to adjudication in a\n\n21 tribal court. Because if you haven\u0027t done it till now,\n\n22 it is, I think, respectfully implausible to believe that\n\n23 Congress thought it was true in 1880, at a time when the\n\n24 tribes had much less developed legal systems.\n\n25 My final point is ­­ relates to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n            \n\n                  \n\n                \n\n         \n\n                      \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n   \n\n                             \n\n               \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n               \n\n              \n\n                         \n\n                \n\n                    \n\n                    \n\n                  \n\n              \n\n62\n\nOfficial\n\n1 administrability.
