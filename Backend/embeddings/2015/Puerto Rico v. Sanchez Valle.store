That means that\n\n14 a prior Federal conviction has no Double Jeopardy\n\n15 implications for the enforcement of the Commonwealth\u0027s\n\n16 criminal laws because Commonwealth law and Federal law\n\n17 emanate from different sources of authority: The people\n\n18 of Puerto Rico on the one hand and Congress on the\n\n19 other.\n\n20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Landau, could\n\n21 Congress amend 48 U.S.C. 1704, which covers Guam, the\n\n22 Virgin Islands, American Samoa? Could it amend that\n\n23 statute and put Puerto Rico in there as well?\n\n24 MR.

So that goes to the first part of\n\n13 your question.\n\n14 To the second part of your question, it is\n\n15 Congress acting in tandem with the people of Puerto Rico\n\n16 that\u0027s critical. In other words, it is certainly not\n\n17 the people of Puerto Rico that could unilaterally and\n\n18 without reference to Congress just say, guess what? We\n\n19 are the source of authority of our own laws.

the\n\n22 reason that the Court has said that it\u0027s looked to that\n\n23 ultimate source is because the dual sovereignty doctrine\n\n24 rests on the basic structure of our Federal system.\n\n25

And the Court said should they have this\n\n10 power to dual prosecute? Well, we look to the\n\n11 Constitution, and the unique structure that was put in\n\n12 place: The splitting the atom of sovereignty. And we\n\n13 are in a circumstance where both the States and the\n\n14 Federal government have this sovereign power. They\n\n15 should both be able to prosecute.\n\n16 But then the case ­­ the Court turned to\n\n17 cases about the territories, which was the Shell case\n\n18 about Puerto Rico, but then also the Grafton case about\n\n19 the Philippines, and it said, no, the territories derive\n\n20 their ultimate power from Congress. That\u0027s true by\n\n21 virtue of the Territory Clause.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"42","file_name":"Puerto Rico v.

But asking the constitutional question,\n\n19 which is what the Court has asked in its double jeopardy\n\n20 cases, about whether Congress could revise the\n\n21 arrangement with Puerto Rico, the answer is yes. And we\n\n22 think that that follows from its status as a United\n\n23 States territory because of two parts of the Territory\n\n24 Clause.\n\n25 The first is that territories belong to the\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n             \n\n       \n\n                          \n\n     \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n           \n\n                          \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n                       \n\n \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n     \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n                \n\n51\n\nOfficial ­ Subject to Final Review\n\n1 United States, meaning that they are under the\n\n2 sovereignty of the United States.\n\n3 And then second, that Congress is the one\n\n4 who makes the rules.\n\n5 And if I could just make one more point,\n\n6 which is historically, the fact that Congress was ­­\n\n7 that the United States was the sovereign and the only\n\n8 sovereign in the territories was very important at the\n\n9 time that the Constitution was put together.\n\n10 You may recall that the United States had\n\n11 land there through the Northwest Ordinance, but it was\n\n12 trying to figure out what to do with, and there were\n\n13 questions with the States, what would happen. And so\n\n14 that this provision needed to be added to the\n\n15 Constitution to make clear that Congress was the one who\n\n16 was going to make rules for the territories, and that it\n\n17 would be under the sovereignty of the United States.\n\n18 JUSTICE BREYER: But there are some\n\n19 things ­­\n\n20 MR.
