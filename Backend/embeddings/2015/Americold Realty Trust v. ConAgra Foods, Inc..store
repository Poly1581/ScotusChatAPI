We believe a bright­line rule is appropriate\n\n17 in this case, that in a lawsuit involving a trust, just\n\n18 as with a trustee, the trustee should be the party of\n\n19 interest. And we should compare it to the ­­\n\n20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should we get to that\n\n21 question if, when this case began, even if you looked\n\n22 only to the citizenship of the trustees, there was no\n\n23 complete diversity?\n\n24 MR.

POSPISIL: Your Honor, it\u0027s more ­­ it\u0027s\n\n13 like a trust because there are two attributes that a\n\n14 trust have, that have historically had. There is a\n\n15 separation between legal ownership, and beneficial or\n\n16 equitable ownership.

When a\n\n16 partnership ­­ before they could sue or be sued in their\n\n17 own name, a partnership always had to have ­­ the\n\n18 members of that partnership had to bring the cause of\n\n19 action.\n\n20 Now let\u0027s look at the common law for a trust\n\n21 before a trust could be sued or sue in its own name.

DUGGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think it\u0027s\n\n20 important to understand that there is a very significant\n\n21 distinction between a shareholder of a REIT and a\n\n22 beneficiary of a common law traditional trust.\n\n23 As set forth in the appendix to the\n\n24 petition, page 79, which is the Declaration of Trust for\n\n25 Americold, the actual shareholders have personal\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                  \n\n                 \n\n             \n\n           \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                      \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n             \n\n               \n\n                        \n\n                 \n\n               \n\n   \n\n                        \n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                        \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n           \n\n23\n\nOfficial\n\n1 property interest in the shares.

Here the shareholder members, as we describe\n\n15 them, only have an interest in the personal property of\n\n16 a certificate of ownership, very much like the limited\n\n17 partners in Carden.\n\n18 In Carden the limited partners didn\u0027t have\n\n19 an ownership interest in the assets of the entity. It\n\n20 had a certificate of ownership as a limited partner.\n\n21 In those two instances, Mr. Chief Justice,\n\n22 this limited partner in Carden and the trustee member,\n\n23 or the beneficiary member in this case, are virtually\n\n24 identical.

should remain in play as announced by this Court but\n\n17 with the limited exception of class action lawsuits.\n\n18 So if the court took a wrong turn in Carden,\n\n19 Congress has affirmed it only

You go beyond that and\n\n6 look to the citizenship of the members.\n\n7 I mean, that seems odd. Why do you look to\n\n8 the members or the shareholders, or the ­­ or the\n\n9 beneficiaries where you sue the trust itself but you\n\n10 don\u0027t in the identical situation where the law of the\n\n11 State allows you to sue the trustees?

MR.\n\nDUGGAN: But it is the sport that\u0027s\n\n14 played even with regard to limited partnerships,\n\n15 Justice Breyer, because in the instance where in a\n\n16 limited partnership a general partner who is managing\n\n17 the affairs of the entity breaches a duty to a third\n\n18 party and the entity itself also is responsible for a\n\n19 breach of duty, a party can sue both the general partner\n\n20 and the artificial entity. And if the general partner\n\n21 happens to be an individual, you measure by his natural\n\n22 citizenship and you measure the entity by virtue of who\n\n23 the members are.\n\n24 And people make tactical reasons every day\n\n25 in the United States about who to sue and who not to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n                  \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n                      \n\n               \n\n         \n\n                        \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n         \n\n                \n\n                 \n\n                   \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n       \n\n                            \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n                       \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\n1 sue. In some instances, they may choose to sue the\n\n2 general partner because they want to get into Federal\n\n3 court and they don\u0027t want to sue the entity, but they\u0027ll\n\n4 take their risks on suing only one of the parties that\u0027s\n\n5 liable, or they may sue all of them. But they have to\n\n6 satisfy the rules applicable to each one of those\n\n7 particular parties that may be responsible.\n\n8 I think the other thing that\u0027s important\n\n9 here is that the ­­ the argument suggested by the\n\n10 Petitioner is that we look to the control test, a test\n\n11 of those persons that are in control, and this Court has\n\n12 implicitly and expressly rejected that test.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2015","index":"28","file_name":"Americold Realty Trust v.

from that vantage\n\n13 point, common law trust entities have never been\n\n14 recognized as entity status with capacity to sue and be\n\n15 sued as an entity. The trustees who are the legal\n\n16 nominal owners of the assets bring the claim. That\u0027s a\n\n17 significant distinction. But just as importantly, the\n\n18 beneficiary shareholders of a REIT have no equitable\n\n19 interest in the assets of the artificial entity because\n\n20 the very Trust declaration itself provides it\u0027s merely\n\n21 personal property. They are so much like the limited\n\n22 partners in Carden that it\u0027s striking.\n\n23 But just as importantly, I think, back to\n\n24 the point I was making, the Court expressly rejected the\n\n25 control test in Carden and said, quote, \"real persons to\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n           \n\n               \n\n                 \n\n                  \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                            \n\n               \n\n                   \n\n               \n\n               \n\n                          \n\n   \n\n                        \n\n                  \n\n                  \n\n         \n\n             \n\n                  \n\n             \n\n               \n\n \n\n                           \n\n                  \n\n33\n\nOfficial\n\n1 controversy test\" and, quote, \"which parties have\n\n2 control over the subject of the litigation\" have never\n\n3 guided our reasoning with regard to who are the citizens\n\n4 of an artificial entity.
