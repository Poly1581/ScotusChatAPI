KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn enacting RFRA, Congress did not\n\nsubject federal employees throughout the\n\ngovernment to a new cause of action for damages\n\nin their personal capacity.\n\nRFRA\u0027s remedy section provides only\n\nfor appropriate relief against the government.\n\nDamages against an individual employee in his\n\npersonal capacity are not relief against the\n\ngovernment.\n\nAt the same time, where a suit is\n\nbrought against the federal government,\n\nincluding against a federal official in his\n\nofficial capacity, as RFRA provides for, money\n\ndamages are not appropriate relief.\n\nPrior to this Court\u0027s decision in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nSmith and the passage of RFRA, injunctive relief\n\nagainst a federal agency or official was the\n\nonly appropriate relief for an asserted free\n\nexercise violation.  This Court had not\n\nrecognized a personal damages action under\n\nBivens for a violation of the Free Exercise\n\nClause, and it has not done so since.\n\nMoreover, prior to RFRA, Congress had\n\nenacted the Westfall Act, which adopted a broad\n\nbar to tort suits against federal employees to\n\nprevent the chilling effects for the executive\n\nbranch from the prospect of personal liability\n\nand protracted litigation for its employees.\n\nCongress has only very rarely departed from that","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Tanzin v.

KASSEM: Well, Your Honor, that\n\nis, of course, an argument among the very many\n\narguments that Petitioners could have presented\n\nin the motion to dismiss qualified immunity --\n\nthe qualified immunity defense that they made at\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n37\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthe motion to dismiss stage, as Justice Alito\n\nsaid.\n\nThey actually did present that\n\ndefense. And they would be able to argue not\n\nonly that there was no burden, that the burden\n\nwas insubstantial, they\u0027d be able to argue that\n\nthere was a compelling government interest, and\n\nthey\u0027d be able to say that whatever they did was\n\nthe least restrictive means, and had Petitioners\n\naccepted remand from the Second Circuit to the\n\ndistrict court, those are precisely the\n\nquestions that would have been adjudicated on\n\nremand.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"32","file_name":"Tanzin v.

KASSEM: Well, Your Honor, a\n\ndistrict court judge would be, of course, free\n\non the facts of a given case to make a\n\ndetermination that damages are not particularly\n\nsuitable, which is the meaning of \"appropriate,\"\n\nor to decide that compensatory damages but not\n\npunitive damages would be appropriate.  But that\n\nwould be on a case-by-case and not a categorical\n\nbasis.\n\nThere is no categorical basis to\n\njudicially exclude damages under this statute.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"36","file_name":"Tanzin v.
