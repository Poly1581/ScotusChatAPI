any employee who used a Zoom account\n\nover Thanksgiving to connect with distant\n\nrelatives would be subject to the grace of\n\nfederal prosecutors.\n\nThe main argument the government\n\noffers in response to that startling result is\n\nthat a single two-letter word in the CFAA\u0027s\n\ndefinition of \"exceeds authorized access,\" the\n\nterm \"so,\" demands it.\n\nHeritage Reporting

It relieves\n\nthe government of having to negate every\n\npossible alternative means by which the\n\ndefendant might permissibly have obtained the\n\ninformation at issue.\n\nBut that is all the word does.  It\n\ndoes not transform the CFAA into a sweeping\n\nInternet police mandate.  The Court should\n\nreverse.\n\nAnd I\u0027m happy to take any questions.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, in\n\nMusacchio versus United States, this is what we\n\nsaid: That statute provides two ways of\n\ncommitting the crime of improperly accessing a\n\nprotected computer:  obtaining access without\n\nauthorization and obtaining access with\n\nauthorization but then using that access\n\nimproperly.\n\nYou didn\u0027t mention that case in your\n\nopening brief.  The government relied on it.\n\nYou didn\u0027t mention it in your reply brief.

And we know from other\n\nenactments that we\u0027ve cited, for example, at\n\npage 19 of our blue brief, that when Congress\n\nwants to criminalize or otherwise prohibit\n\nimproper use or unauthorized purposes, it does\n\nso expressly.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to make\n\nsure I have your interpretation correct, if --\n\nif a -- if a bank has a policy barring employees\n\nfrom accessing Facebook, and an employee exceeds\n\nher authorized access and would be covered if\n\nshe goes onto Facebook, but it wouldn\u0027t be a\n\nviolation if she used that access to look up\n\ncustomers\u0027 Social Security numbers to sell them\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"5","file_name":"Van Buren v.

Justice Thomas, not in\n\nthe Eleventh Circuit, but the papers discuss,\n\nfor example, the Drew case out of the Ninth\n\nCircuit, which was issue -- which was before the\n\nNinth Circuit issued the Nosal decision, where\n\nsomebody was prosecuted for misusing MySpace.\n\nThere\u0027s a case involving Ticketmaster that we\u0027ve\n\ncited in the brief.\n\nBut, more generally, Justice Thomas,\n\nI\u0027d also point you to two other things.  One is\n\nremember that the language of this statute has\n\nits own deterrent effect.  And so, for people\n\nwho use the Internet every day, they have to be\n\naware of the criminal law, both on the criminal\n\nside and, remember, this statute has a civil\n\ncomponent.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s the -- the critical\n\nthing, is that the Court said in Marinello and\n\nmany other cases that you can\u0027t construe a\n\nstatute simply on the assumption the government\n\nwill use it responsibly. So, if the government\n\nhas withheld the full brunt of the federal\n\nprosecutorial power, that doesn\u0027t enable the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n10\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nCourt to simply construe the statute on that\n\npromise.\n\nAnd so I think that\u0027s the -- that\u0027s\n\nthe critical problem with the government\u0027s point\n\nhere.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"7","file_name":"Van Buren v.

FISHER: Well, two things, Justice\n\nBreyer.  Remember, first of all, that that\n\noriginal provision of the statute was\n\nexceedingly narrow.  It applied just to certain\n\nfederal employees and certain information.\n\nWhen Congress changed that law two\n\nyears later in 1986, you\u0027re right that at one\n\npoint of the committee report it talked about\n\nsimply clarifying the statute, but in the other\n\npart of the committee report, dealing with\n\nexactly the same words, what the -- what the --\n\nwhat Congress said is that they had removed one\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n13\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nof the murkier grounds for -- for liability and\n\nrefocused the statute on its principal object.\n\nAnd so you have those cross-cutting\n\npieces of legislative history.  And even the\n\ngovernment, I would stress, does not argue that\n\nall that amendment did is clarify.  The\n\ngovernment says that that amendment actually\n\ndramatically expanded the statute to go even\n\nbeyond improper purposes to a violation of any\n\nstated use restriction.\n\nSo nobody here is arguing that the\n\nstatute didn\u0027t change in 1986.

I want to follow up on Justice\n\nKavanaugh\u0027s question.  The interpretation that\n\nhe offered to you of that language, \"accesses a\n\ncomputer without authorization or exceeds\n\nauthorized access,\" is similar to the kind of\n\non/off switch that I was describing to Mr.\n\nFisher since you\u0027re either authorized to be\n\nthere or you\u0027re not, and it doesn\u0027t really take\n\ninto account questions of scope.\n\nYou say that \"so\" is what really makes\n\nyour argument.  So are you saying that there\n\nisn\u0027t any kind of inherent idea of a scope of\n\nauthorization simply in the word \"authorize\"\n\nitself?\n\nMR. FEIGIN: There -- there is\n\ninherent in the word \"authorized\" the scope of\n\nauthorization, Your Honor.  I -- I think that is\n\n-- the access is the authorized access, and then\n\nyou\u0027re using the access in -- in a manner you\u0027re\n\nnot -- you\u0027re not permitted so -- so to use it.\n\nSo you are exceeding a limit on your\n\nauthorization.
