a.m.)\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\n\nargument next in Case 20-440, Minerva Surgical,\n\nIncorporated versus Hologic, Incorporated.\n\nMr. Hochman.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. HOCHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Patent Act doesn\u0027t provide for\n\nassignor estoppel and never has. In fact, it\n\nsays invalidity shall be a defense in any\n\naction.  That\u0027s essential to the fundamental\n\npatent market.  The public grants exclusive\n\nrights but only to the extent inventors publicly\n\nshare useful advances in knowledge.  Accused\n\ninfringers who prove a patent is invalid\n\nvindicate the right of all to make and use and\n\nsell unpatented project -- products.\n\nHologic says Congress didn\u0027t have to\n\nwrite assignor estoppel into the Patent Act.  It\n\nreads this Court\u0027s 1924 decision in Formica as\n\nhaving settled assignor estoppel into patent\n\nlaw. We don\u0027t think that\u0027s what Formica did,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nbut it doesn\u0027t matter because the world didn\u0027t\n\nstop in 1924.\n\nIn 1945, this Court allowed an\n\nassignor to invalidate a patent in Scott Paper.\n\nThat\u0027s squarely contrary to assignor estoppel.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Minerva Surgical, Inc. v.

And this\n\nCourt in Westinghouse specifically said, look,\n\nthat\u0027s estoppel by conduct, that\u0027s not estoppel\n\nby deed.

But\n\npatent laws have other critical objectives,\n\nincluding incentivizing scientific progress\n\nthrough the protection of patents and fostering\n\npredictability in commercial transactions.\n\nHologic respectfully submits that, if\n\nthe costs and benefits of assignor estoppel are\n\nto be reweighed, it should be Congress handling","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"57","file_name":"Minerva Surgical, Inc. v.

The\n\nparties valued those rights based on the\n\nunderstanding that Respondent would secure\n\nwhatever claims the Patent Office would allow,\n\nin this case, a claim just like the one that Mr.\n\nTruckai successfully secured allowance of with\n\noriginal Claim 31, and that Mr. Truckai would\n\nnot subsequently challenge their validity.\n\nAnd if Mr. Truckai wanted a different\n\ndeal, he was free to contract around assignor\n\nestoppel, per Mentor Graphics, and accept a\n\nconcomitantly reduced purchase price. But Mr.\n\nTruckai now wants to keep both the $8 million he\n\npocketed and the right to undermine what those\n\nmillions purchased.\n\nThe inequity of that position has been\n\napparent since the founding of this country, and\n\nthe doctrine of assignor estoppel borne from\n\nthat recognition should not be cast aside.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Wolf, you\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"58","file_name":"Minerva Surgical, Inc. v.
