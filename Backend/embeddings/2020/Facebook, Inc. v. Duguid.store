CLEMENT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe TCPA defines an Automatic\n\nTelephone Dialing System as equipment with the\n\ncapacity to store or produce telephone numbers\n\nto be called, using a random or sequential\n\nnumber generator, and to dial such number.  The\n\nstatute prohibits calls using an ATDS to\n\nemergency and cellular lines but not to\n\nresidential lines.\n\nUnder well-established rules of\n\ngrammar and statutory construction, the entire\n\nphrase \"telephone numbers to be called, using a\n\nrandom or sequential number generator\" applies\n\nto both disjunctive verbs, \"store\" or \"produce.\"\n\nThe contrary reading covers any device that can\n\nstore and dial numbers even without the use of a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nrandom or sequential number generator.  That\n\nreading creates a statute of impossible breadth\n\nand a fundamental mismatch between the ATDS\n\ndefinition and the targeted ATDS prohibitions.\n\nUnder ordinary rules of grammar, a\n\nrestrictive modifier that follows two\n\ndisjunctive verbs modifies both, not just the\n\nsecond one. Three features of the statutory\n\ntext here reinforce that conclusion.\n\nFirst, the punctuation.  The modified\n\nphrase here is set off by a comma, which\n\nindicates that the phrase modifies both verbs.\n\nSecond, the shared direct object.

Well, Justice Thomas, I\n\nactually think that\u0027s an excellent question, and\n\nI think it is another way in which the courts\n\nhave essentially updated the statute to keep up\n\nwith the times.\n\nAnd it\u0027s not at all clear that a\n\nstatute that was directed not just at calls but\n\nalso, in particular, at artificial or\n\nprerecorded voice calls is really sensibly\n\napplied to

to, Justice Thomas, is there is an amicus\n\nbrief by the Washington Legal Foundation that\n\naddresses this issue specifically, and what they\n\npoint out is that in more recent statutes, when\n\nCongress is -- when Congress addresses calls and\n\ntexts, they do so either conjunctively or\n\ndisjunctively.  But I think that gives real\n\nevidence to the fact that one doesn\u0027t naturally\n\ntalk about a text as a call, but, rather, one\n\ntalks about either calls I received on my phone\n\nor texts I received.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  The -- the -- when\n\nyou -- when we talk about a number generator","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"6","file_name":"Facebook, Inc. v.

syntax,\n\nusage, or interpretation.  And the way they do\n\nthat is to ask, what makes sense?\n\nI can give you lots of examples, but I\n\nhave very little time for questioning, so they\n\n-- they ask about the sense of it before they\n\nget to all this arcane stuff.\n\nSo the question that jumps out here is\n\nthis: Does it make any sense to speak about\n\nstoring a list of telephone numbers using a\n\nrandom or sequential number generator?\n\nAnd the best answer I can find in the\n\nbriefs on your side is that there were systems\n\nthat produced lists of numbers using such a\n\ngenerator and then stored them.  But, unless you\n\ncan explain how a generator was used in the very\n\nprocess of storing the numbers, I think you have\n\na problem.\n\nMR. CLEMENT: So, Justice Alito, two\n\nquick things on that.  One is I do think readers\n\nof language have an advantage over listeners,\n\nwhich is they can look to the punctuation, and I\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"10","file_name":"Facebook, Inc. v.

It does not put an elephant\n\nhole next to a mouse hole, prohibiting both\n\neverything under the sun and a highly\n\nspecialized practice.\n\nAnd that points to the second problem.\n\nIf Congress really wanted to prohibit every\n\nannoying call made with a device that can store\n\nand dial numbers, it would not have left the\n\nhome front unprotected.

Thank\n\nyou, counsel.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Ellis, at the time\n\nthe TCPA was enacted, there were a fair number\n\nof state statutes that dealt with the same\n\ngeneral subject matter area, and every single\n\none of those statutes defined an autodialer to\n\nencompass at least some machines that didn\u0027t use\n\na random or sequential number generator.\n\nSo doesn\u0027t that suggest that your\n\ndefinition is wrong?  I mean, would Congress\n\nreally have wanted to depart from all of those\n\nstate statutes in this particular way?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"33","file_name":"Facebook, Inc. v.

I think what it\n\nsuggests is that Congress approached the similar\n\n-- the same problem in a different way.\n\nAnd so it\u0027s true that all or almost\n\nall the state statutes included devices beyond\n\nthose that use random or sequential number\n\ngenerators, but it\u0027s also true that almost every\n\nstate, I think all but two, limited -- only\n\naddressed devices that delivered a prerecorded\n\nvoice and then regulated those devices.\n\nCongress came at that same problem in\n\na different way by first prohibiting all\n\nprerecorded voice calls to residential lines and\n\nto the sensitive lines, regardless of the\n\ntechnology -- dialing technology, and then\n\nseparately prohibiting a -- a subset of the --\n\nof -- of calls made with an ATDS using a random\n\nor sequential number generator.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u0027s a similar\n\napproach.  Indeed, Congress\u0027s approach is\n\nsomewhat broader.  It\u0027s just a different\n\napproach.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  And --\n\nMR.
