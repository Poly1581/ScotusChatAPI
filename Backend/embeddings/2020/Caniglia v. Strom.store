DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Fourth Amendment recognizes the\n\nsanctity of the home by drawing a firm line at\n\nthe door.  The government cannot cross that line\n\nwithout a warrant, unless there is consent or\n\nexigent circumstances.\n\nHere, there was neither.  Respondents\u0027\n\nwarrantless seizure of Petitioner from his home\n\nand their subsequent seizures of his lawfully\n\npossessed guns from his bedroom and garage\n\nviolated the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe First Circuit tried to get around\n\nthe warrant requirement by creating a new\n\nexception based on Cady.  But Cady involved the\n\nstandardized search of a car in police custody.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t grant a license for intruding the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nhome.

the opposite, nearly every page of\n\nthe Court\u0027s decision relies on the\n\nconstitutional differences between cars and\n\nhouses.\n\nRespondents and the United States take\n\na different tack.  They claim that the warrant\n\nrequirement isn\u0027t even implicated when officers\n\nact for non-investigatory reasons.\n\nBut, in case after case, the Court has\n\nconsistently applied the warrant requirement to\n\nhomes, regardless of the government\u0027s purpose,\n\nincluding when public health or safety is at\n\nstake.\n\nMoreover, the line between\n\ninvestigatory and non-investigatory actions is\n\nhardly clear.  Nearly every criminal violation\n\nhas public safety implications, so dispensing\n\nwith the warrant requirement whenever police can\n\npoint to a health or safety motive would\n\neviscerate the Fourth Amendment.\n\nFinally, there\u0027s no good reason to\n\ncreate the sweeping new rule that Respondents\n\nask for.

Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nSotomayor.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I\u0027d be\n\nhard pressed to think that any judge would not\n\nconsider the hypothetical pressed by the Chief\n\nJustice as justifying a -- a knock and entry by\n\npolice officers.\n\nYou have a neighbor who expects an\n\nelderly woman to come visit, a known tipster who\n\ncomes and tells the police she\u0027s never late, and\n\nit\u0027s now -- she\u0027s really late and there\u0027s no\n\nanswer.\n\nI don\u0027t see how, under any\n\ncircumstance, either the emergency aid or\n\nemergency doctrine, exigent circumstance\n\ndoctrine wouldn\u0027t permit that search.  I -- I --\n\nI\u0027m -- if that\u0027s the case, then maybe Justice\n\nBreyer is right, but, if I disagree with him and\n\nbelieve that both the emergency aid doctrine and\n\nthe exigent circumstance doctrine would permit\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n24\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nmost entries that -- where there is reasonable\n\ncause to believe that someone might be in need,\n\nwhat does that do to your argument?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"20","file_name":"Caniglia v.

And, here, you don\u0027t have\n\njust a statement that might have been hyperbole.\n\nYou have that statement coupled with the\n\nproduction of a live firearm, a statement that\u0027s\n\nso scared, the individual who presumably knows\n\nthat person best, that she packed a bag, hid the\n\nmagazine for the gun, left for the night and\n\ncalled the police the next morning.\n\nAnd then you have confirmation by the\n\nperson who made the statement that he did say\n\nit, but he was sick of the fights and so on and\n\nso on. And -- and so I -- I do think courts are\n\nperfectly capable of drawing the line between\n\nthose two scenarios.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"74","file_name":"Caniglia v.

That\u0027s the language of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.\n\nAnd it seems to me that I don\u0027t have a\n\nproblem with them having removed this gentleman\n\nand taken him to the hospital.  That\u0027s a\n\nseizure, because they had reason to believe that\n\nhe was threatening suicide.\n\nAnd even though 12 hours had passed,\n\nthe wife was still concerned, and he admitted to\n\nthe threat by calling it a joke. I don\u0027t think\n\npolice officers have to take his description at\n\nface value given the circumstances described.\n\nSo seizing him and taking him to the\n\nhome would seem to me -- to psychiatric\n\nexamination as very much an exigent\n\ncircumstance.\n\nMissing here, as I pointed out to your\n\ncolleague, is the next step, which is going into\n\nthe home without attempt to secure consent from\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"75","file_name":"Caniglia v.

DVORETZKY:  Well, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, I think, if you have a situation that\n\nisn\u0027t that exigent or that isn\u0027t an emergency,\n\nthen police shouldn\u0027t be going in.\n\nThe reason that the temporal limit on\n\nthe exigent circumstances doctrine is so\n\nimportant is that it ensures that -- that\n\nclaiming exigent circumstances doesn\u0027t just\n\nbecome a pretext for law enforcement.\n\nAnd there are a couple of cases from\n\nthe lower courts here --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, my\n\nconcern is not so much it\u0027s a pretext for law\n\nenforcement but that it\u0027s a pretext for\n\ncommunity caretaking.\n\nMR. DVORETZKY:  Well, I think, either\n\nway, the risk is that officers go in, they say\n\nit\u0027s because they\u0027re looking out for somebody\u0027s\n\ninterests, but not in an emergency situation,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"89","file_name":"Caniglia v.

Under the\n\ncommon law, the only situations where officers\n\ncould go in is where they -- either it was a hot\n\npursuit situation or they were stopping ongoing\n\nviolence.\n\nThe Restatement doesn\u0027t establish\n\notherwise. The Restatement provision says that\n\nofficers can\u0027t commit a trespass or individuals\n\ncan\u0027t commit a trespass if the person doesn\u0027t\n\nwant the help.\n\nAnd -- and the reason that there isn\u0027t\n\na common law example requiring a warrant in\n\nthese sorts of situations is because these kinds\n\nof community caretaking functions are not ones\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n108\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthat officers performed at all at common law.\n\nThe -- I -- I think the bottom line of\n\nour position here is that we\u0027re not saying that\n\npolice officers can never enter. We\u0027re just\n\nsaying they need consent, a warrant, or an\n\nemergency, an exigent circumstances situation,\n\nbut the exigent circumstances situation ought to\n\nbe defined with a tight temporal limit in order\n\nto ensure the interests protected by the Fourth\n\nAmendment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"99","file_name":"Caniglia v.
