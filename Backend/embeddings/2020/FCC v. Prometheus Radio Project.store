The parties dispute the propriety of\n\nthe Third Circuit holding onto this case and all\n\nof its various iterations for the last, I don\u0027t\n\nknow, 17 or so years.

I think we\u0027re a little\n\nskeptical that the Third Circuit\u0027s repeated\n\nstatements that it is retaining jurisdiction\n\nreally have operative legal effect.  That is, if\n\nthe next time around a petition for review is\n\nfiled in some other circuit that would otherwise\n\nbe an appropriate venue, that circuit can decide\n\nfor itself whether to transfer the case to the\n\nThird Circuit.  But we don\u0027t think that that\n\ncircuit would be under an obligation to do so\n\nsimply because the Third Circuit has included\n\nthis language about retaining its -- retaining\n\njurisdiction in its prior order.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nKavanaugh.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"15","file_name":"FCC v.

WALKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nSection 202(h) was enacted 25 years\n\nago. Since then, the ownership rules have\n\nbarely changed.  That is not what Congress had\n\nin mind.  And it took us, as I mentioned, 17\n\nyears of litigation to get to this Court.  Now\n\nthat we are here, we respectfully ask the Court\n\nto provide guidance on what the statute does and\n\ndoes not require.  Absent that guidance, we\u0027re\n\ngoing to be stuck most likely in the same morass\n\nin the very next review, and Congress\u0027s intent\n\ncould be thwarted for another 25 years.\n\nWe thus respectfully ask that you\n\nclear the way for the statute to finally operate\n\nas intended:  as a mechanism for meaningful\n\nreform, with a focus on competition that does\n\nnot allow atextual factors to trump the\n\nCommission\u0027s expressly required competitive\n\nfindings, which, again, are here completely\n\nunchallenged.\n\nFor these reasons, we ask the Court to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"38","file_name":"FCC v.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nLet me first clarify our position with\n\nrespect to the potential impact of minority and\n\nfemale ownership data on the cross-ownership\n\nrules.
