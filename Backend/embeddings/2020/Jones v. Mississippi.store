SHAPIRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nSettled law recognizes the scientific,\n\nlegal, and moral truth that most children, even\n\nthose who commit grievous crimes, are capable of\n\nredemption.  After Miller and Montgomery, there\n\nis no denying that the permanent incorrigibility\n\nrule is settled law.  Only juvenile homicide\n\noffenders who are permanently incorrigible may\n\nbe sentenced to life without parole.\n\nA paragraph in Montgomery about formal\n\nfact-finding has created confusion, but it\n\ncannot mean that no determination of permanent\n\nincorrigibility whatsoever is required because\n\nthat would obliterate the crux of the decision.\n\nAny rule of law requires deciding if the\n\ndefendant fits within the rule.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nBut Mississippi\u0027s courts have denied\n\nthe permanent incorrigibility rule itself, and\n\nthe State continues that denial in this Court.\n\nIn remanding this very case for resentencing,\n\nthe Mississippi Supreme Court did not say a word\n\nabout the permanent incorrigibility rule and\n\naffirmatively misinterpreted the law by stating","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Jones v.

not\n\njust a rule that you\u0027d have to be considered,\n\nbut, instead, a rule -- a rule -- a substantive\n\nrule that you can give an LWOP sentence only to\n\na small category of people, call them the\n\nirredeemables or the incorrigibles or what have\n\nyou.\n\nAnd the government and Mississippi\n\ncontest that understanding, and I want to get\n\nyour reaction to their arguments.  What the\n\ngovernment says is that all this talk about\n\nincorrigibles, that\u0027s just really a label for\n\nthe final judgment that a court reaches after it\n\nconsiders youth during sentencing.\n\nAnd what Mississippi says, in\n\naddition, is it says that the whole point of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n24","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"19","file_name":"Jones v.

held that mandatory juvenile\n\nlife-without-parole sentences are\n\nunconstitutional because they pose too great a\n\nrisk of disproportionate punishment.  The\n\nconstitutional flaw in such mandatory schemes is\n\nthat they make youth and all that accompanies it\n\nirrelevant.\n\nTo address that flaw, sentencers must\n\nconsider how youth and its attendant\n\ncharacteristics may diminish the penological\n\njustifications for punishment before imposing a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n41\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nlife-without-parole sentence.\n\nAfter Miller, Petitioner Jones\n\nreceived an individual life sentencing hearing\n\nwhere the sentencing court considered the\n\nmitigating circumstances of Jones\u0027s youth and\n\nits attendant characteristics before exercising\n\ndiscretion to impose a life-without-parole\n\nsentence.\n\nJones received what this Court in the\n\nEighth Amendment requires.  Jones now contends\n\nthat his sentence is still unconstitutional\n\nbecause the sentencing court did not also make a\n\nfinding that Jones is permanently incorrigible.\n\nBut that premise is wrong for three\n\nmain reasons.  Miller implicitly holds and\n\nMontgomery explicitly states that a finding of\n\nincorrigibility isn\u0027t required.  Second, the\n\nindividual life sentencing line of cases on\n\nwhich Miller relied demonstrates why Jones\u0027s\n\nposition is unavailing.  And, lastly, whether a\n\ncrime reflects permanent incorrigibility or\n\ntransient immaturity isn\u0027t a separate inquiry\n\napart from the consideration of youth.\n\nInstead, this Court has used this","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"35","file_name":"Jones v.

NOBILE: No, Your Honor.  If I\u0027m\n\nunderstanding the -- the -- the question\n\ncorrectly, that the State would have been\n\napplying Miller, it certainly changed the\n\nprocedures after Miller, because Mississippi, as\n\ndetermined by the Mississippi Supreme Court in\n\nParker versus State, said that the State had a\n\nmandatory sentencing scheme.\n\nAnd so now the State has done what\n\nMiller requires.  And, really, I think our\n\nbottom-line conclusion -- you can look at it\n\nthis way -- is that the 15 jurisdictions that\n\nMiller kind of highlights as what is\n\nconstitutional, for example, in Footnote 10,\n\nnone of them required a finding of permanent\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nincorrigibility.\n\nSo what we\u0027re saying is that the\n\nconstitutional regimes Miller said are\n\nconstitutional are, indeed, constitutional.

Did the Court say that?  I think\n\nyes, okay?  So assume I\u0027m right on that, yes,\n\nthat\u0027s a substantive rule.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"40","file_name":"Jones v.

Thank you, counsel.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nSotomayor.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --\n\ncounsel, Montgomery says repeatedly on 734 and\n\nin other places that Miller did more than\n\nrequire a sentencer to consider a juvenile\n\noffender\u0027s youth before life without parole.\n\nSo merely considering youth can\u0027t be\n\nenough under Montgomery.  It established that\n\nthe penological justification for life without\n\nparole collapsed in light of the distinct --\n\ndistinctive attributes of youth.\n\nMore than once, it says:  \"Even if a\n\ncourt considers a child\u0027s age before sentencing\n\nhim or her to a lifetime in prison, that\n\nsentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for\n\na child whose crime reflects unfortunate yet\n\ntransient immaturity.\"\n\nProportionality of sentencing looks at","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"45","file_name":"Jones v.

And by analogy, in\n\nthe death penalty context, the Gregg versus\n\nGeorgia context, we have said proportionality is\n\nrequired, but it\u0027s achieved in two ways.\n\nOne, you rule out the death penalty or\n\nlife without parole for a certain class of\n\noffenses or offenders.  And, secondly, we\n\nrequire that the sentencer consider all the\n\nrelevant mitigating and other relevant\n\ncircumstances.  That\u0027s the Lockett principle.\n\nAnd, here, I just want to make sure of\n\nyour answer.  If the -- if the process considers\n\nall the relevant circumstances, is there a\n\nseparate argument, as an Eighth Amendment\n\nmatter, that someone could still make, well,\n\nthey applied all the relevant factors, but I","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"70","file_name":"Jones v.
