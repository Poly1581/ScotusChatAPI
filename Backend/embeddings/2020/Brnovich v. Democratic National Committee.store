I\u0027d like to return to some\n\nquestions Justice Thomas touched on.\n\nWhat is the relationship between your\n\ntest focused on opportunities and the test that\n\nthe Solicitor General\u0027s brief at least suggested\n\nabout causation and the need for maybe a\n\nproximate causation test?\n\nMR. CARVIN: Yeah, I -- at the end of\n\nthe day, I don\u0027t know that there\u0027s really any\n\ndifference.  They -- they taught -- their first\n\nstep is, do minorities have the ability to vote?\n\nAnd they say that\u0027s synonymous with equal\n\nopportunity.  So I think we\u0027re on the same page\n\nthere.\n\nThey also say, if socioeconomic\n\nfactors lead to underutilization by minorities,\n\nthat\u0027s not a cognizable factor under Section 2\n\nbecause it\u0027s got to be the voting practice that\n\ncauses the diminished opportunity.  Again, we\n\nare in full-throated agreement with that\n\nprovision as well.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"25","file_name":"Brnovich v.

This is\n\nnot some mystery.  We have a long history of\n\nabout how people go about voting.  They show up\n\nat precincts and they cast a ballot.  That\n\nrequires you to leave your house, but that\u0027s not\n\nan ordinary burden of voting -- that\u0027s a usual\n\nburden of voting.\n\nWhereas the other side says, you can\n\nnever have a system which requires anybody to\n\nleave their house.  They claim that they can\u0027t\n\nfind the precincts because of socioeconomic\n\ndisparities.  They claim that they can\u0027t get to\n\nmailboxes because of socioeconomic disparities,\n\nwhich means that the state needs to allow\n\npartisan operatives to go collect the ballots.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nWell, if that\u0027s true, of course, that\n\nmeans that the only system that would satisfy\n\ntheir test is something where the government is\n\nsent house to house to collect the ballots.\n\nAnd I\u0027m just saying that that can\u0027t\n\ncome with any rational definition of the usual\n\nburdens of voting, which is you register and you","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"28","file_name":"Brnovich v.

that\n\nthere is at least a but-for cause and the\n\nstate\u0027s or the employer\u0027s policy is the but-for\n\ncause.\n\nAnd then, third, the defendant can\n\ncome back and show, well, we have a

One, as the Chief\n\nJustice pointed out, when you have the\n\nCarter-Baker Commission saying that a particular\n\nstate law is a good idea as a matter of policy,\n\nthat would seem to be a circumstance that is --\n\nas a matter of common sense, would -- would lend\n\nsupport to the state\u0027s rule.\n\nAnd then, secondly, and I mentioned\n\nthis earlier, when a state rule is commonplace\n\nin other states, that would seem to be a\n\ncircumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in\n\nfavor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it\n\nnot being a reflection of discriminatory intent.\n\nAnd, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in\n\nsomething like 26 other states, including a wide\n\nvariety of states, including states with no\n\nhistory of discrimination.\n\nSo, if we get into totality of the\n\ncircumstances, why don\u0027t those two things\n\nmatter?  And you can comment more generally on\n\nhow I\u0027ve outlined this.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"80","file_name":"Brnovich v.

However, it doesn\u0027t give a state a\n\nfree pass just by saying this is a common\n\npolicy.  Instead, you have to look at whether,\n\nin fact, the policy is justified in that state.\n\nAnd so, for example, with the out-of-precinct\n\npolicy, the state justifies it by saying that it\n\nneeds to maintain a precinct-based system.\n\nBut the reality in Arizona is that\n\n75 percent of voters in the 2020 election voted\n\nin counties that do not use a precinct-based\n\nsystem.

Sorry, I got distracted by the\n\nrun-on there.\n\nSo, Ms. Amunson, I want to ask you a\n\nquestion about the degree of, say, inconvenience\n\nversus burden, because one of the difficulties\n\nin this case is that, you know, the attorney\n\ngeneral says that the burden has to be\n\nsubstantial, Mr. Carvin\u0027s talking about the\n\nordinary burdens of voting.  And there\u0027s a\n\ndifficulty that, you know, the statutory\n\nlanguage and its lack of clarity presents in\n\ntrying to figure out when something crosses from\n\nan inconvenience to a burden.\n\nYou know, on the other side -- and I\n\nthink some of the hypotheticals that Justice\n\nAlito was asking you emphasized this -- I think,\n\nyou know, your position and its emphasis on any\n\ndisparity at all risks saying that any election\n\nrule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"82","file_name":"Brnovich v.
