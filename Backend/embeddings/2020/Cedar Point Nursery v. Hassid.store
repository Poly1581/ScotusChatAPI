case authorizes an easement on the property of\n\n20    Petitioners for the benefit of union organizers.\n\n21    Under the terms of the Access Regulation,\n\n22    organizers may occupy the

It\u0027s really not\n\n13    about whether property has been taken.  It\u0027s\n\n14    about whether that\u0027s reflective of the\n\n15    government\u0027s intent to occupy or take, which is\n\n16    why that language in Portsmouth Harbor talks\n\n17    about if the intent behind a single shot was to\n\n18    assert control over the property, then the\n\n19    taking would be complete and that there\u0027s no\n\n20    question about the intent here because it was\n\n21    accomplished by regulation.

The Ninth Circuit would draw that\n\n5    line at 24/7, 365-day occupations.  The Board\n\n6    rejects that line in explaining that a daylight\n\n7    easement would be a per se physical taking but\n\n8    offers no alternative.  Petitioners\u0027 proposal\n\n9    squares with the Federal Circuit and is at least\n\n10    hinted at, if not explicitly endorsed, by this\n\n11    Court\u0027s decision in Portsmouth Harbor.\n\n12              The Court ought to explicitly endorse\n\n13    that line today.  It gives due respect to the\n\n14    fundamental right to exclude that is at the\n\n15    heart of the Fifth Amendment.  If the access\n\n16    easement taken by the Board is so valuable to\n\n17    it, it can simply pay the businesses the value\n\n18    of that easement.\n\n19              The decision of the Ninth Circuit\n\n20    should be reversed.\n\n21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,\n\n22    counsel.\n\n23              General Mongan.\n\n24\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"32","file_name":"Cedar Point Nursery v.

MONGAN:  Well, if I could just say\n\n14    briefly, Your Honor, the Court has made very\n\n15    clear that if there is a substantial physical\n\n16    intrusion, that factor can predominate.  And in\n\n17    Kaiser Aetna, it applied Penn Central to a\n\n18    reg -- an action that involved a substantial\n\n19    physical intrusion and found a taking on that\n\n20    basis primarily without looking closely at\n\n21    diminution in value.\n\n22              And I think, if there\u0027s concern about\n\n23    how lower courts apply that ad hoc framework to\n\n24    Access Regulations, the answer would be to grant\n\n25    review in a case that actually presents a Penn\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n56\n\n1    Central challenge to an Access Regulation, not\n\n2    to adopt a -- a very broad per se rule that\n\n3    would swallow up a lot of other types of Access\n\n4    Regulations.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"49","file_name":"Cedar Point Nursery v.

so can -- can -- can I\n\n9    just ask you to clarify this?\n\n10              As I understood what you said to\n\n11    Justice Alito, you said maybe a 365/24 taking of\n\n12    an easement, something that did, in fact,\n\n13    qualify as an easement, maybe that would be a\n\n14    per se taking.  You sort of said maybe to that.\n\n15              But -- but, if this weren\u0027t -- if it\n\n16    was not a formal easement, you know, if there\n\n17    was not a discrete property interest, that the\n\n18    365/24 possession of property would not qualify\n\n19    as a per se taking but instead would be resolved\n\n20    under Penn Central.  Is that correct?\n\n21              MR. MONGAN:  No, Your Honor, and --\n\n22    and let me clarify.  We think Loretto and Nollan\n\n23    make clear that if you have a permanent and\n\n24    continuous access right, whether it\u0027s a\n\n25    requirement under an easement or just a\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n57\n\n1    regulatory access right, that would be per se.\n\n2    But --\n\n3              JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.

That\u0027s the Court\u0027s\n\n17    -- that\u0027s the line that this Court has always\n\n18    drawn.
