Thank you, Mr.\n\nChief Justice.\n\nSo, just to sum up, Respondents ask\n\nthis Court to say not one but two implausible\n\nthings:  first, that when Congress used the\n\nphrase \"punishable by death\" in 1986, it ignored\n\nboth its own judgment about punishment, of what\n\npunishable was appropriate, and the phrase\u0027s\n\nsettled meaning in operation and other\n\nlimitations provisions.  No Article III court\u0027s\n\never read the phrase that way, and Congress was\n\nnot upending how limitations provisions normally\n\nwork.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"28","file_name":"United States v.

Review\n\njust five months later, it was, therefore, clear\n\nthat rape was not such an offense because the\n\nUCMJ itself foreclosed the death penalty.\n\nIndeed, that was still clear for over\n\na decade after the 1986 amendment, as military\n\ncourts repeatedly held that rape was subject to\n\na five-year statute of limitations.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, that\n\nconclusion was still clear to Congress in 2003,\n\nwhen it provided that, where the victim was a\n\nminor, rape by a service member could be\n\nprosecuted until the victim\u0027s 25th birthday.\n\nIf Congress believed that rape was\n\npunishable by death under the 1986 amendment,\n\nthe 2003 reform was not just unnecessary, it\n\nwould have shortened the statute of limitations.\n\nCongress finally eliminated a statute\n\nof limitations for all rape offenses in 2006 so\n\nthat the military may today try any such offense\n\ncommitted since then.

We -- we certainly\n\nagree, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\nI think it\u0027s worth\n\nputting in context that the 1986 amendment was\n\nalmost doubling the statute of limitations for\n\nrape, that adds a civilian offense under the\n\npre-\u002786 code. Rape carried only a three-year\n\nstatute of limitations.  The 1986 amendment\n\nextends that to five.\n\nAnd, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I think\n\nthe timing is the key here.  Congress changed\n\nthe provision in the UCMJ at a time when it was\n\nnot just clear that this Court believed rape\n\ncould not be punished by death under the Eighth\n\nAmendment but right after the Court of Military\n\nAppeals had held that it couldn\u0027t be punished by\n\ndeath even under the UCMJ.\n\nAnd so, for all that the government\n\nrelies upon adding the words \"under this\n\nchapter\" to Article 55, we end up in the same\n\nplace.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Coker,\n\nconcerning the death penalty itself, and our\n\nstatute here on statute of limitations, they\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n38\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nseem particularly distinct in that none of the\n\nanalysis in Coker applies at least directly to\n\nthe military context.

VLADECK: So the -- we have two\n\ndifferent pieces of evidence, Justice Thomas.\n\nOf course, as we note in page -- on page 37 of\n\nthe red brief in Footnote 14, when that language\n\nwas added to the Articles of War, the precursor\n\nto the UCMJ, in 1920, it was added with the\n\nspecific purpose of aligning the military code\n\nthen in force to the Constitution.\n\nBut, Justice Thomas, more importantly,\n\nwe have 70 years of unbroken jurisprudence by\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nevery military court to consider the question,\n\nstarting with the Court of Military Appeals in\n\nWappler in 1953, holding that that was\n\nCongress\u0027s intent.\n\nCongress has amended the UCMJ dozens\n\nof times since those rulings and has shown no\n\ndisagreement with them. It has never touched\n\nArticle 55.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  On a separate issue,\n\nlet\u0027s assume that you leave all the language in\n\nplace in the -- in the statute, but there is a\n\nuniform policy both at the Pentagon and in the\n\nWhite House for many years not to call for the\n\ndeath penalty in the case of rape.\n\nWould that policy in some way trump\n\nthe language in the statute?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"34","file_name":"United States v.

So this Court -- I mean,\n\nI think we\u0027ve had examples, Justice Alito, where\n\nthe death penalty remains available, for\n\nexample, for rape that results in death. We\u0027ve\n\nhad examples -- for example, Mr. Wall had a\n\nhypothetical about rape as a war crime.\n\nThat is not what was charged here.\n\nThe military has the separate capacity to charge\n\nwar crimes under different articles of the UCMJ\n\nand, where the laws of war recognize the death\n\npenalty for that charge, to pursue the death\n\npenalty in that case.\n\nJustice Alito, we would not suggest\n\nthat case was settled by Coker, but where, as\n\nhere, there is no charge under those provisions,\n\nwhere it\u0027s simply under Article 120, which I\n\nshould say Congress has not -- never sort of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nreenacted with the death penalty after 1950,\n\nbefore the Respondents\u0027 offenses, we think\n\nCoker, through Article 55, covers the case.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nJustice Sotomayor.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I will pass.\n\nThank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Vladeck, if I\n\ncould take you back to the government\u0027s textual\n\nargument, and, as I understand it, it goes","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"43","file_name":"United States v.

And so I don\u0027t think the\n\ngovernment\u0027s argument carries the weight it\n\nthinks it does when we go back to 1950, when the\n\nstatute was enacted.\n\nBut, more fundamentally, it was three\n\nyears after the statute was enacted in 1953 that\n\nthe Court of Military Appeals in Wappler read\n\nArticle 55 directly contrary to the government\u0027s\n\nposition, not as simply prohibiting particularly\n\nbarbaric methods but as reflecting that Congress\n\ncertainly intended to confer as much protection\n\nas that afforded by the Eighth Amendment.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, if Congress had\n\ncome back after Wappler or after Coker and said\n\nwe understand that, but we are still reenacting\n\nthe death penalty for rape, this would be a very\n\ndifferent case.\n\nBut it never did.  That is to say, the\n\nstatute, Article 120, that was at issue in all\n\nthree of the Respondents\u0027 cases, was unchanged\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"51","file_name":"United States v.

as a matter of the language, looked to the\n\nstatutory punishment fixed by Congress.\n\nAll of that points to the notion that\n\n\"punishable by death\" means the judgment that\n\nCongress made in the UCMJ.  And so, to revise my\n\nanswer to Justice Kagan somewhat, I think\n\nCongress would need to make a contrary judgment\n\nin the UCMJ to affect the meaning of Article 43.\n\nWhen pressed, counsel went two places.\n\nThe first was the canons, but, as I tried to\n\nexplain, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any grievous\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n64\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nambiguity when you take into account the text\n\nand the contextual clues that Respondents really\n\nhaven\u0027t grappled with.\n\nAnd the canons, as I tried to say to\n\nJustice Kagan, point in -- in both directions.\n\nAnd the most powerful canon, I would say, is\n\nconstitutional avoidance and not getting into\n\nthese long-reserved and difficult Eighth\n\nAmendment questions.\n\nMy second point is I don\u0027t think it\n\nwould do any violence to military law to read\n\nthe code that way.  Willenbring existed side by\n\nside with Article 55 for quite some time.  And\n\nwhen you -- when Justice Thomas pressed\n\nRespondents\u0027 counsel on the meaning of Article\n\n55, you know, he turned to the military courts,\n\nnot text and history.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"56","file_name":"United States v.
