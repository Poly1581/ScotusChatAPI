good morning, Ms. Windham.\n\nI want\n\nto follow up on some of Justice Alito\u0027s\n\nquestions and just make sure I have some of the\n\nfacts down pat here.\n\nFirst, as I understand

So foster parents can be denied the\n\nability to serve as foster parents because of\n\ntheir disability.\n\nSo, again, the City is allowing that\n\nsort of dignitary harm that Your Honor pointed\n\nto, and they\u0027re saying that sometimes that\n\ndignitary harm isn\u0027t enough, but they are not\n\nwilling to allow that to happen in this context,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"37","file_name":"Fulton v.

It\u0027s always up to the parents\u0027\n\nchoice to work with an FCA.\n\nNow, at the child matching stage, that\n\nlooks to the best interests of the child, like\n\nthe federal standard and that in all 50 states.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t categorically exclude anyone.  It\n\nlooks to all potentially relevant\n\nconsiderations.\n\nAnd what my friend on the other side\n\nis doing is taking one thing, which is the very,\n\nvery narrow, limited use of race, that\u0027s taken\n\ninto account as part of the best interests of\n\nthe child, which is mandated by state law. And\n\nI asked the City, when have you ever taken race\n\ninto account?

The Court recognized before\n\nSmith itself, in cases like Lyng and Roy, that\n\nwhen we\u0027re dealing with internal affairs of the\n\ngovernment and its own operations, that a simple\n\n-- a different test applies.\n\nAnd the test that I would say governs\n\nthis case, which is really quite narrow in this\n\nsense because it\u0027s a government contracting\n\ncase, is the test the Court made -- laid out in\n\nNASA versus Nelson, where the Court asked\n\nwhether it was a reasonable rule that the\n\ngovernment was insisting for its contractors.\n\nAnd, actually, the Court in that case\n\nused the phrase \"internal operations.\"  So all\n\nyou have to do is put Nelson together with Lyng\n\nand Roy, which tell you that the Free Exercise\n\nClause allows the government the same power when\n\nit deals with its internal operations.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n97","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"84","file_name":"Fulton v.

Well, Justice Barrett, I\n\nthink, for purposes of your analysis here, it is\n\nlike race discrimination.\n\nI understand that\n\nrace is special in many ways in the Court\u0027s\n\njurisprudence.  But, as Justice Gorsuch stressed\n\nin Masterpiece Cakeshop, it is the proudest\n\nboast of free exercise jurisprudence that we do\n\nnot judge the legitimacy or the offensiveness of\n\nreligious beliefs if they are deeply felt,\n\nwhich, as we know from the Bob Jones case, for\n\nexample, some religious organizations do have\n\ndeeply felt views about interracial marriage.\n\nI think the Court would have to accept\n\nthem. Then the only question would be whether\n\nthe compelling interest test applies differently\n\nin that scenario, and I don\u0027t think it would.\n\nAs a matter of just compelling\n\ninterest law, the Court has said not just that\n\ngovernments have an interest in eradicating race\n\ndiscrimination, but also, in Jaycees, the Court\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n114\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nsaid sex discrimination, as we know from last\n\nterm in Bostock, this could be thought of as sex\n\ndiscrimination.
