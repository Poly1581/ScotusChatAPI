Review\n\ndemonstrate that the Ninth Circuit erred. In\n\nDai, the agency pointed to ample evidence\n\nundermining the persuasiveness of Dai\u0027s\n\ntestimony regarding his family\u0027s persecution,\n\nincluding undisputed evidence of his wife\u0027s\n\nvoluntary return to China.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit rejected the\n\nagency\u0027s reasoning because it concluded that the\n\nabsence of an adverse credibility determination\n\nentitled a reviewing court to disregard some\n\nrecord evidence and to treat the alien\u0027s\n\nallegations of persecution as fact.\n\nSimilarly, in Alcaraz, the court of\n\nappeals expressly relied on the erroneous\n\nprinciple that the absence of an adverse\n\ncredibility determination permits a presumption\n\nof truth, and it applied that presumption to\n\njustify ignoring the ample evidence underlying\n\nthe agency\u0027s determination that Alcaraz\n\ncommitted a particularly serious crime when he\n\nwillfully inflicted corporal injury on the\n\n17-year-old mother of his child.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit therefore subverted\n\nthe statutory scheme that Congress created.\n\nRather than placing the burden on the alien, the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n6","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"3","file_name":"Wilkinson v.

So I don\u0027t think that -- you --\n\nyou seem to be leaning heavily on the fact that\n\nthe statute uses both the words \"credibility\"\n\nand \"persuasiveness,\" and I just don\u0027t see it.\n\nSo I want to ask you what\u0027s wrong with\n\nseeing it this way:  that the IJ makes a\n\ndetermination about credibility, and that has to\n\nbe express, and when it gets up to the Board,\n\nthere are two ways in which the Board might have\n\nto confront this presumption.  Either the IJ\n\nactually found the alien incredible and the\n\nBoard disagrees, in which case it has to\n\nconfront the presumption and explain why it\n\nthinks the evidence rebuts that presumption of\n\ncredibility, or the IJ might not have done a\n\ngood enough job in making an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination explicit, as the statute requires,\n\nand then, still, the Board has to presume\n\ncredibility and then explain why it thinks the\n\npresumption is rebutted.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n44\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nIf the Board offers such an\n\nexplanation, once it gets up to the court of","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"40","file_name":"Wilkinson v.

Breyer was worried about this\n\nbeing too burdensome.\n\nBut this isn\u0027t hard to\n\nmeet.\n\nIndeed, it\u0027s how immigration judges have\n\noperated for decades, as I was just saying to\n\nJustice Barrett.  It requires no magic words,\n\njust a reasoned explanation, which this Court in\n\nJudulang has already unanimously said applies.\n\nAnd, Justice Alito, you had suggested\n\nthat the record here was enough. And if you\n\nwere sitting as a rational basis court, I think\n\nyou could find something to justify what the\n\nagency did, but that\u0027s not the test.\n\nHere, as the Ninth Circuit said, there\n\nwere two contradictory accounts.

Here, the IJ wrote a\n\ndetailed opinion except in the one place where\n\nit mattered, its reasoning. It tells us\n\neverything else but that.  And you wouldn\u0027t\n\naccept this reasoning or lack thereof if this\n\nwere the SEC or EPA.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nThe parties have no real dispute, as\n\nthis argument shows, as to the legal question on\n\nwhich this Court granted certiorari.  And at\n\nleast in Mr. Dai\u0027s case, the court of appeals\n\napplied the precise legal framework that all\n\nparties accept.\n\nThe court did not presume Dai\u0027s\n\ncredible testimony to be true but held that the\n\nrecord compelled the conclusion that Dai\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n74\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ntestimony, if credible, was persuasive.\n\nThat case-specific conclusion was\n\nplainly correct.  Mr. Dai\u0027s eligibility for\n\nasylum and his entitlement to withholding turned\n\nentirely on whether he was, in fact, persecuted\n\nbased on his resistance to the Chinese\n\ngovernment\u0027s forced abortion of his child.\n\nMr. Dai testified in great detail\n\nabout that persecution and submitted significant\n\nevidence corroborating his testimony.\n\nThe government agrees that the agency\n\nhere made no adverse credibility finding; in\n\nother words, the agency did not conclude that\n\nDai lied.  And there is simply no evidence in\n\nthe record that would support a conclusion that\n\nDai was not lying but was nevertheless somehow\n\nmistaken about the severe persecution inflicted\n\non him.  This Court should therefore affirm.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel,\n\nfirst, did Mr. Katyal say anything with which\n\nyou disagree?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"70","file_name":"Wilkinson v.

So I have a question about Justice\n\nKagan\u0027s two ways to understand what the Board\n\nhas done:  one, that Mr. Dai was lying, or the\n\nother, that he was telling the truth, but\n\nexternal circumstances show that he was\n\nmistaken.\n\nAnd my question is about the standard\n\nof review that the Board would apply in\n\nreviewing the IJ\u0027s explanation.  So, in the\n\nfirst scenario, the lying, we all agree that\n\nthere would be a rebuttable presumption that he\n\nwas actually telling the truth, right?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"90","file_name":"Wilkinson v.
