BRONNI\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. BRONNI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nPharmacy Benefit Managers are drug\n\nmiddlemen that reimburse pharmacists for the\n\ncost of prescription drugs.  Those\n\nreimbursements are frequently below a\n\npharmacist\u0027s cost.  That drives pharmacists out\n\nof business, and it has left many communities\n\nwithout a pharmacist.\n\nAct 900 responded to that practice by\n\nregulating what PBMs pay pharmacists.  That\n\nresponse isn\u0027t preempted for three reasons.  It\n\ndoesn\u0027t regulate benefits, it doesn\u0027t regulate\n\nplan administration, and it doesn\u0027t regulate --\n\nor discriminate against ERISA entities.\n\nFirst, Act 900 does not regulate\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Rutledge v.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nAt the end of the day, ERISA doesn\u0027t\n\npreempt state rate regulation, and Act 900 is\n\nstate rate regulation.  Indeed, to put an even\n\nfiner point on it, this case is Travelers.\n\nAll the provisions at issue here\n\nregulate rates or, at a minimum, they all\n\nimplement or enforce Arkansas\u0027s rate regulation.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n25\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd Respondent doesn\u0027t dispute that.

If it\n\ndoes, then the law has an impermissible\n\nconnection with ERISA plans.  But, if it does\n\nnot, then there is no impermissible connection\n\nand no ERISA preemption.\n\nHere, the Arkansas law directly\n\nregulates the relationship between PBMs and\n\npharmacies, namely, the PBMs\u0027 method of\n\nreimbursing pharmacies for prescription drugs.\n\nSo the question becomes, is pharmacy\n\nreimbursement a central matter of plan\n\nadministration?  The answer is no.  From the\n\nplan\u0027s perspective, pharmacy reimbursement is\n\nsimply a matter of cost.\n\nAnd as this Court\u0027s decisions in\n\nTravelers and De Buono make clear, cost isn\u0027t a\n\ncentral matter of plan administration.

good morning, Mr. Liu.\n\nYou said at the outset that cost is\n\nnot a central matter of plan administration.\n\nAnd I think, when you zoom out, that statement\n\nsuggests something\u0027s gone awry here in the\n\njurisprudence because costs will directly affect\n\nthe benefits paid to beneficiaries, and the goal\n\nof ERISA, after all, was to protect American\n\nworkers, including, it would seem, against state\n\nregulation that would perhaps favor state\n\nbusinesses over state workers.\n\nSo why shouldn\u0027t ERISA care about\n\ncosts that are going to be increased and thereby\n\npassed on in the form of lower benefits or worse\n\nbenefits to, here, Arkansas workers?\n\nMR. LIU: Well, I think Travelers\n\nalready answered this question.  We had the same\n\nissue in Travelers, as the Court recognized on\n\npage 659.

the way to make\n\nthat market-based approach work is to create a\n\nmechanism where the plan -- where the PBMs and\n\nthe pharmacies can work out the reimbursement\n\nrate.\n\nThat is a less restrictive approach\n\nthan the regime that was before this Court in\n\nTravelers.  And I think it would be strange if a\n\nless restrictive approach was found to have a\n\ngreater connection with ERISA plans.\n\nI\u0027d also add that Travelers rejected\n\nany distinction between a purely economic rate\n\nregulation and regulations that may affect\n\nprocedures.  Red -- Travelers itself discussed\n\nquality standards and workplace regulations.\n\nSuch laws would surely have an effect\n\non a PBM\u0027s procedures, but the Court went out of\n\nits way to say:  Look, we can\u0027t draw any\n\nprincipled line between rate regulation on the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n--\n\n39\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\none hand and all sorts of other laws on the\n\nother that have an effect on cost.\n\nI guess I\u0027d just like to end by\n\nemphasizing that Travelers really does decide\n\nthis case by making clear that how a provider is\n\nreimbursed is not a central matter of plan\n\nadministration.  Respondent attempts to\n\ndistinguish Travelers, but each of those\n\narguments is answered by Travelers itself.\n\nAnd, really, what Respondent\u0027s\n\nargument amounts to is a request that this Court\n\ncut back on or overrule Travelers.

In doing so, it adds to a\n\nthicket of varying state laws that make uniform\n\nplan administration impossible.\n\nNow Arkansas says it can dictate how\n\nplans should be administered as a means of\n\nso-called rate regulation.  But state regulation\n\nof ERISA plans as a means to some other end,\n\nwhether it\u0027s rate regulation or otherwise, has\n\nnever been permitted.\n\nNone of the cases Arkansas or the SG\n\ncites involve laws directing plan administrators","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"36","file_name":"Rutledge v.
