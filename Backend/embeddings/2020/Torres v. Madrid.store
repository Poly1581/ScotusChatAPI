I\u0027m not sure\n\nPetitioners take an explicit position on those\n\nfleeting non-restraining physical touches.\n\nBut we do think that an important\n\nrestriction on the test and a restriction that\n\nis reflected in Hodari D. is that the physical\n\ntouch must reflect an effort to restrain\n\nmovement.\n\nThat is consistent with this Court\u0027s\n\ndecision in INS against Delgado, which, as you\n\nreferenced, involved a shoulder tap.  Hodari D.\n\nincludes that restriction in defining a seizure.\n\nAnd the common law sources cited in Hodari D.\n\nare consistent with that restriction.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if there\u0027s\n\na tap on the shoulder and the officer says,\n\nyou\u0027re -- I don\u0027t mean to hold you up, you\u0027re\n\nfree to go, but, you know, I want to talk to you\n\nabout this, does that qualify as a seizure?\n\nMS.

TAIBLESON:  No, I don\u0027t have a\n\ncase precisely like that, Justice Thomas.  I\n\nthink my friend mentioned the Countess of\n\nRutland case in 1604 in which there was an\n\nindirect touching, but, in that case, the\n\nCountess, who was the arrestee, did sub -- sub\n\n-- submit to the arrest and she didn\u0027t flee.\n\nThat being said, the language in\n\nCountess of Rutland case indicates that the\n\ntouching through the mace alone was what\n\neffected the arrest.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"25","file_name":"Torres v.

And the seizure\n\nlasts for as long as the physical force is being\n\napplied.  There is simply no other way to read\n\nHodari D. This Court has never called Hodari D.\n\ninto doubt, nor has it ever decided a case whose\n\nresult goes the other way.\n\nThis Court has also repeatedly\n\nemphasized that the Fourth Amendment analysis is\n\nan objective one.  The Hodari D. test focuses\n\nnot on an officer\u0027s mental state but, rather, on\n\nhow a reasonable person would have understood\n\nhis conduct.\n\nUnder that test, Ms. Torres was\n\nseized, albeit briefly, so the Fourth Amendment\n\napplies.

We should not translate that body of\n\ncase law cited by the Petitioner regarding the\n\nmere touch rule because it arose in a very\n\nlimited and narrow context.\n\nAs the Court has pointed out\n\nrepeatedly today, it arose in the context of\n\nDickensian debt collection practices existing in\n\nthe late 18th Century.  The constabulary and the\n\nbailiffs of the late 18th Century are far\n\ndifferent from our modern police force of today.\n\nIn fact, as Petitioner pointed out, we didn\u0027t\n\nhave public modern police forces until the\n\nmid-19th Century.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought\n\nour --\n\nMR.
