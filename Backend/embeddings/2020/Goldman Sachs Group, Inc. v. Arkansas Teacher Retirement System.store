SHANMUGAM\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nIn this case, the court of appeals\n\nupheld the certification of a securities class\n\naction based on exceptionally generic and\n\naspirational statements in the face of\n\noverwhelming and unrebutted evidence that the\n\nstatements had no impact on the stock price.\n\nIn so doing, the court of appeals\n\ncommitted two legal errors.\n\nFirst, the court refused to consider\n\nthe generality of the statements as evidence\n\ntending to disprove price impact.  As\n\nRespondents now agree, a court may consider the\n\nnature of a statement in making that\n\ndetermination.  There is no merit to the further\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncontention that a court may consider the nature\n\nof the statement only through expert testimony.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. v.

The lower courts desperately\n\nneed guidance on how to navigate this Court\u0027s\n\ndecisions on the Basic presumption.

And if you look at the Beetle\n\nhypothetical in the court of appeals opinion at\n\npage 16a of the petition appendix, I think you\n\nsee an example of that.\n\nBut this case is a far cry from that\n\nbecause the plaintiffs don\u0027t even deign to\n\nidentify the inflation-causing event.  And there\n\nis a mismatch between the alleged misstatement\n\nand the alleged corrective disclosures precisely\n\nbecause the alleged misstatements are so\n\nexceedingly generic, statements like our\n\nclients\u0027 interests always come first, integrity\n\nand honesty are at the heart of our business,\n\nand so forth.\n\nAnd where you have that mismatch\n\nbetween the alleged misstatements and the\n\nalleged corrective disclosures, it casts doubt\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"7","file_name":"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. v.

 Well, the court of\n\nappeals not only took the nature of the\n\nstatements off the table, but, in assessing the\n\nevidence, it really attached no significance to\n\nthe nature of the statements, and that was the\n\ndistrict court\u0027s error as well.\n\nAnd so our view is that once that is\n\ncorrected, this is an easy case because of the\n\nexceptionally generic nature of the statements.\n\nJUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.

Subject to Final Review\n\nHalliburton II is that defendants would still\n\nbear the initial burden of production on price\n\nimpact.\n\nI think, in Halliburton II, the Court\n\nconcluded that if price impact were essentially\n\na requirement that plaintiffs would have to\n\nestablish, it would really neuter the fraud-on-\n\nthe-market presumption because it would make it\n\nimpossible for the plaintiffs to have the\n\nbenefit of the presumption.\n\nBy contrast, our submission here is\n\nsimply that this presumption works like any\n\nother presumption.  And Rule 301 makes clear\n\nthat, as to presumption, the burden of\n\nproduction shifts but not the burden of\n\npersuasion, unless the presumption is provided\n\nfor by federal statute or by rule.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And on that\n\nscore, I guess your friends on the other side\n\nwould respond, it\u0027s a mistake to think about the\n\nBasic presumption as a presumption at all.  It\u0027s\n\nreally more like a substantive rule or a proxy.\n\nWhat do -- what do you say to that?\n\nMR.

JOSHI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nThe parties largely seem to agree with\n\neach other and with us on the first question\n\npresented, and the only lingering disagreement\n\nappears to be whether the generic nature of a\n\nmisstatement must be introduced solely through\n\nexpert evidence.\n\nAnd in our view, there\u0027s no sound\n\nreason to impose that kind of artificial limit.\n\nThe more generic a statement is, the less likely\n\nit is to have had a price impact.\n\nAnd there\u0027s nothing wrong with the\n\nCourt taking that likelihood into account as\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npart of its calculus about which one of two\n\ncompeting narratives to credit, just like it\n\nwould do with credibility or the Daubert\n\nfactors.\n\nOn the second question, Rule 301\n\ndoesn\u0027t answer the question because it says the\n\nburden remains on the party who had it\n\noriginally.  And to find that out, you have to\n\nlook to substantive law.\n\nAnd to the extent Halliburton II\n\ndoesn\u0027t already dictate an answer, this Court\n\nshouldn\u0027t adopt one that would essentially work\n\nthe radical alteration of Basic that Halliburton\n\nII itself was loathe to effectuate.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"51","file_name":"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. v.

GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kagan, there\u0027s\n\na good reason they don\u0027t say it that way.  It\u0027s\n\nbecause the Petitioners didn\u0027t make this\n\nargument.  The Petitioners did not argue to the\n\nSecond Circuit that the generic nature of the\n\nstatement, as a common-sense matter, ought to\n\nweigh in the balance.\n\nIt is very hard to complain to the\n\nSecond Circuit and somewhat insulting to the\n\nSecond Circuit to reverse them on a ground that\n\nthey don\u0027t have a clear articulation of why an\n\nargument is wrong that was not made to them when\n\nthe same argument was not made to the district\n\ncourt either.\n\nWhat they do do is respond to Judge","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"64","file_name":"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. v.
