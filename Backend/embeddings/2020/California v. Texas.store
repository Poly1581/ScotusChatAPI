The\n\namended statute doesn\u0027t require anything of\n\nanyone.

Review\n\nin the U.S. Code today. The first is the\n\nindividual mandate, which is a command to the\n\nAmerican people to purchase health insurance\n\nthat the federal government deems suitable. The\n\nsecond is a penalty provision that ensures that\n\nthe mandate raises no revenue for the federal\n\ngovernment.  The third is a legislative finding\n\nenshrined in the text of the law itself\n\ndeclaring the mandate essential to the operation\n\nof the marketplace reforms that the ACA set out\n\nto achieve.  The Obama administration\u0027s\n\nDepartment of Justice described that finding as\n\na functional inseverability clause.\n\nUnder NFIB versus Sebelius, the\n\nmandate as it exists today is unconstitutional.\n\nIt is a naked command to purchase health\n\ninsurance, and, as such, it falls outside\n\nCongress\u0027s enumerated powers.  And the\n\nlegislative findings declaring the mandate\n\nessential require this Court to conclude, as did\n\nthe district court below and the joint dissent\n\nin NFIB, that the mandate is inseverable from\n\nthe remainder of the law.\n\nIn asking the Court to hold otherwise,\n\nPetitioners are really asking this Court to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"55","file_name":"California v.

to calculate\n\neligibility based on modified adjusted income,\n\nwhat would happen if you didn\u0027t do that?\n\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, we don\u0027t know for\n\ncertain because we haven\u0027t tried, but I believe\n\nthe federal government could bring some action\n\nagainst us, or somebody who should be eligible\n\nfor Medicaid under the ACA but -- but isn\u0027t\n\nbecause of the way we\u0027ve done the regulations, I\n\nsuppose, would be able to sue us.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Would there be\n\npenalties?  Does the statute -- does the\n\nAffordable Care Act set out any penalties for --\n\nfor failing to do that?\n\nMR. HAWKINS: I -- I don\u0027t know of a\n\nspecific penalty or fine that would be levied\n\nagainst the state in connection with a failure\n\nto comply with the Maiji requirements.  Of\n\ncourse, there are penalties that states can\n\nsuffer in connection with IRS reporting and --\n\nand other things like that.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"64","file_name":"California v.

HAWKINS: Well, the -- the\n\nprovisions in 6055 and 6056 are -- flow from the\n\nmandate and are echoed in IRS regulations.  The\n\n2020 instructions, which were released recently,\n\nsay that the states have to provide this\n\ninformation to the federal government about how\n\nthey are covering as employers their employees.\n\nAnd that reporting requirement itself\n\ninflicts a pocketbook injury on the states.\n\nThose forms don\u0027t produce themselves.\n\nAnd our theory is that that pocketbook\n\ninjury itself is enough to -- to satisfy Article\n\nIII.

HAWKINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  Just a couple points.\n\nOn standing, the regulatory burden\n\nthat is imposed today by the IRS forms is the\n\nmost straightforward way to conclude that the\n\nstates have suffered a pocketbook injury.\n\nAnd, in any event, Department of\n\nCommerce versus New York confirms that the\n\nstates suffer another pocketbook injury as a\n\npredictable consequence of ordering people to\n\nsign up for insurance.\n\nSecond, on severability, we submit\n\nthat even if this Court is disinclined to\n\ninvalidate every provision of the ACA, it should\n\nat a minimum agree with the Obama administration\n\nthat under the text of the law, the mandate is\n\ninseverable from the three-legged stool.\n\nThird, on practical effects, I want to\n\nemphasize that we recognize the reliance\n\ninterests at stake in this regulatory regime.\n\nThe district court has stayed its partial final\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n92\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\njudgment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"82","file_name":"California v.
