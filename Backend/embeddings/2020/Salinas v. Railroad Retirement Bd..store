Harris.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH M.\n\nHARRIS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS.\n\nHARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nBecause Congress, in Section 355(f),\n\nsubjected any final decision of the Railroad\n\nRetirement Board to judicial review, all final\n\ndecisions, including reopening denials, are\n\nreviewable.\n\nThe government is incorrect that\n\n355(f) limits review only to decisions under\n\n355(c).\n\nFirst, the government reads 355(f) to\n\nsay parties aggrieved by any final decision\n\nunder 355(c) may challenge any such final\n\ndecision.  That impermissibly adds the word\n\n\"such.\"  355(f) says any final decision, full\n\nstop. Any final decision tracks the broad\n\nlanguage of Section 231g, the RRA\u0027s parallel\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\njudicial review provisions governing claims like\n\nMr. Salinas\u0027s.\n\nSecond, only our reading makes sense\n\nof both the RUIA and the RRA. Section 355(c)\n\nmandates hearings or Board appeals for specific\n\nRUIA decisions. If Congress wanted to limit\n\njudicial review across both statutes, the RRA\n\nshould parallel 355(c).  But it doesn\u0027t.  The\n\nRRA doesn\u0027t mandate any hearings.

HARRIS: So I think there\u0027s a key\n\ndistinction that underlies a lot of this Court\u0027s\n\ncases and explains why there\u0027s such a strong\n\ntradition of judicial review for reopening\n\ndenials, especially when they involve new\n\nevidence, like the case here.\n\nAnd that reason is, when you have\n\nsomething where a litigant is, for instance,\n\nasking for reopening on the basis of new\n\nevidence or new circumstances, that does make\n\nthe claim different and makes it something\n\nthat\u0027s possible for courts to review in a way\n\nthat\u0027s different from maybe a pure rehash.\n\nSo, in Brotherhood of Locomotive\n\nEngineers, for instance, the Court distinguished\n\nbetween those two things and said it would be\n\nfundamentally unfair to deny someone the\n\nopportunity to present new evidence that the\n\nagency hadn\u0027t considered before. And that also,\n\nI think, distinguishes Sanders, which did\n\ninvolve that kind of rehashing claim.\n\nAnd the Court has thus considered the\n\nrehashing-type claim as potentially committed to\n\nagency discretion but has always allowed\n\njudicial review of denials of reopening like\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"7","file_name":"Salinas v.

HARRIS: So the distinction, I\n\nthink, comes from the idea that they are both\n\nfinal decisions that deny someone benefits or\n\ndeny someone whatever they\u0027re asking on a\n\nreopening claim.\n\nThe reason why the new evidence or\n\nchanged circumstances claim is reviewable and\n\nhas long been reviewable in multiple contexts is\n\nthat it is not something that is unmanageable\n\nfor courts to figure out. It\u0027s not committed to\n\nagency discretion by law.\n\nAnd the reason is you can figure out\n\nthat there\u0027s something that hasn\u0027t been\n\npresented to the agency before that might change\n\nthe outcome, and it would be inequitable not to\n\nlet someone litigate that and get judicial\n\nreview of that type of decision, whereas the\n\nrehash type of claim does, as in Sanders, raise\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npotential concerns about circumvention of the\n\nlimitations period.\n\nSo it\u0027s sort of a combination of the\n\nsense of what is a final decision, but also the\n\nother step of is it the kind of final decision\n\nthat courts can review in a meaningful sense?\n\nAnd that, I think, is the distinction, again,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"18","file_name":"Salinas v.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case is about a narrow issue,\n\nwhether the Railroad Retirement Board\u0027s refusal\n\nto reopen a prior benefits determination is\n\njudicially reviewable.  Every tool of statutory\n\ninterpretation indicates that the answer to that\n\nquestion is no.\n\nFirst is the text.  Section 355(f) of\n\nthe RUIA provides for judicial review only of\n\nthose decisions made under subsection (c).\n\nSubsection (c) is the RUIA\u0027s exhaustion\n\nprovision, and it provides for internal review\n\nof certain particularly significant Board\n\ndecisions.  Reopening determinations are not\n\nlisted in subsection (c) and, therefore, are not\n\njudicially reviewable.\n\nThe RUIA\u0027s structure confirms this\n\nreading.  The RUIA\u0027s exhaustion, judicial\n\nreview, and review exclusivity provisions all\n\nwork together to ensure that the most important\n\nBoard decisions receive internal and judicial\n\nreview through the mechanisms specified in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n37\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nsubsection (f).  Those provisions are\n\ninterlocking, and each covers the same basic\n\ncategory of core substantive determinations\n\nenumerated under subsection (c).\n\nLastly, the government\u0027s reading also\n\naccords with the policies underlying the\n\nrelevant statute.

I\u0027m just curious how all that follows.\n\nMR.\n\nRAYNOR: Your Honor, in Sanders,\n\nthe Court articulated that the presumption in\n\nfavor of judicial review is stronger for\n\nconstitutional claims.  And so it could be --\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, I understand\n\n-- I understand that, counsel.  I\u0027m talking\n\nabout the statute.  Can you help me there?\n\nMR. RAYNOR: Yes.  So 355(g) is the\n\npreclusion provision here.  And in Thunder\n\nBasin, the Court said that a preclusion\n\nprovision like this might not bar other forms of\n\nreview for issues that were truly collateral to\n\nthe agency\u0027s mission.\n\nAnd so one doctrinal way to approach\n\nthis would be to say that a substantial\n\nconstitutional claim is collateral to the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n52\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nagency\u0027s mission and is not covered by 355(g).\n\nBut, again, he\u0027s not pressing that\n\nhere.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nOne thing I would just like to touch\n\non is counsel for Petitioner\u0027s point that this\n\nis a new evidence case rather than a rehash\n\ncase.

Three points.\n\nFirst of all, there is absolutely no\n\nreason to go out on a limb that is fairly\n\nuntested and that I take the government is not\n\nfully comfortable with with respect to 231g,\n\nwhich is to treat rights and liabilities as\n\nnarrower than what it might mean to have all\n\nfinal decisions reviewable under the RUIA.\n\nAnd it would be really perverse to do\n\nso. If you had a situation where short-term\n\nbeneficiaries under the RUIA were entitled to\n\nreopening, yet long-term beneficiaries under the\n\nRRA were not, it really would sort of put -- it\n\ntakes the statutory scheme upside down because\n\nit is the long-term beneficiaries who are the\n\nones who are most in need of a check after that\n\ninitial denial or grant of benefits on changed\n\ncircumstances.\n\nThey are the people who have these\n\nbenefits for potentially a long time or need\n\nthem for a long time.
