And so I don\u0027t think\n\nthere is that kind of sandbagging concern.\n\nThe other reason is that if you did\n\ntry to raise a new fact of bias, like that the\n\nALJ had a personal stake in the case, for the\n\nfirst time in court, that would still fall under\n\nthe new evidence bar of 405(g).  You\u0027d be trying\n\nto present new evidence.

The\n\ngovernment, of course, relies heavily on the\n\nbackground rule that it says largely controls\n\nfrom L.A. Tucker.  If we were to rule in your\n\nfavor in this case, exactly what would you have\n\nus write in our opinion about L.A. Tucker?\n\nMS. HARRIS: I think you could write\n\nexactly what Sims wrote, which is that L.A.\n\nTucker is a rule that applies in adversarial\n\nproceedings and is confined to that context\n\nbecause what it says is that the general rule is\n\nthat you do not vacate agency decisions if the\n\n-- unless the agency had a chance to correct its\n\nerror against the objection made at the time\n\nappropriate under its proceedings, which, again,\n\njust begs the question of whether there was a\n\ntime appropriate to object under the particular\n\nagency proceedings.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"24","file_name":"Carr v.

HARRIS: Sims invited the Social\n\nSecurity Administration to adopt an issue\n\nexhaustion rule.  Instead, the agency still\n\nencourages claimants to rely on ALJs and the\n\nAppeals Council to issue-spot.\n\nIf the agency needs an issue\n\nexhaustion rule to function, one wonders why it\n\nhasn\u0027t engaged in rulemaking and at least let\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n33\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nstakeholders weigh in.\n\nThe government\u0027s appeals to equity do\n\nnot add up.  An exhaustion rule would\n\ndisadvantage hundreds of thousands of\n\nunrepresented claimants.  The government never\n\nexplains why people in dire need of assistance\n\nwould hold back arguments just to sandbag the\n\ngovernment.\n\nAnd the government acknowledges\n\nagencies lack special expertise in\n\nconstitutional questions like the Appointments\n\nClause.

The courts of\n\nappeals have consistently applied that rule in\n\nthe specific context of Social Security ALJ\n\nproceedings for decades.  Petitioners suggest\n\nthat the government is asking the Court to\n\nchange the rules of the game, but the reality is\n\nthe exact opposite.\n\nThe second rule is that a party\n\nforfeits an Appointments Clause challenge by\n\nfailing to raise it before the agency itself.\n\nUnder the traditional de facto officer doctrine,\n\na private party could contest the legitimacy of\n\nan official\u0027s appointment only in a direct suit\n\nagainst the official himself.

And, obviously,\n\nhere, the Commissioner does not think this was\n\nfutile, and, indeed, it wasn\u0027t because the\n\nCommissioner had the power to ratify ALJs, which\n\nshe eventually did.\n\nAs to the constitutional issue that\n\nyou note, we do not agree that there is a\n\ncategorical -- categorical exception for\n\nconstitutional arguments.  Richardson required\n\nexhaustion of a constitutional argument in the\n\nSocial Security context, and all of the cases,\n\nincluding Weinberger v. Salfi, Mathews v. Diaz,\n\nMathews v.

So the agency, for\n\nexample, is much more likely to raise a\n\nforfeiture argument against a represented\n\nclaimant than against an unrepresented claimant.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are certain\n\nissues that come up periodically, like this one,\n\nwhere -- like the Appointments Clause issue,\n\nwhere it will be forced to raise exhaustion\n\nbasically across the board to ward off a large\n\nnumber of claims.\n\nAnd I think it\u0027s important to note\n\njust one -- one point about the number of claims\n\nhere.

think the -- the best approach\n\nhere, which requires the least policymaking by\n\nthe courts, is just a clear background rule.\n\nBut, if the Court wanted to calibrate\n\na rule to the specific circumstances, the issues\n\nto focus on here would be twofold.  One is that\n\nthis isn\u0027t the kind of question that the ALJ has\n\na duty to raise, and so there\u0027s all the more\n\nonus on the claimant to raise it.\n\nAnd then, second, I think the main\n\nthing that should drive the analysis in this\n\ncase is the fact that there\u0027s no allegations of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nprejudice whatsoever.  And so the unfairness,\n\nthe alleged unfairness to the claimant, really\n\nshould not be the motivating factor here\n\nbecause, as Justice Alito pointed out, there\u0027s\n\neffectively no purpose in this do-over.  It\u0027s\n\njust imposing additional labor on the agency for\n\nno real benefit.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you\n\nreally need someone in this position to be able\n\nto raise the Appoints -- Appointments Clause\n\nconcern or -- or it just isn\u0027t raised.\n\nI mean, it is certainly designed to\n\nprotect the separation of powers, which is\n\ndesigned to protect the liberty of all of us.\n\nSo I think there is prejudice in that respect.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"48","file_name":"Carr v.

In Sims, the question\n\nwas whether a claimant needed to raise issues\n\nbefore a particular adjudicator, but, here, the\n\nquestion is whether a claimant needs to raise\n\nissues before the agency at all.\n\nIf the Court has no further questions,\n\nthen I\u0027ll just close briefly -- briefly by\n\nnoting that there are two independent grounds\n\nfor affirming the judgments below.\n\nFirst, the Court can simply decline to\n\nmake an exception to the longstanding background\n\nrule that a party must raise an issue before the\n\nagency in order to preserve that issue for\n\njudicial review.  Sims doesn\u0027t displace that\n\nrule in this particular context.\n\nSecond, the Court can apply Ryder and\n\nLucia\u0027s requirement that a party raise an\n\nappointments challenge before the relevant\n\nadjudicator before that adjudicator acts on its\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncase. Although Petitioners have suggested at\n\npoints that Ryder and Lucia can be explained by\n\nagency-specific exhaustion rules, that argument\n\nignores the actual reasoning of those opinions,\n\nwhich do not cite any such rule.\n\nCases like this one that don\u0027t fall\n\nwithin the narrow exception adopted by Ryder are\n\nbarred by the de facto doctrine. On either of\n\nthese independent grounds, the Court should\n\naffirm the judgments below.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"54","file_name":"Carr v.
