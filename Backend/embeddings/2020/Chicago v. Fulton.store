GOLDBLATT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. GOLDBLATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis case presents the question\n\nwhether the Bankruptcy Code\u0027s automatic stay\n\nrequires a creditor in lawful possession of\n\nestate property when a bankruptcy petition is\n\nfiled to return that property to the debtor\n\nimmediately or else pay damages.\n\nIt does not. The automatic stay\n\nfreezes the state of affairs as of the\n\nbankruptcy filing by enjoining creditors from\n\ntaking post-petition acts to improve their\n\nposition vis-a-vis the debtor.  As this Court\n\nhas repeatedly observed, the automatic stay\u0027s\n\npurpose is to preserve the status quo. It does\n\nnot require creditors to turn over property\n\nlawfully in their possession.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAn entirely separate provision of the\n\ncode, the turnover provision, addresses that\n\nsituation. But, unlike the automatic stay, the\n\nturnover provision does not operate as an\n\ninjunction or mandate the payment of damages if\n\nproperty is not immediately turned over.\n\nThe turnover provision contains a\n\nnumber of statutory exceptions and defenses.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Chicago v.

So the term \"stay\" is, of course,\n\npart of the operative text of 362, and I do\n\nthink there\u0027s a meaningful distinction between\n\nCongress using the very specific language that\n\nfiling a bankruptcy petition will operate as a\n\nstay and Congress merely barring a particular\n\nact.\n\nAnd I -- I think that\u0027s significant\n\nbecause, as this Court said in McCann, a stay is\n\nsomething that prevents the authority to alter\n\nthe status quo. So I do think stay has to be --\n\nhas to be doing some work there.\n\nAs to exercise control, I think part\n\nof that answer goes back to my stay response\n\nbecause I think, even if you thought that\n\nexercising control might plausibly include\n\nmerely passive retention, I don\u0027t think that\n\nthat\u0027s consistent with the use of the word\n\n\"stay.\"\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nI would also say that I think what --\n\nwhat -- what Respondents, I think, now are\n\npointing to as the act is simply refusing to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"34","file_name":"Chicago v.

three reasons, reflected in the\n\nCourt\u0027s questions today, the creditor may not\n\nprevent recovery of the property.\n\nFirst, the automatic stay in\n\nSection 362(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code\n\nprovides that a creditor may not act to exercise\n\ncontrol over a debtor\u0027s property.  The critical\n\nlanguage is \"exercise control.\"  Unlike action\n\nto obtain possession of property, a future event\n\nthat the stay also prohibits, exercising control\n\nover property is ongoing action, and the stay\n\nexpressly stops it.\n\nSecond, the automatic stay works\n\ntogether with the turnover provision in Section\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n47\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\n542(a) of the code, which commands that any\n\nparty holding estate property shall deliver it\n\nto the trustee or debtor. This provision\n\noperates automatically, with no requirement that\n\nthe debtor obtain a court order mandating\n\ncompliance.\n\nThird, the automatic stay and the\n\nturnover provision support a major purpose of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code:  to place all estate\n\nproperty under the court\u0027s jurisdiction and\n\nallow the trustee or debtor to control the\n\nproperty from the outset of the case.\n\nThis Court recognized in Whiting Pools\n\nthat an effective reorganization of a business\n\nor individual will not likely succeed if\n\ncreditors can withhold estate property to get\n\nbetter treatment for themselves.\n\nThe automatic stay protects\n\nreorganization.  It allows greater payments to\n\nall creditors by preventing any one creditor","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"42","file_name":"Chicago v.

Now why\n\nwouldn\u0027t we look to the section of the code\n\nentitled \"turnover of property to the estate\" to\n\nfigure out the answer to that question?\n\nMR. WEDOFF: I think that that\n\nsection, Section 542(a), works hand in hand with\n\nthe automatic stay in Section 362(a)(3).  So,\n\nyes, we do look at 542(a), which tells us that,\n\nas of the outset of the case, there\u0027s a duty to\n\nturn over, but 362(a)(3) enforces that\n\nobligation.  And what we have argued is that it\n\narises when the debtor requests the return of\n\nthe property.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"43","file_name":"Chicago v.

WEDOFF: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nI believe that the questions from the\n\nCourt today have spotlighted the underlying\n\nbasic bankruptcy policy, which is that\n\nbankruptcy trustees and debtors-in-possession\n\nmust be given prompt access to estate property.\n\nThe automatic stay advances this\n\npolicy by preventing creditors from acting\n\nagainst property of the estate.  It prevents\n\ncreditors who hold the debtor\u0027s property before\n\nthe bankruptcy filing from acting to control\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n75\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nthat property while the case is pending.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"68","file_name":"Chicago v.

GOLDBLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  Just a few quick points.\n\nFirst, Justice Gorsuch asked both of\n\nmy friends about the role of 362(a)(6) and\n\nwhether any of these actions are prohibited as\n\nprohibited debt collection activity.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n79\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nI think it\u0027s important to bear in\n\nmind, as this Court\u0027s opinion in Whiting Pools\n\nexplains, that the Bankruptcy Code strikes a\n\ncareful balance between the rights of secured\n\ncreditors on the one hand and the rights of\n\ndebtors to marshal the assets of the estate on\n\nthe other and provides specific rights and\n\nprotections to secured creditors.\n\nAnd where a secured creditor is\n\nseeking to vindicate those rights by holding the\n\nproperty in order to maximize its recovery as a\n\nsecured creditor, whether that\u0027s through\n\nadequate protection or the treatment of its","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"72","file_name":"Chicago v.

In most bankruptcy courts, if a\n\ncreditor responds to a motion by saying, I\n\nshould have gotten an adversary, a bankruptcy\n\njudge will say, did you get actual notice?  And\n\nif you did, why do you care that much about the\n\ncaption on the paper?\n\nSo, while it is true that Rule 7001\n\nsays what it does and that the Rules Committee\n\ncould address that if it thinks appropriate, in\n\nthe real world, this isn\u0027t a problem that is\n\nplaguing bankruptcy courts in actual practice.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"74","file_name":"Chicago v.
