If -- if I\n\nunderstood you right, you said that the only\n\nfinal action that\u0027s being challenged here is the\n\nThird Amendment.

MOOPPAN: So I don\u0027t think you\n\nhave it quite right.  The plaintiffs in this\n\ncase did seek a declaratory judgment that the\n\nstructure of the FH -- FHFA was\n\nunconstitutional, and the Fifth Circuit granted\n\nthem that relief.  And there is a cert petition\n\nthat raises -- that was granted that includes\n\nthat question.

JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there\n\nwere contracts before the Third Amendment too\n\nand they were significantly altered, but I guess\n\nmy question is what if the complaining\n\nstockholders here, you

it has all the powers that\n\nboth the majority and the dissent referred to in\n\nSeila Law.

You know, even\n\nthe dissent again in Seila Law says -- I\u0027m\n\nquoting here -- \"the FHFA plays a crucial role\n\nin overseeing the mortgage market on which\n\nmillions of Americans annually rely.\"\n\nSo how can you say this?\n\nMR.

JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nJustice Barrett.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  So, Mr. Nielson, I\n\nwould have come away from Seila Law thinking\n\nthat there were two exceptions to this rule,\n\nHumphrey\u0027s Executor and Morrison versus Olson.\n\nBut it seems to me -- and this goes\n\nback to some of the questions that Justices\n\nSotomayor and Kagan were pressing you on -- it\n\nseems to me that you\u0027re kind of arguing for a\n\nthird ground here, which is, well, then we take\n\na look at what is the executive official really\n\ndoing. Does this really seem like a lot of\n\nexecutive power or a little executive power,\n\nsomething that looks more like private power?\n\nIt strikes me as a pretty hard test to\n\nadminister.  So could you say a little bit more\n\nabout that?\n\nMR. NIELSON: Sure.  \"Significant,\" of\n\ncourse, is not my word.

So I\n\nlook to Seila Law to understand what the Court\n\nmeans by \"significant.\"  And I think Seila Law\n\nmakes plain that \"significant\" captures the\n\nliberty and accountability concerns that require\n\nplenary control.  The Court focused on two\n\nthings, whether private citizens are being\n\nregulated and whether there is substantial\n\npolicy discretion.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"54","file_name":"Collins v.

No one would say that the\n\n-- the last three years\u0027 worth of payments could\n\nbe challenged.\n\nThat money is owed as a legal matter\n\nunder a valid contract, and there\u0027s no actual\n\nexecutive or discretionary decision being made\n\nin paying the money that\u0027s legally owed.\n\nFinally, on the anti-injunction\n\nclause, which we didn\u0027t have too much time to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n104\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ndiscuss this morning, I guess the key point I\n\nwould try to make is that this wasn\u0027t a\n\nnationalization; it was a renegotiation of\n\ndividend obligation.  And as all the courts of\n\nappeals before the court below recognized, and\n\nas Judge Stras and Judge Bevis explained, the\n\nCourt shouldn\u0027t second-guess that under the\n\nanti-injunction clause.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"95","file_name":"Collins v.
