HAWKINS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\n\nMR. HAWKINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe River Master\u0027s decision to award\n\nevaporative loss delivery credits to New Mexico\n\neffectively deprives the farmers and businesses\n\nof west Texas of a year\u0027s worth of irrigation\n\nand threatens incalculable economic harm should\n\nNew Mexico redeem those credits during a drought\n\nyear.\n\nThat result is unlawful substantively\n\nunder the Pecos River Compact and procedurally\n\nunder this Court\u0027s 1988 amended decree.\n\nNew Mexico and the River Master have\n\noffered only two theories justifying these\n\ndelivery credits, but each violates the plain\n\ntext of the compact that Congress approved.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nNew Mexico\u0027s lead argument is Article\n\nXII, but, as the United States correctly points\n\nout, Article XII cannot and does not justify the\n\nRiver Master\u0027s decision.  It applies only to\n\nconsumptive use of water by the United States,\n\nand it was no use here at all.  The United\n\nStates merely re-regulated the water for public\n\nsafety purposes and released it not when it\n\ncould be used but when the public emergency\n\nexpired.\n\nThe only other substantive provision\n\nNew Mexico and the River Master have pointed to\n\nis C.5 of the River Master Manual.

you tell me exactly why this\n\nassessment by the River Master is wrong?\n\nMR.\n\nHAWKINS: Sure, Justice Thomas.\n\nI\n\nthink it all starts with the compact, which has\n\nthe status of federal law.\n\nThe compact at Article VI(c) says that\n\nthe inflow/outflow method should be used to\n\ndetermine New Mexico\u0027s delivery obligation.\n\nNow that just means that New Mexico\n\ngets credit for water that crosses the state\n\nline and doesn\u0027t get credit for water that does\n\nnot cross the state line.\n\nNow, here, we\u0027re talking about water\n\nthat didn\u0027t cross the state

And so the question is, what in\n\nthe compact allowed the River Master to deviate\n\nfrom the inflow/outflow rule in VI(c)?\n\nAnd New Mexico and the United States\n\nand the River Master have not pointed to any\n\nexception in the compact that allows deviating\n\nfrom this rule.\n\nAnd, indeed, at page 270a of the\n\nrecord, as Your Honor just pointed out, the New\n\nMexico -- the River Master effectively admits\n\nthat.

Well, we\u0027re\n\ntalking about reservoir losses, water that\n\nevaporated.\n\nThere are only three parts in the\n\ncompact that speak to reservoir losses.  One is\n\nVI(d)(3).  That can\u0027t be implicated here,\n\nthough, because these are not unappropriated\n\nfloodwaters, which is all that VI(d)(3) is\n\ntalking about.\n\nThe second is Article XII.

SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming we were\n\ninterested in the Article XII issue, is there\n\nanything in the compact or in any of the\n\namendments to it that would preclude the Court\n\nfrom relying on Article

HAWKINS: Well, the Court, of\n\ncourse, can apply federal law, Your Honor, which\n\nis -- which is what this compact is.  The reason\n\nnot to rely on Article XII is because, by its\n\nplain terms, it doesn\u0027t apply.  There\u0027s no\n\nconsumptive use of water by the United States.\n\nAnd later on in Article XII, it speaks\n\nto water in one state for use in the other\n\nstate. That can\u0027t be a hook to bring that\n\nprovision into this case because the water at\n\nissue was not stored for use in Texas.  It was\n\nre-regulated for flood control.\n\nAnd the best evidence of that, Justice\n\nSotomayor, is that the federal government didn\u0027t\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ncare whether the water could be used when it\n\nreleased the water from Brantley beginning in\n\nAugust of 2015.

And\n\nthen, throughout negotiations, everyone agreed\n\nthat the River Master was, in the end, going to\n\nmake a one-time adjustment.

Texas with evaporation when the water\n\nis stored \"at the request of Texas.\"\n\nThere is no dispute that Texas\n\nrequested that the stormwater be stored for its\n\nbenefit, and there is no dispute that New Mexico\n\nconditioned its consent on the agreement that\n\nall of the evaporation would be charged to\n\nTexas.\n\nNor is there any purchase to Texas\u0027s\n\nargument that the credit to New Mexico was\n\nuntimely.  Both states knew from the time of the\n\nflood that a retroactive adjustment to the\n\naccounting would be made.\n\nWith the agreement of the states, the\n\nRiver Master alerted the Court to the unresolved\n\nissue and established a procedure for resolving\n\nit. New Mexico was justified in following the\n\nprocedure identified by the River Master.\n\nGranting New Mexico a credit for the\n\nTexas water is both consistent with the plain\n\nlanguage of the compact and the River Master\n\nManual and the equitable outcome.

HANSFORD:  Well, we -- we think\n\nthat C.5 plainly applies by its terms. Page 61\n\nof the appendix is a formal request from one\n\ncommissioner to the other saying it is my\n\nrequest that New Mexico store Texas\u0027s portion of\n\nthe flows.\n\nAnd so this is just squarely within\n\nC.5, and the River Master treated it\n\naccordingly.  I think it\u0027s a -- it\u0027s a really\n\nstraightforward application of C.5.\n\nAnd I -- I would note that now Texas\n\nfor the first time is raising questions about\n\nthe derivation of C.5, but C.5 was incorporated\n\nin this Court\u0027s amended decree as an integral\n\npart of the decree.

Indeed, the River Master\n\nadmitted -- and this is at page 286a of the\n\nTexas appendix -- that he wasn\u0027t following the\n\ncompact, that he was doing equity to New Mexico\n\nand he was using C.5 as a free-floating\n\nprovision to do what he subjectively thinks is\n\nfair.\n\nThe United States also doesn\u0027t tie\n\nthis back to the compact, except to invoke\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n72\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nArticle III and the 1947 condition.
