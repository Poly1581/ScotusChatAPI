GOLDSTEIN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe merger doctrine resolved the\n\ncopyrightability question in this case. Oracle\n\nhas a copyright to the computer code in Java SE\n\nbut not a patent.  That means that the public,\n\nnot Oracle, has the right to Java SE\u0027s function,\n\nand Oracle cannot leverage its copyright to\n\ncreate patent-like rights.  Specifically, under\n\nthe merger doctrine, there is no copyright\n\nprotection for computer code that is the only\n\nway to perform those functions.\n\nHere, Java software developers have\n\nthe right to use certain commands to create\n\napplications for Google\u0027s Android smartphone\n\nplatform, but, to work, the commands require\n\nGoogle to reuse an exact set of declarations\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfrom Java SE, like a key that fits into a lock.\n\nBecause there are no substitutes, Oracle is\n\nimpermissibly claiming the exclusive right not\n\nmerely to what the declarations say but also to\n\nwhat the declarations do.  That is not a\n\ncopyright; it is a patent right.\n\nWith respect to fair use, the\n\nlong-settled practice of reusing software\n\ninterfaces is critical to modern interoperable","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Google LLC v.

What that tells us is that\n\nwhen you copyright something and you publish it,\n\nyou disclose it to the public.  Selden disclosed\n\nhis system of bookkeeping, the dual entry\n\nsystem.  What the Court said is, once that\u0027s\n\npublished, then the public has the right to use\n\nit.\n\nSo too here. Once Oracle published\n\nJava SE, people in the public, developers,\n\ncompanies like Google, had the right to create\n\ntheir own versions of it that would provide the\n\nsame functionality.\n\nThen the question was, is there any\n\nway to do it without reusing the expression of\n\nthe original?

That would mean that even if parties\n\nstipulate on all the historical facts, a court\n\ncannot grant summary judgment.\n\nBut granting summary judgment is what\n\ncourts do all the time.  Professor Beebe\n\nidentifies over four -- over 100 fair use cases\n\ndecided by courts on summary judgment in a\n\n30-year time span.

And we agree\n\nthat the Rule 50 standard applies, could any\n\nreasonable jury have reached this verdict, but,\n\nin litigation, it\u0027s -- it\u0027s obviously very\n\ncommon that there can be disputed questions both\n\nof fact and of law.\n\nAnd even when the questions of law are\n\nclose and reasonable, judges could disagree, the\n\ndistrict court is supposed to say what is the\n\nright answer to those legal questions.\n\nAnd so, when we ask could a reasonable\n\njury have found use here, fair use here, we\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n68\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nshould be asking, could a reasonable jury\n\napplying an accurate version of the law have\n\nfound fair use?\n\nAnd so we assume that the jury made\n\nthe factual findings that are most favorable to\n\nGoogle, but then we ask: What is the right\n\nanswer?

not\n\ntransformative?  It moved Java\u0027s platform from a\n\nPC, essentially, to mobile phones.\n\nWhy wasn\u0027t that a transformative step?\n\nI mean, the -- the answer is that all -- that\n\nall fair use involves copying.  So, to do fair\n\nuse, you have to copy something and create\n\nsomething new from it.\n\nSo why wasn\u0027t that a giant step of\n\nfair use?\n\nMR. STEWART: I guess I\u0027d say three or\n\nfour -- four things as to why this wasn\u0027t\n\ntransformative.\n\nThe first is, when Google explains why\n\nit copied these particular declarations and not\n\nothers within the Java platform, the explanation\n\nthat it gives is -- is these are the\n\ndeclarations, these are the functionalities that\n\nwill carry over to a smartphone platform. These\n\nare the declarations that will be useful in the\n\nnew technological environment.

One\n\nquestion on merger doctrine and one question on\n\nmethod of operation.\n\nFirst, Google says in its reply brief\n\nthat the dispositive undisputed fact in this\n\ncase is that the declarations could not be\n\nwritten in any other way and still properly\n\nrespond to the calls used by Java programmers.\n\nAre they wrong in saying that?\n\nMR. STEWART: I don\u0027t think that they\n\nare wrong in saying that, but that argument is\n\ncircular; that is, they are invoking the correct\n\nproposition that merger applies if there\u0027s only\n\na way of getting the computer to perform a\n\nparticular function.  But they are defining the\n\nfunction as invoking the implementing code in\n\nresponse to calls that are known to developers.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"72","file_name":"Google LLC v.

BREYER:  All right.\n\nThank\n\nyou.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  No further questions.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nSotomayor.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Goldstein, is\n\nthis your answer to Mr. Malcolm\u0027s transformative\n\nuse argument, and what\u0027s your best argument on\n\nfair use?\n\nMR. GOLDSTEIN:  Our answer with\n\nrespect to transformative use is it cannot be\n\nthat transformative use only exists when\n\ncomputer code does something different.\n\nComputer code only does one thing.  There is no\n\nparity of computer code.\n\nThat would mean ironically that this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n88\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nhighly and functional expression is less\n\nsusceptible of fair use than a highly creative\n\nnovel. That cannot be right.\n\nAnd, in any event, even if -- if the\n\njury was entitled to conclude based on the\n\nrecord evidence that this was an entirely new\n\ncontext, the Java SE was not useable in this\n\nparticular -- in a smartphone, with respect to\n\nfair use more broadly, our best argument is\n\nabout the standard of review.\n\nUnder Rule 39(c), this mixed question\n\nof fact and law was put to the jury at Oracle\u0027s\n\ninsistence.  The question is, could the jury\n\nhave balanced these factors?  I know that the\n\nother side is concerned about providing legal\n\nguidance.  That\u0027s why we have jury instructions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"79","file_name":"Google LLC v.
