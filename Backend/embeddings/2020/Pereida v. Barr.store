main question here is just whether\n\n15    he can rely on the categorical approach\u0027s \"least\n\n16    acts\" presumption to meet that burden of proof,\n\n17    just as parties may rely on presumptions to\n\n18    satisfy their burdens of proof in many other\n\n19    areas.\n\n20              He can for two reasons.  First, for\n\n21    decades, the statutory term \"convicted\" has been\n\n22    understood to require a categorical approach\n\n23    under which a past offense won\u0027t lead to\n\n24    mandatory removal or an enhanced sentence unless\n\n25    the record of conviction establishes every\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n4\n\n1    element of a federal predicate offense to a\n\n2    legal certainty.\n\n3              So we always presume that a conviction\n\n4    stands for nothing more than the least that the\n\n5    record of conviction establishes.  And that rule\n\n6    works the same under the categorical and\n\n7    modified categorical approaches because courts\n\n8    can look to the least of the alternative\n\n9    elements under a divisible statute, as this\n\n10    Court has.\n\n11              Second, Congress didn\u0027t disturb that\n\n12    rule when it enacted a general burden-of-proof\n\n13    provision that says nothing about convictions.\n\n14    And that\u0027s not surprising because all we\u0027re\n\n15    talking about is a gatekeeping step.  There\u0027s\n\n16    still the discretionary step, where the Attorney\n\n17    General is unbound by the categorical approach\n\n18    and can make an individualized determination\n\n19    about who gets relief.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"Pereida v.

   then compare to the federal offense.\n\n2              JUSTICE THOMAS:  But, here, you know,\n\n3    there seemed to be an underlying current that\n\n4    it\u0027s somewhat unfair to ask the Petitioner here\n\n5    to say what he had just been convicted of in the\n\n6    state courts.\n\n7              Could you explain why you think that\n\n8    would be unfair?  It seemed as though that if I\n\n9    were just convicted of a crime, I would know\n\n10    what it was.\n\n11              MR. GOLDMAN:  So, sure, two -- two\n\n12    responses to that, Justice Thomas.\n\n13              First is that this is in some ways the\n\n14    unusual case that it involves parallel criminal\n\n15    and immigration proceedings.  Oftentimes, these\n\n16    convictions are invoked years after the fact.\n\n17              And just as one example of that, this\n\n18    Court right now is holding a case for this one\n\n19    called Romero that involves a marijuana\n\n20    conviction from 1985.

I think all of that tends to show that\n\n22    the demand for certainty is not a function of\n\n23    the burden of proof.

Are there\n\n10    any other arguments you could make that your\n\n11    client wasn\u0027t, in fact, convicted of a CIMT?\n\n12              For example, I read the Eighth Circuit\n\n13    as saying that a sentence of one year or longer\n\n14    fits the sentencing requirement of not being\n\n15    more than one year.

So -- so the idea\n\n6    is that the categorical approach, the entirety\n\n7    of the approach, is always asking, does a\n\n8    conviction necessarily establish every element\n\n9    of the federal offense?

We decide it by\n\n7    looking under Shepard to a set of legal\n\n8    documents.\n\n9              So here\u0027s my analogy.

The only question\n\n8    I\u0027m talking about now is the preliminary one.\n\n9    What were you convicted of?

Every court of appeals in this country uses\n\n15    a de novo standard in ACCA cases in order to\n\n16    review that determination.  And for that matter,\n\n17    the BIA uses a de novo standard to review the\n\n18    IJ\u0027s determination.\n\n19              So all of that we would have to throw\n\n20    over if all of a sudden we decided that this was\n\n21    a factual question.\n\n22              MR.
