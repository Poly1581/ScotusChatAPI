Pattillo.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL PATTILLO\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR.\n\nPATTILLO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe FTC Act\u0027s test, structure, and\n\npurpose make clear that when Section 13(b)\n\nauthorizes the Commission to seek a permanent\n\ninjunction, it means just that, a permanent\n\ninjunction as traditionally understood.  It does\n\nnot mean injunctions and all equitable relief or\n\ninjunctions and monetary relief for past harms.\n\nThree features of the Act make that\n\nespecially clear.  First, 13(b) is limited to\n\ncases where someone is violating or is about to\n\nviolate the Act.  That limit to ongoing or\n\nimminent violations would make no sense if 13(b)\n\nauthorized retrospective monetary relief for\n\npast harms.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nSecond, where the Act allows relief\n\nbeyond injunctions, it says so. Section 5(l)\n\nauthorizes an injunction and further equitable\n\nrelief as appropriate.  That language would have\n\nbeen pointless if the word \"injunction\" itself\n\nimplied all equitable relief.\n\nThird, another provision, Section 19,\n\nauthorizes monetary relief for past consumer\n\ninjury.  But it provides safeguards, including a\n\nstatute of limitations, a heightened proof\n\nrequirement, and notice to victims.  Those\n\nlimits would be meaningless if they could be","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"2","file_name":"AMG Capital Management, LLC v.

As our amici, the\n\nChamber, has pointed out and as, you know,\n\nthis -- the sweep of the FTC Act is about as\n\nbroad as you can get, reaching into every single\n\narea of commerce, and it\u0027s precisely because the\n\nprohibitions of the Act are so broad and general\n\nthat it\u0027s important to hold the Commission to\n\nits primary responsibility of, you know, telling\n\nbusinesses what the law is prospectively instead\n\nof running to court instead, you know, trying to\n\nseek retrospective monetary relief.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you, counsel.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A minute to\n\nwrap up, Mr. Pattillo.\n\nMR. PATTILLO:  The question here is\n\nwhether 13(b)\u0027s reference to \"permanent\n\ninjunction\" means permanent injunction or\n\nwhether it instead means all equitable relief\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"25","file_name":"AMG Capital Management, LLC v.

But this Court does not impose and\n\nnever has imposed any such requirement.\n\nThe FTC Act, moreover, is striking in\n\nits consistent focus on agency processes to\n\nprospectively define prohibited conduct.  Yet,\n\nunder the Commission\u0027s view, the single\n\nsentence, second-level proviso in 13(b)\n\nauthorizing permanent injunctions is virtually\n\nall the statute it needs.\n\nThe Commission can get all the\n\ninjunctions and monetary relief it wants without\n\nthe burdens of the administrative processes that\n\nwere its very reason for being.

Section 5(l) is used to\n\nenforce cease-and-desist orders, the\n\nadministrative orders, and -- and so there\n\nalready basically is an injunction on the books,\n\nand it\u0027s an injunction that doesn\u0027t come with\n\nany traditional remedies.  So Congress had to\n\nsay exactly what remedies it wanted.  And that\u0027s\n\nwhy it\u0027s limited to mandatory injunctions and\n\nother equitable relief.\n\nBut, in Section 13, Congress didn\u0027t\n\nneed to do that. It could rely on, could\n\npiggyback on, all of the traditional remedies\n\ninherent in a permanent injunction, which is\n\ndifferent from a mandatory injunction.  And so,\n\nyou know, you could look at it that, in fact,\n\nwhat Congress wanted to make sure of was that,\n\nno matter how the Commission proceeded, whether\n\nit proceeded by administrative, by a\n\ncease-and-desist order, or whether it went into\n\ncourt as a litigant, that each time consumers\n\nwere harmed they would have the opportunity to\n\nget redress for their victimization.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n45\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now I\u0027m following","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"40","file_name":"AMG Capital Management, LLC v.
