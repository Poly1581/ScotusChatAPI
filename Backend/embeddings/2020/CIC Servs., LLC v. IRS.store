While these\n\nrequirements are enforced in part by tax\n\npenalties, CIC does not challenge the penalties,\n\nthe IRS has not assessed any penalties, and CIC\n\nis a law-abiding company that will never incur\n\nany penalties.\n\nAt most, an order setting aside the\n\nnotice would prevent the IRS from collecting\n\nfuture tax penalties if someone someday decided\n\nto violate the reporting requirements.

and get your reaction.\n\nSo, on the tax, I see this as a\n\nSubchapter 68 penalty that, therefore, qualifies\n\nas a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction\n\nAct.\n\nOn Direct Marketing, it seems

Subject to Final Review\n\nrelief it seeks would legally bar the IRS from\n\ncollecting a tax, regardless of the plaintiff\u0027s\n\nobjective or motive for bringing suit, as I\n\nunderstand Petitioner now to acknowledge.\n\nThe second unambiguous provision is\n\n6671, which provides that penalties imposed in\n\nsubchapter 68(b) are treated as taxes. And by\n\nfar, the most important consequence of that\n\nprovision is that 68(b) penalties are subject to\n\nthe AIA, which precludes pre-enforcement review\n\nand instead channels disputes to refund suits.\n\nTogether, those two provisions resolve\n\nthis case because Petitioner\u0027s complaint on its\n\nface at page 16 seeks to enjoin the enforcement\n\nof reporting requirements that are enforced by\n\n68(b) penalties.\n\nPetitioner leans heavily on a third\n\nprovision, Section 7203, which makes certain\n\nwillful violations a misdemeanor and which it\n\nsays requires committing a crime to obtain\n\njudicial review.  But Petitioner misreads that\n\nprovision, which does not criminalize the very\n\navenue of review this Court commended 93 years\n\nago in Sullivan and has reaffirmed since, of\n\nfiling a timely return that asserts a good faith\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n33\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nobjection to reporting certain information in\n\norder to obtain review.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2020","index":"28","file_name":"CIC Servs., LLC v.

I mean,\n\ncalling something a tax doesn\u0027t make it one.\n\nThere are still differences.  And one of the\n\ndifferences, they say, is this:  If the IRS\n\ntells me I owe some money, I pay it, but I can\n\nget it back.  If the IRS -- if it -- if it\u0027s\n\nillegal.\n\nIf the IRS here tells me spend\n\n$100,000 gathering this information and give it\n\nto them, I can\u0027t get that money back.

If I think about this lawsuit, it seems\n\nto me that the relief that\u0027s being requested is\n\nthe invalidation of a reporting requirement.\n\nNow it\u0027s true that if it\u0027s successful\n\nin invalidating a reporting requirement, then\n\nyou don\u0027t get to enforce that reporting\n\nrequirement through a tax penalty.\n\nBut the more simple way of thinking\n\nabout this suit, and I think truly what\n\nplaintiffs here are doing, is to say they\u0027re\n\ntrying to invalidate a demand that they disclose\n\ninformation.\n\nSo how does that fit under the AIA?\n\nMR.
