MURPHY: So I still think that\n\neven if under the -- taking the Second\n\nCircuit\u0027s premise as a given, which is this is\n\njust one market, we disagree. We think that\n\nthat market analysis should be divided\n\nseparately.\n\nBut even taking their argument as a\n\npremise, their argument is that they can\n\nrestrict competition with respect to one\n\nproduct attribute in order to channel it to\n\nother product attributes.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s fundamentally\n\ninconsistent with this Court\u0027s cases under\n\nSection 1, which say that competition should\n\nprovide what is the appropriate ratio between\n\nthese things. I\u0027ll give you an example.\n\nIn the Indiana Dental case, a dentist\n\nrefused to provide X-rays to insurers and the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n15\n\nOfficial\n\ndentist\u0027s argument was that this restriction on\n\nthe provision of X-rays would improve quality\n\nof patient care.\n\nThe Court rejected that argument.

are perfectly\n\nbenign, which is exactly what happened here\n\nwith respect to the merchant fees because they\n\nwere fueling price decreases to the consumers.\n\nEvery reward, every seat on a plane to\n\nAruba, every ticket to a Billy Joel concert,\n\nevery cash back reward that\u0027s given, is a price\n\ndiscount to the consumer. And what the\n\ndistrict court found here is nobody proved to\n\nme what that price is for the product at issue.\n\nSo the result that we\u0027re trying to\n\navoid here is a situation in which a plaintiff\n\ncan fail to prove what the price of the product\n\nis, merely that there\u0027s been an increase to\n\npart of that price, and that that\u0027s enough to\n\nsatisfy the first leg of the rule of reason.\n\nAnd the burden then falls to the defendant to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n60\n\nOfficial\n\ndisprove what the plaintiff has failed to\n\nprove.
