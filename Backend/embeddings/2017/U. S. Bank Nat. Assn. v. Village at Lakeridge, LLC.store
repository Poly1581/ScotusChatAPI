And it\u0027s\n\nnot your fault that the two are hard to\n\nseparate because we took one question and we\n\ndidn\u0027t take the other.\n\nBut the issue here is what is the\n\nstandard of appellate review with respect to\n\nthe standard that was applied by the Ninth\n\nCircuit. I take it that is the question. And\n\nthe Ninth Circuit standard has two components.\n\nOne is whether it was an arm\u0027s length\n\ntransaction.\n\nAnd if the definition of an arm\u0027s\n\nlength transaction is the one that Justice\n\nGinsburg mentioned, which I think comes right\n\nout of Black\u0027s Law Dictionary, is it the kind\n\nof transaction in which strangers would engage?\n\nIsn\u0027t that a -- a question of fact?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n15\n\nOfficial\n\nIsn\u0027t that very close to a question of pure\n\nfact?\n\nMR.

the Court could clearly articulate\n\nbasic principles and guides that would allow\n\nthis statutory measure to have greater clarity.\n\nI articulated the four. And with respect to\n\ncloseness, the nature of the relationships and\n\ndefining the categories of the relationships,\n\nsaying they were a romantic relationship is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the presumption so that\n\nyou\u0027re going to take a closer look, that\u0027s an\n\nappellate role. That\u0027s an easy call. We do\n\nnot need to get down into the weeds of how many\n\ndates did they have. Did they live together?\n\nThat -- that is not necessary. But a\n\ngeneralized principle would give sufficient\n\nguidance, and that\u0027s what differentiates this.\n\nBut it\u0027s particularly important because we\u0027re\n\ninterpreting a statute.\n\nIf there are no further questions, I\u0027d\n\nlike to reserve my remaining -- remaining time.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nMR.

So the -- the debate\n\nthis morning is about how do we understand the\n\nbankruptcy court\u0027s finding here that two\n\nparties operated at arm\u0027s length.\n\nThe government\u0027s position is not that\n\nbecause that is the test, that automatically is\n\nreviewed for clear error, as Petitioner\n\nsuggests. The government\u0027s position is that,\n\nbecause this is the type of test that is well\n\nestablished and is familiar and is asking for a\n\npure factual inference, that is -- that finding\n\nthat comes from that test will be reviewed for\n\nclear error.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that seems easier\n\nto say about the arm\u0027s length part of the test\n\nthan about the sufficiently close to a\n\nstatutory insider part.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n57\n\nOfficial\n\nMS.

things: first, as a\n\ngeneral matter as Respondents\u0027 counsel\n\nsuggested, how closeness is defined is so close\n\nthat you\u0027re not operating at arm\u0027s length.\n\nThat\u0027s how the court of appeals understood it\n\nat page 14 of the petition appendix and again\n\nat page 17 of the petition appendix.\n\nAnd so, if closeness ultimately just\n\ngets folded into the arm\u0027s length calculus,\n\nthen \"was this transaction at arm\u0027s length\" is\n\ngoing to be the ultimate determination in the\n\ncase. And that\u0027s consistent with how the\n\nleading bankruptcy court treatise discusses it.\n\nThat\u0027s consistent with how the parties argued\n\nthis case.\n\nAnd so I do think that the result of\n\nthat is that even if there might be more\n\nlegal-sounding questions with respect to\n\ncloseness, it\u0027s not really an independent prong\n\nof the test so much as folding into it.\n\nThe arm\u0027s length test itself is\n\ncomparable in some ways to this Court\u0027s\n\ndecision in Commissioner versus Duberstein, and\n\nthat case dealt with what is a gift for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\npurposes of the Tax Code?

distinguish between a material\n\nfact and a statutory fact.\n\nStatutes have to be\n\ngiven uniform application.\n\nNow what happened here is we allowed,\n\nthrough the absence of de novo review, the\n\nbankruptcy court to develop its own test. The\n\nbankruptcy court did not solve for totality of\n\ncircumstances here.\n\nThe bankruptcy court went out,\n\nsurveyed the other courts and said these five\n\nfactors are determinative of insider status.\n\nThat\u0027s what occurred.\n\nNow, in Miller, I don\u0027t usually read\n\nquotes, but I think this quote is right on. In\n\nMiller, the Court wrote, \"When relevant legal\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n70\n\nOfficial\n\nprinciples can be given meaning through the\n\napplication of particular circumstances of a\n\ncase, the Court has been reluctant to give the\n\ntrier of fact\u0027s conclusions presumptive force\n\nand, in so doing, stripped the federal court of\n\nits primary function as an expositor of the\n\nlaw.\" That\u0027s exactly what the appellate court\n\ndid here.\n\nIt abdicated its responsibility to\n\nenunciate clear standards and to give meaning\n\nto the insider status by the exercise of clear\n\nerror review. This should have been decided by\n\nde novo review.\n\nIf there are no further questions,\n\nI\u0027ll submit the case.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel. The case is submitted.\n\n(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case\n\nwas submitted.)","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"61","file_name":"U.
