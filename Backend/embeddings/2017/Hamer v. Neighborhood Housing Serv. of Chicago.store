ALITO: And why is that?\n\nMR.\n\nHERSTOFF: It stems from a long\n\nline of this Court\u0027s cases, such as Kontrick,\n\nand it also stems from Article III of the\n\nConstitution, which says that it\u0027s for Congress\n\nto establish the lower courts. So -­\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have drawn the\n\nline, I think it was in Justice Thomas\u0027s\n\ndecision, between statute and rule pretty\n\nclearly.\n\nMR. HERSTOFF: Yes, Justice Ginsburg,\n\nBowles versus Russell establishes that and\n\nKontrick versus Ryan establishes it, and cases\n\nas far back as the 1940s and perhaps even\n\nearlier have also said that court-promulgated\n\nrules cannot be jurisdictional.
