CORKRAN: Yeah. So I\u0027m going to\n\nattempt to answer that concisely with the\n\ncaveat that it would take an entire second set\n\nof briefs to adequately address the nuances of\n\nthe Court\u0027s grand jury jurisprudence, which is\n\nwhy neither we nor the government attempted\n\nthat. This is just a very different and more\n\ncomplicated question, but my -- my best simple\n\nanswer is that Hubbell and Counselman hold that\n\nthe clause applies to grand injuries.\n\nWith this added limitation from Lawn,\n\nCalandra, and Williams, the courts don\u0027t have\n\nauthority to crack open indictments because of\n\nthe grand jury\u0027s status as an independent\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial\n\nconstitutional fixture. It\u0027s not textually\n\nassigned to the judicial branch.\n\nThat said, courts do crack open\n\nindictments all the time. That\u0027s the whole\n\npoint of a Kastigar hearing. And when a court\n\nfinds that jury -- a grand jury has made use or\n\nderivative use of a compelled immunized\n\nstatement, the remedy is to dismiss the\n\nindictment itself unlawful. That is\n\nirreconcilable with Petitioner\u0027s theory that\n\nit\u0027s perfectly fine for the government to use\n\ncompelled statements all the way up to the\n\npoint of trial.\n\nSo, as a practical matter -­","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"43","file_name":"City of Hays v.

Alabama when it said\n\nthat the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\n\napplies to probable cause hearings, the exact\n\nsort of probable cause hearing we have at issue\n\nhere, even though that right does not apply to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n52\n\nOfficial\n\ngrand juries.\n\nAnd Justice White\u0027s concurrence made\n\nthe same ominous predictions about the death of\n\nprobable cause hearings that Petitioner has\n\nmade here, and it didn\u0027t happen. It\u0027s 48 years\n\nlater, and the vast majority of states are\n\nstill using probable cause hearings as the\n\nprimary mechanism for pursuing felony\n\nprosecutions, even though the right to counsel\n\nis surely more burdensome on the state than the\n\nself-incrimination privilege.\n\nSo I\u0027d like to go back to the Court\u0027s\n\nprecedent because I think this is important.\n\nNot once in the history of this country has\n\nthis Court relied on the term \"witness against\n\nitself\" -- \"himself\" to limit when the use of a\n\ncompelled incriminating testimonial statement\n\nviolates the clause.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is your\n\ntest for determining whether a proceeding is","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"45","file_name":"City of Hays v.

What the Court held in\n\nEstelle was that the defendant\u0027s rights had\n\nbeen violated by the use of his psychiatric\n\nexam at his sentencing proceeding. So that\n\nholding in itself forecloses the notion that\n\nthe clause is only a trial right.\n\nWhat Petitioner and the government are\n\nlatching onto are two sentences of dicta where\n\nthe Court said: Well, if the psychiatric exam\n\nhad been limited to its function of determining\n\nwhether the defendant understood the charges\n\nagainst him and was capable of assisting in his\n\nown defense, then a Fifth Amendment problem\n\nwouldn\u0027t have arose.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"46","file_name":"City of Hays v.

HEYTENS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. HEYTENS: I\u0027d just like to make\n\nthree quick points in rebuttal: One in\n\nresponse to Justice Kagan\u0027s point about the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n71\n\nOfficial\n\napparent oddity with regard to this particular\n\nproceeding, one about suppression hearings, and\n\none about Garrity.\n\nSo, in response to Justice Kagan\u0027s\n\nquestions about the oddity of this particular\n\ntype of hearing, I think beyond the fact that\n\nthe Supreme Court of Kansas has held that the\n\npurpose of this hearing is not to adjudicate\n\nguilt or punishment, I think an even more\n\nimportant indication of that is that, under\n\nKansas law, nothing that happened at this\n\nhearing could conclusively resolve Officer\n\nVogt\u0027s guilt or innocence one way or the other.\n\nAnd the way -- the reason that we know that is\n\nbecause the Supreme Court has specifically held\n\nthat the dismissal of charges after a probable\n\ncause hearing is not preclusive of, and without\n\nprejudice to, the state\u0027s ability to reinitiate\n\nthe exact same criminal prosecution.\n\nWhich is the same rule for grand","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"62","file_name":"City of Hays v.

This hearing\n\ndoes not adjudicate guilt or innocence.\n\nThe point on suppression hearings, I\n\nthink it\u0027s just worth emphasizing again in\n\nresponse to Justice Ginsburg\u0027s point, we are\n\nnot talking about the possibility that someone\n\nwill have to decide to plead guilty without\n\nbeing able to challenge evidence for one very\n\nsimple reason: They can file a pretrial motion\n\nto suppress.\n\nMany -- it is true that a large\n\nmajority of prosecutions are resolved via\n\nguilty plea. But it is also true that before\n\npleading guilty, defendants often file pretrial\n\nmotions to suppress and only plead guilty after\n\nthe denial of their motion to suppress.\n\nIn the federal system, they are even\n\nsometimes permitted to file a conditional\n\nguilty plea to preserve their ability to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"63","file_name":"City of Hays v.

I understand that, in Chavez, the\n\nCourt was deeply divided about whether there\n\nwere circumstances in which an involuntariness\n\nclaim could occur before trial. But, as I\n\nunderstood, even some of the dissenting\n\njustices in Chavez said a Miranda claim is\n\nsomething that can only accrue until trial.\n\nAnd I think that would make sense when\n\nit comes to Garrity claims.
