The problem here is this\n\nstatute just goes too far.\n\nThe appropriate result in this case is\n\nto invalidate the third sentence of the\n\nstatute, give the Minnesota legislature another\n\nchance to draw up -- draw up a more narrowly\n\ndrawn statute if it wants to continue to have\n\nan apparel ban.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel. The case is submitted.\n\n(Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in\n\nthe above-entitled matter was submitted.)\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n71\nOfficial\n�","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"62","file_name":"Minnesota Voters Alliance v.
