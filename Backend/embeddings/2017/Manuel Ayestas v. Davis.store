It\u0027s just that the\n\n14 referenced issue can\u0027t be intertwined with the\n\n15 evidence that the inmate is seeking in the\n\n16 motion.\n\n17 So take the following example. A\n\n18 claim has two elements, element A and element\n\n19 B. And the record is fully developed with\n\n20 respect to element A, and the record is not\n\n21 going to get any better with respect to element\n\n22 A. And the inmate comes to court under 3599\n\n23 and asks for resources to develop element B.\n\n24 A court can decide the 3599 motion by\n\n25 reference to the merits if what it\u0027s doing is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n21\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"17","file_name":"Manuel Ayestas v.

No, there isn\u0027t.\n\nThe review is -- concerns the\n\n9 amount of the funds.\n\nAnd here it strikes me\n\n10 that what we\u0027re dealing with is a simple\n\n11 question of statutory interpretation, what does\n\n12 13 -- 3599(f) require counsel to show to get\n\n13 funds for investigating the existence of a\n\n14 mitigation case?\n\n15 That sounds to me like a legal\n\n16 question, the kind of question that is fit for\n\n17 a court, not an administrative review.\n\n18 MR.

not, did they talk to\n\n16 this person or not, how much did -- it strikes\n\n17 me that those are the sorts of things that\n\n18 would be very hard for a court in the normal -Â­\n\n19 an appellate

They\u0027re much more\n\n25 familiar than we are with how these sorts of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n55\n\nOfficial\n\n1 mitigation investigations are conducted.
