It\u0027s contrary\n\nto how this Court has applied Marks. And it\n\nundercuts the principle of vertical stare\n\ndecisis that generally requires lower courts to\n\ndecide cases in the way that this Court would\n\ndecide them.\n\nNow I take Petitioner to raise two\n\nmain objections to that. The first is an\n\nargument that Marks, as this Court has\n\ndeveloped it, requires considering dissents.\n\nI do want to make clear that\u0027s only\n\ntrue in a limited sense. When this Court\n\napplies the Marks doctrine, it\u0027s picking one of\n\nthe opinions that led to the judgment in the\n\ncase at hand and treating that judgment -­\n\ntreating that opinion as controlling.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\nSo it\u0027s -- the Marks -­","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"25","file_name":"Hughes v.
