With regard to a divorce, I agree with\n\nyou that I don\u0027t think that just giving the\n\nmoney to a charity or to the government could\n\nconceivably be deemed as an exercise of\n\npreexisting police power, because, at the time\n\nMark Sveen bought his policy, a divorce court\n\ncouldn\u0027t just randomly take the parties\u0027 assets\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\nand give it to the government to discourage\n\ndivorce or something.

That is the\n\ncase involving the bond and the -- the\n\nretroactive -- the retroactive change there.\n\nThe Court went out of its way in the\n\nGilfillan opinion to point out that the -- the\n\nbond contract there was a particular kind of\n\ncontract in which bondholders effectively\n\nassume obligations to one another.\n\nIt\u0027s a type of contract where there is\n\nlike a good -- a duty of good faith and fair\n\ndealing to your co-bondholders. That\u0027s very\n\ndifferent than our case, where the policyholder\n\nhas a direct and explicit assurance about the\n\nbeneficiary designation.\n\nSo there\u0027s a difference in the -- in\n\nthe nature of the impairment.\n\nMoreover, in the Gilfillan case, the\n\nCourt also focused on the practicalities and\n\nwhether or not it was still reasonably possible\n\nfor the bondholder to protect his original\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"39","file_name":"Sveen v.

The statute doesn\u0027t even do\n\nanything until the divorce happens.\n\nAnd I think that reliance is important\n\nto the Contracts Clause because that\u0027s why the\n\nclause distinguishes between statutes passed\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n73\n\nOfficial\n\nbefore and after a contract, because of the\n\nrecognition that the contract itself generates\n\nreliance interests.\n\nAnd so, therefore, if -- it\u0027s\n\nessentially undisputed that reliance interests\n\nreally come into play at the time of the\n\ndivorce rather than at the time of contracting,\n\nit\u0027s just not an impairment of contractual\n\nobligations in the relevant sense.\n\nThe only thing that would be impaired\n\n-- the only reliance expectations that would be\n\nimpaired are those of Mark Sveen, who might not\n\nbe able to get the proceeds, or who might not\n\nbe able to distribute the proceeds as he\n\nintended.\n\nThank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel. The case is submitted.\n\n(Whereupon, 11:06 a.m., the hearing\n\nconcluded.)\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n74\nOfficial\n�\n\n1 \n1 [1] 34:8\n\n10 [1] 49:12\n\n10:05 [2] 1:14 4:2\n\n100 [1] 47:1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"66","file_name":"Sveen v.
