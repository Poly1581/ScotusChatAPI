JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear\n\nargument first this morning in Case 15-1439,\n\nCyan versus Beaver County Employees Retirement\n\nFund.\n\nMr. Katyal.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nCongress in 1998 reacted to a new\n\nproblem. After its 1995 Reform Act, which\n\ndealt with the crisis of abuse of federal\n\nclaims in federal court, plaintiffs had\n\nresponded by shifting their litigation to state\n\ncourt. The upshot was that the pre-\u002795 abuses\n\nwere happening; they were just happening in\n\nstate court.\n\nCongress, in the Securities Litigation\n\nUniform Standards Act, SLUSA, took three steps.\n\nFirst, it precluded certain causes of action.\n\nSecond, it modified its anti-removal bar. And,\n\nthird, it eliminated concurrent jurisdiction\n\nfor many \u002733 Act federal claims in state court.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nRespondents disagree with this third\n\none, but the text, structure, and purpose are\n\nall against them. And the best way of\n\nunderstanding our argument is this: If Beaver\n\nCounty brought the exact same complaint that\n\nthey did here, alleging a federal \u002733 Act\n\nclaim, but did one thing differently, they also\n\nbrought a state law claim, they\u0027d be knocked\n\nout of state court. That\u0027s their own reading.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"2","file_name":"Cyan, Inc. v.

Justice Sotomayor, you\u0027re\n\nright to say that under our reading the except\n\n-- the jurisdiction that is ousted of the state\n\ncourt is greater than what is precluded by\n\nCongress. That was intentional. What I\u0027m\n\ntrying to say is that\u0027s exactly what happened\n\nin the \u002734 Act.

They\u0027re not\n\nSecurities Act actions.\n\nAnd for that, Congress did everything\n\nit wanted because Exchange Act actions are all\n\nin the federal courts. There is exclusive\n\njurisdiction there.\n\nSo essentially what was happening was\n\nthat in Exchange Act actions, it -- that\n\nexclusive jurisdiction was being compromised by\n\nthe ability of people to bring state law\n\nactions.\n\nAnd Congress completely shut that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n19\n\nOfficial\n\ndown.

My textual question is that\n\nwhat I think your argument, but perhaps not the\n\ngovernment\u0027s argument, requires us to read c in\n\na pretty unnatural way, that\u0027s -- that\u0027s p(c),\n\nsee, because it says \"as set forth in\n\nsubsection (b).\"\n\nSo what you want us to do is to look\n\nat subsection (b) and you -- take that as\n\nreferring to -- which is possible, but it\u0027s\n\ntough -- not having the words \"based upon\n\nstatutory or common law of any state.\"\n\nYou see, because -- because if it -­\n\nif it picks that up, well, then -- then all\n\nwe\u0027re talking about is those actions that have\n\nthe state action within it are removable, which\n\nexplains the anomaly that you started out with\n\nand it would just be an anomaly and you\u0027d say,\n\nwell, it isn\u0027t a practical anomaly because no\n\nsensible lawyer is going to include the state\n\none anymore. He\u0027ll just include the \u002733 one.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"20","file_name":"Cyan, Inc. v.
