HO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\n\nplease the Court:\n\nFor 400 years, courts have adjudicated\n\ndisputes between private parties about the\n\nvalidity of patents. Six years ago, Congress\n\ntransferred this judicial power to an executive\n\nbranch tribunal that is unusual because of five\n\nfeatures.\n\nFirst, it exercises the judicial\n\npower; second, in disputes between private\n\nparties; third, over private rights; fourth,\n\nwithout both Article III supervision and\n\nconsent; and, fifth, about questions\n\nadjudicated in courts for 400 years.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Ho, you\n\noutlined your position, but there must be some\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nmeans by which the Patent Office can correct\n\nthe errors that it\u0027s made, like missing prior\n\nart that would be preclusive.\n\nSo, do you recognize any error\n\ncorrection mechanism as within Article III?\n\nMS. HO: Yes, certainly, Justice\n\nGinsburg. And -- and our position -- our\n\nposition is not that the PTO is precluded from\n\nerror correction. It simply can\u0027t do it\n\nthrough this adjudication.\n\nSo, for example, we believe ex parte\n\nreexams, which are fundamentally examinational\n\nand not adjudicational in nature, are perfectly\n\nconsistent with Article III.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"2","file_name":"Oil States Energy Services, LLC v.

The first is, even though the firing\n\nwould have to comply with the Due Process\n\nClause, there\u0027s no rule that it could only be\n\ndone by an Article III court.

And so that would get the PTO much\n\nmore out of its usual bailiwick and much more\n\ninto the business that is usually performed by\n\ncourts.\n\nAnd the second is there\u0027s no\n\nhistorical tradition of non-Article III federal\n\nadjudication.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there\u0027s no\n\nhistorical tradition here, except the\n\ninterference actions, up until 1981, of the PTO\n\ncanceling issued patents.\n\nMR.
