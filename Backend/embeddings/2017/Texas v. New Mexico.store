Second, that Project is a\n\nnecessary predicate for the compact\u0027s equitable\n\napportionment, to quote Nebraska versus\n\nWyoming. And, third, that Project is the sole\n\nmeans to actually distribute the equitable\n\napportionment to Texas.\n\nAnd so, to put it succinctly and quote\n\nthe Special Master, the signatory states\n\nintended to use the Project as the vehicle to\n\nguarantee delivery of Texas\u0027s equitable\n\napportionment.
