ZIMMER: So, yes, the date\n\ncertainly can be changed, and yes -- and yes,\n\nit is better to include a date in the initial\n\nnotice anyway. And let me give three reasons\n\nwhy that\u0027s true.\n\nThe first is that requiring the\n\ngovernment to include a date ensures that when\n\nthe time is stopped, when the immigrant is\n\nprevented from accruing additional time, the\n\ngovernment is actually serious about proceeding\n\nwith -- with a -- with a removal proceeding, of\n\ngoing forward with the proceeding.\n\nAnd if you look at a case like\n\nCamarillo, you can see why that\u0027s important,\n\nwhere the government served one of these\n\nnotices that did not include the time and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial\n\nplace, and then just sat on it for over two\n\nyears without doing anything at all.\n\nAnd it\u0027s totally reasonable that in\n\nthat context Congress thought that that time\n\nshould continue to accrue on behalf of the\n\nimmigrant.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don\u0027t see how","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"11","file_name":"Fonseca Pereira v.
