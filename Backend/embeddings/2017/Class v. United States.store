Well, Your Honor, a\n\nfactual response to that and then a legal\n\nresponse.\n\nThe factual response is that if you\n\nread the remainder of the sentence, which is on\n\nJoint Appendix 63, the Court says if you\n\nbelieve your plea was somehow unlawful or\n\ninvoluntary or if there is some other\n\nfundamental defect in these guilty plea\n\nproceedings, I think it\u0027s properly understood\n\nto go to the kinds of procedural claims that\n\neveryone understands you can bring after a\n\nguilty plea, such as that your plea was not\n\nknowing and intelligent.\n\nThe Court again -- and this is on

Because\n\nwhat Rule 11 does, if you just look at the text\n\nof Rule 11, it says here are the conditions in\n\nwhich you can enter a conditional guilty plea,\n\nyou know, you have to get some consents, and\n\nthen you can enter a conditional guilty plea.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t say what happens if you\n\ndon\u0027t do that. There\u0027s nothing in Rule 11 that\n\nsays and the consequence of not entering a\n\nconditional guilty plea is X, Y, Z.\n\nSo you have to look outside the rule\n\nfor the consequence of not entering a\n\nconditional guilty plea. And it seems to me\n\nthat the place you look, the question you ask\n\nis, well, what\u0027s the inherent effect of that\n\nguilty plea?\n\nSo Rule 11 just tells you, you know,\n\ngo try to figure out what the inherent effect\n\nof the guilty plea is, and what\u0027s covered by\n\nit, and, on the other hand, what\u0027s not.\n\nSo I don\u0027t see how Rule 11 really is\n\nthe answer to this question.
