We are not asking the\n\nCourt to overturn those older cases. We think\n\nthat the -- the lesson to be drawn from Riley\n\nand Jones and Kyllo is that any extension of\n\npre-digital precedents to these kinds of\n\ndigital data must rest on their own bottom.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: How would you\n\ndistinguish Miller?\n\nMR.

this Court held, they were\n\nvoluntarily conveyed in that they were created\n\nby the passing of negotiable instruments into\n\nthe stream of commerce to transfer funds.\n\nWhat we have here is both

WESSLER: Justice Kagan, so on the\n\nfirst point, we agree that, as of 2010 and 2011\n\nwhere the records in this case come from, they\n\nwere generally less precise than the GPS data\n\nin Jones, but we don\u0027t think that that makes a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n29\n\nOfficial\n\ndifference for the Fourth Amendment rule for a\n\nfew reasons.\n\nFirst, to go to the second part of\n\nyour -- your question, even in Jones, the data\n\nlacked precision. It was accurate only to\n\nwithin 50 to 100 feet and only tracked where a\n\ncar went. So, if a person parks in a parking\n\nlot or on a street, that GPS data by itself\n\ncan\u0027t tell if they go to a jewelry store for a\n\nstick-up or a medical clinic for a checkup or a\n\ncafe to meet with a friend. Some other amount\n\nof evidence or inference was required. That\n\nmakes it no less a search in that the same is\n\ntrue here.\n\nNow, in the intervening seven years,\n\nthe data has become markedly more precise.

You know,\n\nthe facts here wind up looking a lot like\n\nJones.\n\nOne thing Jones -- Jones taught us is\n\n-- and reminded us, really, is that the\n\nproperty-based approach to privacy also has to\n\nbe considered, not just the reasonable\n\nexpectation approach.\n\nSo, if we put aside the reasonable\n\nexpectation approach for just a moment, Katz,\n\nMiller, Smith, and ask what is the property\n\nright here, let\u0027s say there is a property\n\nright. Let\u0027s say I have a property right in\n\nthe conversion case I posited with your\n\ncolleague, so that if someone were to steal my\n\nlocation information from T-Mobile I\u0027d have a\n\nconversion claim, for example, against them for\n\nthe economic value that was stolen.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2017","index":"44","file_name":"Carpenter v.
