And \"sufficient\n\nbut not greater than necessary\" necessarily\n\nmeans that there is a sentence that is\n\nsufficient but not greater than necessary.  If\n\none -- if 10 months is sufficient, 15 months is\n\nobviously greater.  So, by asking the court for\n\na particular sentence, the party puts the\n\ndistrict court on notice of their objections to\n\nany other sentence.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"4","file_name":"Holguin-Hernandez v.

So, again, we think the\n\nbetter view of Section 3553(a) is that it really\n\ninstructs the district court to identify a\n\nparticular sentence, and so, by identifying a\n\nparticular sentence, the defendant necessarily\n\ncommunicates that other sentences -- that he\n\ndoesn\u0027t agree with other sentences.\n\nAnd while it\u0027s true that a defendant\n\nmight not have identified every factor

Remember, my rule\n\nhas two points: One is you have to make the\n\ndistinct legal argument that an imposed sentence\n\nis beyond the range of permissible choice; and\n\nthen two is you have to state the facts and\n\ncircumstances.\n\nThe government agrees with part 2.  So\n\nreally all it is, I think, is my requirement to\n\nrequire some more specificity that, hey, I\u0027m\n\nraising the grounds for a substantive\n\nreasonableness argument as opposed to just\n\nsimply asking for a shorter sentence.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  So if --\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And you --\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Please.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Go ahead.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  No, go ahead.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Go ahead.\n\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  This outside the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n43","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"38","file_name":"Holguin-Hernandez v.
