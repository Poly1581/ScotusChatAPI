Today, Florida\n\nis the only state lacking a guilty knowledge\n\nelement. Florida\u0027s law is an aberration.\n\nThe question here is whether Congress\n\nintended convictions under such an aberrational\n\nlaw to support the extreme sentencing\n\nenhancement of up to life in prison under ACCA.\n\nThe answer is no for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, the state offense provision\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npresents a list of generic crimes which all\n\ninclude a mens rea element.\n\nSecond, the text of the state offense\n\nprovision itself implies a mens rea element\n\nirrespective of any generic offense analysis.\n\nThird, Congress described the\n\nqualifying state offenses by tracking almost\n\nverbatim the language of the federal drug\n\ntrafficking statute. Congress used the same\n\nterms and even in the same order as the federal\n\nstatute. We know that when Congress transplants\n\nlanguage from one legal source to another, the\n\nlanguage carries the old soil with it. And here\n\nthe old soil includes a mens rea element.\n\nWhile tracking the federal statute,\n\nCongress used the term \"involving\" to sweep in\n\nsimilar crimes described with different\n\nterminology, such as promoting, producing, or\n\nfurnishing a controlled substance.

Here we have a phrase\n\n\"manufacturing, distribution, possession with\n\nintent to manufacture or distribute a controlled\n\nsubstance.\" This phrase incorporates well-known\n\ndrug trafficking crimes under the federal code.\n\nAnd virtually identical language is used to\n\ndescribe the -- the -- the drug trafficking\n\ncrime -- crimes under the Uniform Controlled\n\nSubstances Act.\n\nIn 1986, Congress knew that every\n\nstate had adopted the Uniform Act to a\n\nsubstantial degree. It is only natural,\n\ntherefore, that Congress would use this same\n\nlanguage to identify drug trafficking offenses\n\nand not discrete conduct or activities under the\n\nstate offense provision.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO: The difference between\n\nthe Florida statute and the federal statute, as\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"3","file_name":"Shular v.
