PHILIP J. WEISER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. WEISER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Constitution authorizes states to\n\nuse their plenary authority to remove a bribed\n\nelector, one who engages in a rebellion, or one\n\nwho would perpetrate a bait and switch on the\n\npeople of their state by voting contrary to a\n\nbinding pledge.  By contrast, if a state wishes\n\nto treat electors as free agents, rather than as\n\nproxy voters, it is free to do so.\n\nIn short, states determine how to\n\nselect electors and ensure that they meet the\n\nrelevant requirements and perform their duties\n\nas assigned.  This means, under Green, that\n\nstates can oversee bribery as an incident as a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npower to appoint.  This must include the power\n\nto remove an elector without requiring a full\n\ncriminal trial.  Under my friend Mr. Lessig\u0027s\n\nposition, as a practicality, bribed electors\n\nwould cast ballots and illegal votes.\n\nIn this case, the State prevented\n\nMr. Baca from casting a legal ballot, just like\n\nit\u0027s an illegal ballot if you don\u0027t sign it here\n\nin Colorado.\n\nAs this Court explained in Ray, the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Colorado Dept. of State v.

WEISER: Your Honor, here in\n\nColorado, we picked electors in 1976.  The state\n\nlegislature did it directly.  As long as that\n\nchoice doesn\u0027t violate a constitutional\n\nprovision, they can pick whoever they want.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the\n\nrule is, you know, the electors are chosen\n\npursuant to slates, but anyone who says anything\n\ndisloyal to the State between the time they\u0027re\n\nselected and the time they cast their vote will\n\nbe replaced?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"4","file_name":"Colorado Dept. of State v.

WEISER: Your Honor, we disagree.\n\nThe Constitution clearly gives states plenary\n\npower over electors and as -- acting as a\n\nsteward of the presidential election system.\n\nThat means, if electors were to take a\n\nbribe, for example, or not to show up, it\u0027s on\n\nthe State to address that point. If you only\n\nleft this to Congress in the final instance,\n\nthat would mean that all Congress could do is\n\nremove the elector, not have it be counted.\n\nWhat the states can do is replace an\n\nelector and make sure that the state has the\n\nconstitutionally authorized votes in the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"6","file_name":"Colorado Dept. of State v.

Let me first answer your\n\nquestion, then get to a slightly different one\n\nthat raises the same concern.\n\nIf the legislature announces the\n\nprocedure in advance and gives people the right\n\nto vote and they exercise that right, the\n\nlegislature cannot undo the public\u0027s right to\n\nvote without violating the right-to-vote line of\n\ncases.\n\nHowever, if the legislature acted\n\nearlier, say the prior spring, to change the\n\nprocess to give itself the power to appoint\n\nelectors, not the power in the hands of the\n\npeople, that\u0027s a choice state legislatures could\n\nmake.\n\nIn McPherson, it was litigated whether\n\nor not a legislature could move from a\n\nwinner-take-all to a districting system.  There\n\nwas a partisan motivation for that change, and\n\nthe Court said the legislature\u0027s power was\n\nplenary.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we agree with\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"15","file_name":"Colorado Dept. of State v.

WEISER: Thank you for that\n\nquestion, Justice Kavanaugh.  When electors are\n\nset up in the constitutional design, that allows\n\nfor states to make a choice.  Electors can\n\neither vote as proxy voters on behalf of the\n\npublic, as we do here in Colorado, or they can\n\nbe free agents.\n\nBy having this structure uniform\n\nacross the several states, you give states the\n\nability to choose which model they want.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But wouldn\u0027t -- if\n\nthat were the design, why not just leave it to\n\nthe states, as opposed to going through all\n\nthese details about how the electors are\n\nsupposed to operate?\n\nAs you know, Justice Jackson in Ray,\n\nlooking at that history, said no one faithful to\n\nour history can deny that the plan originally\n\ncontemplated was that electors would be free\n\nagents to exercise an independent and\n\nnonpartisan judgment as to the people best","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"24","file_name":"Colorado Dept. of State v.

By contrast to what Justice\n\nJackson said, James Madison said the Electoral\n\nCollege was all about giving the states\n\nauthority to oversee presidential elections as\n\nthey saw fit.\n\nAnd as the majority in Ray noted,\n\ncontemporaries of the founders did, indeed, see\n\nelectors as proxy voters on behalf of the\n\npublic.  And that was absolutely the backdrop to\n\nthe Twelfth Amendment, so I would also point you\n\nto the Twelfth Amendment, as effectively\n\nconfirming and accepting the fact that electors\n\ncan be, indeed, most often are, proxy voters,\n\nnot free agents.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why do you think\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"25","file_name":"Colorado Dept. of State v.

HARROW: Justice Ginsburg, the\n\nstates do have great flexibility, as you\n\nmentioned, in choosing the mode and method of\n\nappointment, but the laws that they\u0027ve written\n\nhere, the laws that were enforced against my\n\nclient, Mike Baca, were -- are very rigid.  They\n\nare rigid in the sense that there are no\n\nexceptions once passed.\n\nAnd that rigidity conflicts with the\n\nsupposition that every single Congress that has\n\nlooked at the issue of presidential selection\n\nhas assumed exists, explicitly in 1933 with the\n\nCongress drafting the Twentieth Amendment,\n\nthat\u0027s a -- a key oversight of these laws, but\n\neven down to the more modern era when Congress\n\nwas debating the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, for\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n41\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ninstance, forbidding poll taxes, and noted that\n\nit needed to bar poll taxes for elections for\n\npresidential electors, because they still exist","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"35","file_name":"Colorado Dept. of State v.

PHILIP J. WEISER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. WEISER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.  Let me make three points in response\n\nand offer two closing thoughts.\n\nFirst off, on standing, the payment or\n\nnon-payment of the per diem fee was never before\n\nalleged, and any reported non-payment is not in\n\nthe record.\n\nSecond, on nominal damages, prior\n\ncases like Smith and Bird did not accord\n\nstanding on nominal damages alone, instead\n\nfocusing on whether there\u0027s an actual personal\n\ninjury.\n\nSecond, as to Justice Scalia\u0027s\n\nimportant point about congressional remover --\n\nremoval in the case of bribery, it\u0027s worth\n\nnoting there is a prescribed removal process for\n\nsenators, as Justice Alito noted.  In the case\n\nof electors, there\u0027s no such process, which\n\nmeans this Court\u0027s default rule controls.  The\n\npower to remove is thus incident to the power to\n\nappoint.\n\nThird, it\u0027s worth noting this is the\n\nfirst time we\u0027ve seen an elector who violated a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nstate binding law.
