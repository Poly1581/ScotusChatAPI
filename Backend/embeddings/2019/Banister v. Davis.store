BURGESS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThe Fifth Circuit\u0027s decision should be\n\nreversed for either of two independent reasons.\n\nFirst, a Rule 59(e) motion filed within 20 days\n\nof judgment is part of the first full\n\nopportunity to pursue habeas relief.  It is not\n\na second habeas application.\n\nIn the 50 years between Rule 59\u0027s\n\nadoption and AEDPA\u0027s enactment, there is no\n\nrecord of a court ever treating a timely Rule 59\n\nmotion merely seeking reconsideration as though\n\nit were a second habeas application.  AEDPA did\n\nnot change this settled practice, and nothing in\n\nthis Court\u0027s Gonzalez decision suggests\n\notherwise.\n\nRule 60(b) motions present obvious\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nopportunities to circumvent AEDPA\u0027s\n\nrestrictions, as the facts in Gonzalez itself\n\nwell illustrate.  There, the motion was filed\n\nyears after the judgment and well after the end\n\nof any appellate proceedings.\n\nRule 59(e) motions are different.\n\nThey have to be filed within 28 days of\n\njudgment, they suspend the judgment\u0027s finality,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Banister v.

HAWKINS: And in this case,\n\nJustice Ginsburg, it\u0027s true that the district\n\ncourt was able to dispose of that relatively\n\nquickly, but it\u0027s worth noting that Banister\u0027s\n\noriginal motions practice in district court\n\ntotaled almost a thousand pages of material,\n\nmuch of which was stylized as a stage play\n\ncomplete with stage directions.\n\nIf he\u0027d simply refiled that thousand\n\npages\u0027 worth of material stylized as a Rule\n\n59(e) motion, it likely would have taken the\n\ndistrict court much longer to go through that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\nand figure out whether there\u0027s any --\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Or it might have\n\ntaken the district court no time at all.  I\n\nmean, you -- you file a stylized play, a\n\nthousand pages of a stylized play, twice, I\n\nwould think the second time around, the district\n\ncourt might be righteously indignant and have\n\nvery little trouble denying that.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"28","file_name":"Banister v.

As the Court said in\n\nGonzalez, the question is whether the filing or\n\nthe submission contains one or more claims, so\n\nyou don\u0027t have to go through the entire\n\nsubmission and figure out is this a claim, is\n\nthat a claim?\n\nOnce you find one claim, then you have\n\nan application and it has to go through the\n\nsecond or successive bar.  The other thing that\n\nI\u0027d say about that is that my friend has\n\nsuggested that perhaps Rule 59 motions that\n\npresent or, excuse me, new claims would somehow\n\nbe treated differently from other Rule 59\n\nmotions.\n\nSo, once you make that concession, I\n\nthink the idea that their rule is a perfectly\n\nclear rule sort of goes out the window because\n\nyou\u0027re going to have to decide whether the\n\narguments that you\u0027re making on the Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion are so similar to the arguments that you\n\nmade before that --\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think their main\n\nargument was that would not be a proper 59(e)\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"51","file_name":"Banister v.

My friend\n\nfrom the United States was focusing on the test\n\nbeing -- whether there was a prior application\n\nfiled, but, as Justice Kagan pointed out, that\n\ncan\u0027t be the test because that would incorporate\n\namended complaints as well, and everyone agrees\n\nthat that would not count as a second habeas\n\napplication.\n\nThe fallback position that I think\n\nTexas has forcefully advocated is that it should\n\nbe the time of judgment. But that too is\n\ninconsistent with the structure of AEDPA\n\nbecause, in that, if you followed that logic, a\n\npetition for rehearing, which clearly is\n\nsomething that is in the appellate courts, which\n\nclearly is something that is filed after\n\njudgment, after the court of appeals has reached\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n61\n\nOfficial\n\na determination, is asking them to say, hey, you\n\ngot it wrong, we want you to revisit that, would\n\nnot -- would also be a habeas application.\n\nTheir answer to both of those points\n\nis that, well, AEDPA specifically contemplates\n\namended complaints and specifically contemplates\n\npetition for rehearing, but I take that just as\n\nan acknowledgment that their test is\n\ninconsistent with the structure of the statute,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"57","file_name":"Banister v.
