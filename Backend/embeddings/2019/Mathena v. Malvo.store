HEYTENS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nFifteen years ago, Lee Malvo was\n\ntried, convicted, and sentenced for his role in\n\nthe D.C. sniper attacks. Almost a decade later,\n\nMalvo sought federal habeas relief, relying\n\nexclusively on the new rule announced by this\n\nCourt in Miller versus Alabama.\n\nBut Miller\u0027s rule does not cover\n\nMalvo\u0027s case, and the lower courts erred in\n\nholding otherwise. I\u0027d like to make three\n\npoints, one about Miller, one about Montgomery,\n\nand one about why this matters.\n\nFirst, if Miller\u0027s holding isn\u0027t\n\nconcerned with mandatory sentences, much of this\n\nCourt\u0027s language in Miller makes very little\n\nsense. Miller repeatedly stated its own holding\n\nin terms of mandatory sentences, and the Court\u0027s\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nanalysis specifically distinguished between\n\nmandatory and non-mandatory states.\n\nSecond, Montgomery must be interpreted\n\nboth in light of Miller and in light of the\n\nfacts that were before the Court. All of the\n\ndefendants before the Court in both Miller and\n\nMontgomery had received mandatory sentences, and\n\nthis Court should not lightly interpret a\n\ndecision about retroactivity as having\n\nretroactively announced a new rule governing\n\nnon-mandatory sentences.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Mathena v.

Malvo\u0027s victims were\n\nalready required to endure one full trial and\n\nsentencing hearing more than a decade ago, and\n\nthe Court should not like -- lightly ask them to\n\ngo through another, particularly given that the\n\noriginal sentencing fully complied with then\n\ncontrolling constitutional restrictions.\n\nI waive the remainder of my two\n\nminutes.\n\nSo turning to the first point about\n\nMiller, I -- I think it\u0027s just extremely hard,\n\nas Malvo\u0027s brief now clarifies, that he only\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nsought habeas relief based on Miller. And if\n\nyou look at Malvo\u0027s original habeas petition --\n\nit\u0027s on page 80, I believe, page 80 of the\n\npetition appendix -- he doesn\u0027t just say that\n\nhe\u0027s seeking relief based on Miller; he says\n\nhe\u0027s seeking relief based on Miller\u0027s holding\n\nthat mandatory life without parole violates the\n\nEighth Amendment.\n\nSo I think even Malvo, when he\n\noriginally sought habeas in this case,\n\nrecognized the precise nature of Miller\u0027s\n\nholding, and I think it\u0027s extraordinarily hard\n\nto get away from that.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, could","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"3","file_name":"Mathena v.

First\n\nof all, the substantive retroactive holding of\n\nMiller is limited to mandatory sentences. Any\n\nobjection Malvo has to the particular sentencing\n\nproceedings in his individual case would at best\n\nfall under what Montgomery describes as Miller\u0027s\n\nprocedural component, which isn\u0027t retroactive.\n\nSecond, all that procedural component\n\nrequires is the opportunity to raise age as a\n\nreason for a lower sentence. Neither Montgomery\n\nnor Miller prescribes a precise formula for\n\ntaking age into account, let alone requires a\n\nsentencer to consider age even when a defendant\n\nhimself fails to put it at issue.\n\nNow, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked how\n\nwe know that a discretionary scheme -- the\n\nexistence of a discretionary scheme is\n\nsufficient to protect against the substantive\n\nright that Montgomery finds that Miller\n\nrecognizes.\n\nI think we know that from a couple of\n\ndifferent places.

That\n\nindividualized sentencing hearing, as Montgomery\n\nexplained, effectuates the Eighth Amendment rule\n\nthat life without parole is an excessive\n\nsentence for most juveniles, those who are not\n\npermanently incorrigible.\n\nMiller is not limited to mandatory\n\nschemes where life without parole is the only\n\npossible punishment. It invalidated those\n\nschemes because they guarantee that courts won\u0027t\n\nconsider whether youth warrants a lower\n\nsentence, which creates an unacceptable risk of\n\nexcessive punishment, but when a court has the\n\ntheoretical power to consider a lower sentence\n\nbut doesn\u0027t do so, which is what happened here,\n\nit creates precisely the same risk, as the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n35\n\nOfficial\n\nwarden admits in his reply brief.\n\nAnd I\u0027d like to correct some of the\n\nstatements about what actually happened at the\n\nsentencing hearing here because this is -- this\n\nis important.\n\nMalvo was sentenced in 2004.
