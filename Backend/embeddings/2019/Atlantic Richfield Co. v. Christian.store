You\u0027re right that (e)(6) is under\n\nthe settlement provision, but if you look at\n\n(e)(1), it\u0027s -- it -- it equates owners on the\n\nsite with PRPs. And so the Court could leave\n\nfor another day whether PRP is coterminous with\n\ncovered persons under Section 107 and simply\n\ndecide that owners on Superfund sites are PRPs.\n\nAnd, again, we think that makes\n\nperfect sense because, by definition, when you\n\nhave a cleanup plan that takes into account an\n\nentire Superfund site, as this one does, and one\n\nlandowner does something that affects the earth\n\nor affects the environment, it\u0027s going to spread\n\nacross onto other parts of the Superfund site.\n\nAnd the water barriers that we\u0027ve\n\ndiscussed in this case are a good example, where\n\nEPA has a considered plan to treat the water in\n\na certain way, and Respondents want to dig -- I\n\nthink it\u0027s an 8,000-foot trench that would\n\nchange the gradient and would physically change\n\nthe land in a way that could endanger the whole\n\nSuperfund site off of their own property.\n\nSo it is true that when you live on a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"25","file_name":"Atlantic Richfield Co. v.
