JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear\n\nargument first this morning in Case 18-280, the\n\nNew York State Rifle \u0026 Pistol Association versus\n\nthe City of New York.\n\nMr. Clement.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nText, history, and tradition all make\n\nclear that New York City\u0027s restrictive premises\n\nlicense and accompanying transport ban are\n\nunconstitutional. The city\u0027s restriction on\n\ntransporting firearms to places where they may\n\nbe lawfully possessed and its insistence in its\n\nrevised regulations that any such transport be\n\ncontinuous and uninterrupted are premised on a\n\nview of the Second Amendment as a home-bound\n\nright, with any ability to venture beyond the\n\ncurtilage with a firearm, even locked and\n\nunloaded, a matter of government grace.\n\nThat view is inconsistent with text,\n\nhistory, tradition, and this Court\u0027s cases.  The\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\ntext of the Second Amendment protects rights to\n\nkeep and bear arms.  That latter right makes\n\nclear that the Second Amendment protects rights\n\nthat are not strictly limited to the premises.\n\nAnd there is no historical analogue\n\nfor the city\u0027s prohibition on transporting\n\nfirearms to places where they may be lawfully\n\nused. To the contrary, the second Congress\n\nrequired the militia to take their own firearms\n\nfrom their homes to the training ground.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"New York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Assn., Inc. v.

I understand the requirement that\n\nyou carry the gun unloaded or that you do it in\n\na locked container. But a ban is not a time,\n\nplace, or manner restriction.  And in\n\ndetermining which category it falls into and\n\nwhat\u0027s permissible, Heller said you start with\n\ntext, history, and tradition.\n\nAnd the Court commonly does that, even\n\nunder the First Amendment with respect to\n\ncategories, the Fourth Amendment for a search,\n\nthe Seventh Amendment for the jury trial right.\n\nHeller just says you start here.

DEARING: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nContrary to how they\u0027re presenting it\n\nnow, Petitioners framed this case narrowly.\n\nThey argue that a premises license, a premises\n\nlicense specifically, must allow certain limited\n\ntransport of the licensed handgun to effectuate\n\nits possession and use in the premises, and they\n\nsought only injunctive and declaratory relief to\n\nrequire the city to allow that limited\n\ntransport.\n\nAnd that narrow framing, in turn, has\n\ntwo implications now. First, the case is moot\n\nbecause changes in state and city law have given\n\nPetitioners everything they asked for and,\n\nindeed, more than that.\n\nPetitioners suggest these changes\n\nshould be viewed skeptically, but it\u0027s a good\n\nthing and not a cause for concern when the\n\ngovernment responds to litigation by resolving\n\nmatters through the democratic process.\n\nThe Solicitor General agrees that all\n\nthe objections actually raised by Petitioners to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n35\n\nOfficial\n\nmootness are unfounded but suggests that the\n\nCourt could proceed to the merits of the\n\nconstitutional questions anyway because\n\nPetitioners might be -- in the future be able to","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"30","file_name":"New York State Rifle \u0026amp; Pistol Assn., Inc. v.

it\u0027s direct.  It doesn\u0027t otherwise specify\n\nwhat\u0027s direct.\n\nThe city took it on itself in\n\nSection 7 of the new regs to tell you what they\n\nat least at that point thought was sufficiently\n\ndirect, which is continuous and uninterrupted.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n72\n\nOfficial\n\nNow they\u0027re now making representations\n\nthat the reg doesn\u0027t mean what it seems to mean\n\nand the like.
