JUSTICE ROBERTS: We\u0027ll hear\n\nargument first this morning in Case 18-1171,\n\nComcast Corporation versus the National\n\nAssociation of African American-Owned Media.\n\nMr. Estrada.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR. ESTRADA: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Ninth Circuit held in this case\n\nthat a plaintiff may succeed on a Section 1981\n\nclaim merely by showing that race was a factor\n\nthat was considered in the defendant\u0027s\n\ndecision-making, even if the decision would have\n\nmade and was made for entirely appropriate\n\nbusiness reasons having nothing to do with race.\n\nSolely on this basis, the Ninth\n\nCircuit saved the Plaintiff\u0027s third complaint\n\nfrom dismissal.  We submit that this decision is\n\nwrong and should be reversed for at least three\n\nreasons.\n\nThe first is that it is contrary to\n\nthis Court\u0027s decisions, such as Gross and\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nNassar, holding that but-for causation is the\n\nbackground rule that Congress must have presumed\n\nto have been adopted in all federal statutes\n\nunless the statute provides otherwise, which we\n\nsubmit Section 1981 does not, either as\n\noriginally adopted in 1866 or as amended in\n\n1991.\n\nSecond, in 1991, Congress amended\n\nTitle VII to provide for a motivating factor\n\nstandard but did not amend Section 1981 to\n\nprovide the same, even though it amended Section","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Comcast Corp. v.
