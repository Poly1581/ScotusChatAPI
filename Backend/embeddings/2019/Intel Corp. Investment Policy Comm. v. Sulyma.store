In 2015,\n\nthe Respondent, Sulyma, sued, claiming that his\n\nretirement plans imprudently overinvested in\n\nhedge funds and commodities. But more than\n\nthree years before that suit was filed, Sulyma\n\nreceived plan disclosures that apprised him of\n\nthe precise investment allocations he later\n\nclaimed were imprudent.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit held that those\n\ndisclosures would not trigger the three-year bar\n\nbecause Sulyma testified that he had not read\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Intel Corp.

WESSLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nWhen Congress said that a plaintiff\n\nmust have actual knowledge, it meant what we all\n\nunderstand that phrase to mean, that the\n\nplaintiff himself must have real awareness. The\n\nordinary definition of \"actual knowledge\"\n\ncontrols here because it accords with the\n\nfundamental rule that statutory interpretation\n\nbegins and often ends with the plain meaning of\n\nthe text.\n\nCongress chose to require actual\n\nknowledge, not constructive knowledge, before\n\nthe general six-year limitations period for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty claims will be cut in\n\nhalf, and that deliberate decision must be\n\nhonored.\n\nNow a common-sense distinction I think\n\nis all that\u0027s necessary to resolve this case,\n\nbut there are important reasons, as I think I\n\nheard just -- just now, for why Congress would\n\nhave made the choice to require actual knowledge\n\nhere.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"30","file_name":"Intel Corp.

 Right.\n\nSo there is\n\nthis, I think, separate question that is not in\n\nfront of the Court right now, which is, Justice\n\nKagan, what you\u0027ve identified, how much do you\n\nneed to know that there\u0027s been a breach of\n\nERISA.\n\nNow I think the Ninth Circuit\n\narticulated the correct standard in this case.\n\nBut this Court is not being asked in this case\n\nto decide that question because, as -- again, as\n\nI said, as the Petitioners have framed this\n\nquestion, they\u0027ve asked the Court to assume that\n\nall the relevant information was contained in\n\nthe disclosures and

RESPONDENT\n\nMR. GUARNIERI: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case can begin and end with the\n\nplain language of Section 1113(2). The\n\nthree-year limitations period in Section 1113(2)\n\nbegins to run only when the plaintiff has actual\n\nknowledge of the breach or violation. To have\n\nactual knowledge, the plaintiff\u0027s knowledge must\n\nexist as a matter of fact. Knowledge that is\n\nimputed or implied to the plaintiff as a matter\n\nof law does not suffice. That is what \"actual\"\n\nmeans in this context. If that standard is not\n\nmet, then the default six-year period in\n\nSection 1113(1) governs the timeliness of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n57\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nplaintiff\u0027s claims.\n\nNow Petitioners argue that in applying\n\nSection 1113(2), a court should presume that the\n\nplaintiff has actual knowledge of the contents\n\nof the ERISA disclosures that the plaintiff\n\nreceives at the precise moment that the\n\nplaintiff receives them, even if the plaintiff\n\nindisputably never read those disclosures.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"52","file_name":"Intel Corp.

so I think the question here is whether in\n\nthis very different context, where, you know, as\n\nI said, these actual knowledge standards come\n\nvirtually exclusively from criminal enforcement\n\nproceedings where you\u0027re trying to measure the\n\nindividual defendant\u0027s culpability.\n\nAnd, of course, there should be an\n\ninquiry in that situation into the specific\n\nstate of mind of the defendant. That\u0027s what the\n\nwhole culpability inquiry is about.\n\nHere, you\u0027re talking about a statute\n\nof limitations. And in particular -- if I might\n\nfinish -- a statute of limitations that\u0027s\n\ndesigned this three-year period to protect the\n\ninterests of defendants.
