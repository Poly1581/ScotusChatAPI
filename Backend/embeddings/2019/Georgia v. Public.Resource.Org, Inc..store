JOHNSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit held that\n\nannotations to Georgia\u0027s official code are\n\ncategorically ineligible for copyright\n\nprotection. That holding conflicts with a\n\nstraightforward application of the Copyright\n\nAct\u0027s text and this Court\u0027s precedents.\n\nStarting with the statute, Sections\n\n101 and 103 of the Act expressly provide that\n\nannotations are copyrightable derivative works.\n\nNothing in the Act supports stripping Georgia\u0027s\n\nannotations of copyright protection merely\n\nbecause they were prepared by a contractor on\n\nbehalf of a state agency.\n\nTherefore, the crux of the party\u0027s\n\ndispute is whether this Court\u0027s 19th-century\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\nhttps://Public.Resource.Org\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nprecedents support a decision different from the\n\none that would be reached by applying standard\n\ninterpretive principles to the Copyright Act\u0027s\n\nplain text. They do not.\n\nIn fact, those decisions strongly\n\nfavor Georgia. Together, they hold that while\n\njudicial opinions are not copyrightable,\n\nannotations added to opinions by a court\u0027s\n\nofficial reporter are copyrightable works of\n\nauthorship.\n\nSimilarly, while statutory text is not","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Georgia v.

ARGUMENT OF ERIC F. CITRON\n\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\nMR. CITRON: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nI think it\u0027s useful to remember that\n\nthe question Georgia presented in this case was\n\nwhether the government edicts doctrine extends\n\nto documents that lack the force of law. The\n\nanswer to that question is clearly yes. The\n\nUnited States agrees with us that it has to be\n\nyes. That\u0027s required by the Court\u0027s decision in\n\nBanks. And it seems necessary unless\n\nlegislative history, agency guidance documents,\n\nunpublished judicial decisions are going to be\n\nsubject to copyright.\n\nGeorgia hasn\u0027t proposed an alternative\n\ntest, but we\u0027ve proposed a test that we\u0027ve drawn\n\nfrom the language in this Court\u0027s decisions,\n\nparticularly Wheaton as it was understood by\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n33\n\nOfficial\n\nJustice Story and Callaghan, which adopted that\n\nunderstanding, and it asks two straightforward\n\nquestions: Is this a legal work and is it\n\npublished under the authority of the state?\n\nIf it is, then it can\u0027t be","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"28","file_name":"Georgia v.

I mean, I agree, you\u0027ve\n\nclarified, everybody to me. I mean, the\n\nquestion is: What function does this particular\n\nset of words play in the law?\n\nAnd if we look at the precedent, back\n\nwhere Justice Ginsburg was, it\u0027s hard for me to\n\nsee that it plays much more of a precedent than\n\nWheaton -- I mean much more of a role than\n\nWheaton\u0027s annotations, and I can think of cases\n\nwhere a lot of people would say in respect to\n\nWestlaw, in respect to Lexis, and probably here,\n\nah, yes, that\u0027s what they say, but go read the\n\ncase, my friend, and it isn\u0027t as good a summary\n\nas you think. All right?\n\nSo what you\u0027d have to show is that the\n\nofficial Westlaw actually plays a larger role in\n\nthe law, in a law-making function, than does\n\nWestlaw. I doubt that there\u0027s something here\n\nthat shows that, but maybe there is.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"39","file_name":"Georgia v.
