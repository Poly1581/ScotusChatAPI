Sex and sexual\n\norientation are independent and distinct\n\ncharacteristics, and sexual orientation\n\ndiscrimination by itself does not constitute\n\ndiscrimination because of sex under Title VII.\n\nThat\u0027s just as true today as it was in\n\n1964.\n\nThe core error in the Second Circuit\u0027s\n\nholding is actually quite similar to the error\n\nthat led this Court to reverse in Oncale. In\n\nOncale, the Fifth Circuit had held that same-sex\n\nharassment claims were categorically excluded\n\nfrom Title VII.

First, I don\u0027t think\n\nthat one contributing cause is sex.
