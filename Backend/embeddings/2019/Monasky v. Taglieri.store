PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nJust to pick up on Justice Sotomayor\u0027s\n\nquestion, I -- I think the -- the European and\n\nU.K. courts have talked about the family and\n\nsocial environment in which the child\u0027s life has\n\ndeveloped. I think that, to me, is not that\n\ndifferent from where the child usually lives.\n\nIt may avoid the problem of duration.\n\nI think a lot of the problems in these cases","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"38","file_name":"Monasky v.

Three\n\npoints, Your Honor.\n\nWith respect to the standard applied\n\nby foreign courts to cases involving infants, I\n\nwould point the Court to paragraph 55 in the\n\nEuropean Union Court of Justice\u0027s decision in\n\nthe Mercredi case.\n\nThe Court there stated that an infant\n\nnecessarily shares the social and family\n\nenvironment of the circle of people on whom he\n\nor she is dependent. Consequently, where the\n\ninfant is, in fact, looked after by her mother,\n\nit is necessary to assess the mother\u0027s\n\nintegration in her family and social\n\nenvironment.\n\nThat is the standard that Lady Hale\n\nadopts in the A versus A case at paragraph 54,\n\nsub (6): Applying that standard in this case","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"58","file_name":"Monasky v.
