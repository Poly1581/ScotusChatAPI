I think diligence,\n\nas this Court has said in Bank of Columbia, and\n\nI can cite five more cases, that is a pure\n\nquestion of law.\n\nBut, when the Board decides a case in\n\na different way and says we\u0027re deciding this as\n\na matter of discretion, we\u0027re issuing what the\n\nBoard calls a discretionary denial, that is the\n\nsort of issue that is not subject to judicial\n\nreview.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n22\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nAnd when the Board does a\n\ndiscretionary denial, that is very clear on the\n\nface of it.
