ROTH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nOnce again, the government is trying\n\nto use the open-ended federal fraud statutes to\n\nenforce honest government at the state and local\n\nlevels. Its theory this time is that the\n\ndefendants committed property fraud by\n\nreallocating two traffic lanes from one public\n\nroad to another without disclosing their real\n\npolitical reason for doing so.\n\nThis theory turns the integrity of\n\nevery official action at every level of\n\ngovernment into a potential federal fraud\n\ninvestigation. It end-runs McNally and Skilling\n\nby subsuming honest services fraud within\n\nproperty fraud and by criminalizing ulterior\n\nmotives even without bribes or kickbacks.

This Court in\n\nCleveland held that regulatory authority is not\n\nproperty. So an official who induces a\n\nsovereign decision through deceit has not\n\nobtained property by fraud. Only when the\n\nofficial lies to divert state resources to\n\nprivate use has he stepped outside the\n\nregulatory realm and committed property fraud.\n\nThis rule distinguishes property fraud from\n\nhonest services fraud and from routine political\n\nconduct.\n\nHere, because the defendants simply\n\nreallocated the traffic lanes from one public","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Kelly v.

Cleveland focused on\n\nproperty and what did Congress mean when it said\n\n\"property.\" I think it said, we are concerned\n\nwith cheating people out of their property\n\nrights.\n\nAnd you can do that with a government\n\nentity. You can certainly cheat the government\n\nout of its property, Pasquantino is the example\n\nof that where the Court said, you owe tax -- you\n\nowe taxes to the government, you lied to avoid\n\npaying your taxes, you\u0027ve committed property\n\nfraud. The same, by the way, could occur in a\n\nPort Authority situation.\n\nYou owe a toll and you lie to evade\n\npaying the toll, you have cheated the government\n\nout of property that it\u0027s owed. But if what\n\nyou\u0027re doing is making a regulatory decision\n\nlike allocating public resources among public\n\nuses, and there\u0027s no question that the main line\n\nis a public use, just as much as the special\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n13","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"10","file_name":"Kelly v.

This case is\n\nabout a very specific kind of fraud,\n\ncommandeering fraud.\n\nIt is when the defendant tries to take\n\nover property that is in the hands of the victim\n\nand manage it as if it is his own property.\n\nThat\u0027s what they were doing with the lanes on\n\nthe bridge and the employee resources.\n\nSo, for example, if there\u0027s a snowplow\n\nsitting there and I take the keys to the\n\nsnowplow and I drive off in the snowplow,\n\neveryone would agree that I\u0027ve obtained the\n\nsnowplow.\n\nIf I instead put on one of those masks\n\nfrom the mission impossible TV show or the movie","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"32","file_name":"Kelly v.
