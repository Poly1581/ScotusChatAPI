LESSIG: Well, it\u0027s interesting,\n\nBurroughs itself, Burroughs versus the United\n\nStates, of course, found it inherent in the\n\nfederal power to be able to protect federal\n\nelections from corruption.\n\nIn Fitzgerald versus Green, they saw\n\nit as incidental to the power to appoint\n\nelectors to be able to assure that the election,\n\nin that case the vote by the people, was\n\nconsistent with law.\n\nEither of those could create the\n\nauthority to avoid corruption, but, of course,\n\ncorruption, like bribery, is independent of the\n\nvote. You don\u0027t need to police a vote to be\n\nable to police corruption, just as with the\n\nSpeech and Debate Clause, you can convict a\n\nCongressperson of bribery even though the\n\nbribery includes the vote that might have\n\noccurred.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nGinsburg?\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Lessig, I was\n\nsurprised with the answer you gave to the Chief\n\nabout Ray.

And, of course, the\n\nlikelihood of that is extremely small.\n\nBut what we\u0027ve also said is there\u0027s\n\nrisk on both sides.  The Twentieth Amendment\n\nself-consciously presupposed electoral\n\ndiscretion in the context of the death of a\n\ncandidate prior to the vote in the Electoral\n\nCollege.\n\nAnd if that happens, but laws like\n\nWashington and Colorado ban the exercise of\n\ndiscretion, then the votes from those electors\n\ncould, in principle, be wasted.

That power has\n\nalways included the power to set conditions of\n\nappointment, such as requiring that an elector\n\nlive in the state or show up for the Electoral\n\nCollege meeting.\n\nOne condition that states are clearly\n\nallowed to impose is that electors promise to\n\nsupport the presidential candidate preferred by\n\nthe state\u0027s voters.  States have been choosing\n\nelectors on that basis since the founding.  This\n\nCourt approved that condition in Ray.  And the\n\nother side admits that states can impose this\n\ncondition.\n\nThe only dispute here is whether\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nstates can enforce this condition or any other\n\nvalid condition of appointment.

But two\n\nstubborn facts refute their claim.\n\nFirst, the framers and their\n\ncontemporaries clearly understood that states\n\ncould remove or fine electors after appointment.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nFrom even before the Twelfth Amendment, many\n\nstates had laws removing or fining electors for\n\nviolating the conditions of their appointment,\n\nrepudiating a central premise of Petitioners\u0027\n\nclaim.\n\nAnd, second, as this Court recognized\n\nin Ray and in McPherson, from the very first\n\npresidential election, states have been choosing\n\nelectors specifically because they had promised\n\nto support a particular presidential candidate.\n\nAnd this contradicts Petitioners\u0027 claim that the\n\nframers viewed the exercise of discretion as\n\ncentral to the elector role, and it shows that\n\nPetitioners\u0027 quarrel is not just with our\n\nlong-standing practice; it is with the framers\n\nthemselves.  Accepting their position would mean\n\nconcluding that the framers misunderstood the\n\nrole they had created.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"35","file_name":"Chiafalo v.

PURCELL: Your Honor, I think\n\nthere\u0027s three crucial problems with the other\n\nside\u0027s federal function argument.\n\nThe first is that it\u0027s just not even\n\nsupported by the cases they cite.  Burroughs and\n\nRay mention federal function in the sense that\n\nthere is a federal interest, obviously, in the\n\nconduct of presidential elections, but they\n\ndon\u0027t say or imply in any way that the Supremacy\n\nClause restricts state authority over electors.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"41","file_name":"Chiafalo v.

PURCELL: Justice Ginsburg, I\n\nthink that highlights Congress\u0027s view that it\n\nshould defer to states about the votes that they\n\ncertify to Congress to count.\n\nOf course, in every example that the\n\nother side\u0027s given, the State had certified\n\nthose votes as the State\u0027s votes.  But, if you\n\nlook at 2016, Congress also counted the votes\n\nfrom Colorado and from Minnesota, where the\n\nstate replaced faithless electors with electors\n\nwho promised to vote as pledged and did vote as\n\npledged, and Congress counted those votes as\n\nwell.\n\nSo what you see in the history is\n\nCongress deferring to the State\u0027s designation of\n\nwhich electors are validly appointed by the\n\nState.\n\nJUSTICE GINSBURG:  Thank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nBreyer?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"43","file_name":"Chiafalo v.

So if -- if -- even if Congress could\n\nreject a ballot, for example, if it found out --\n\nif it knew that the elector had been bribed, the\n\nState has lost that electoral vote and cannot\n\nget it back.\n\nThe State cannot -- the Congress\n\ncannot appoint a new elector for the State.  And\n\njust rejecting that ballot might alter the\n\noutcome of the presidential election, rejecting\n\nseveral ballots might.  So the idea that\n\nCongress can solve this after the fact is\n\njust -- it\u0027s not true and it -- and it -- it --\n\nit -- it ignores the constitutional delegation\n\nof power to the states.\n\nTurning to your other points, I mean,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"45","file_name":"Chiafalo v.
