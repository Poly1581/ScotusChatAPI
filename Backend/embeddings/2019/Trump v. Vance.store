So --\n\nand we were just discussing in the previous case\n\nthe nature of that burden.\n\nFor counsel, the President hiring\n\ncounsel for each time he could be subpoenaed as\n\na witness or, in this particular case, as a\n\ntarget, would raise a serious impact on the\n\nPresident\u0027s Article II functions.  So we think a\n\ncategorical approach -- and it\u0027s very specific\n\nhere -- state process as to the President --\n\ntargeting the President\u0027s documents in a\n\ncriminal proceeding should be prohibited.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nGorsuch?\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, I -- I\u0027d\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"18","file_name":"Trump v.

The\n\n2300 prosecutors across the country necessarily\n\nplace more emphasis on local interests than\n\nnational ones.  A special needs standard ensures\n\nthat federal courts balance the prosecutor\u0027s\n\nlocal need for information against national\n\ninterests, including the President\u0027s need to do\n\nhis job.\n\nSecond, ordinary grand jury rules are\n\nnot designed to protect Article II interests.\n\nThat\u0027s why, in Nixon, the Court held a federal\n\nprosecutor had to show a demonstrated specific\n\nneed for the information sought. A local\n\nprosecutor should at least be required to meet\n\nthe same standard.\n\nAs the Court has repeatedly said, in\n\nno case of this kind would a court be required\n\nto proceed against the President as against an\n\nordinary citizen.  And, here, the district\n\nattorney hasn\u0027t tried to meet the special needs\n\nstandard.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General\n\nFrancisco, we -- we just heard Mr. Sekulow argue\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"25","file_name":"Trump v.

So what was wrong with Mr. Trump\u0027s\n\nposition?\n\nGENERAL FRANCISCO:  Your Honor, I\n\nactually think that Mr. Sekulow makes a very\n\nstrong argument on the immunity issue.  We just\n\ndon\u0027t think it\u0027s one that the Court needs to\n\naddress, at least until the prosecutor argues\n\nand attempts to meet the special needs standard.\n\nHere, since the prosecutor hasn\u0027t\n\nargued and isn\u0027t arguing before this Court that\n\nhe meets the special needs standard, there\u0027s no\n\nreason for the Court to address the broader\n\nimmunity question, and -- and -- and it\u0027s the\n\nCourt\u0027s ordinary processes to try to avoid those\n\nbroader and more difficult questions when\n\npossible, and, here, we think that the special\n\nneeds standard would fully resolve this case at\n\nthis stage of the proceedings.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"26","file_name":"Trump v.

court\n\nwill examine whether or not the criteria you --\n\nyou talk about, which I gather is the test under\n\nNixon, are met, and, under Mr. Sekulow\u0027s\n\nstandard, the -- would not immediately

And that\u0027s why the Court\n\nreserved judgment on that question.\n\nSo I think, when you put those two\n\nthings together, it does make it entirely\n\nappropriate to hold a local prosecutor in state\n\ncourt to the same standard as the federal\n\nprosecutor was held to in the Nixon case.\n\nAnd, indeed, even if you were to take\n\nthe district attorney\u0027s own case-specific test,\n\nI think you would need the special needs\n\nstandard.  After all, we don\u0027t typically get\n\ndiscovery into a grand jury proceeding.\n\nSo the only way to assess at the front\n\nend whether the prosecutor is issuing an unduly\n\nburdensome subpoena or issuing a subpoena in bad\n\nfaith is to require some kind of showing of\n\nspecial need.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n41\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"34","file_name":"Trump v.

But I\n\nthink all it means is that there is a -- a\n\nbalance to be struck between, in this case, the\n\nstate prosecutors, the Supremacy Clause\n\nconcerns, against the rights of states under\n\ntheir police powers and the concepts of\n\nfederalism and the -- the requirements of the\n\nTenth Amendment to allow the states to exercise\n\ntheir -- their rights, especially in the\n\ncriminal context, which, you know, are -- are so\n\nimportant.\n\nSo I think that that\u0027s the parallel to\n\nthe -- the balancing in the -- in the federal\n\nprosecutor context, but I think it\u0027s even more\n\nimportant given the federalism concerns and the\n\nfact that, you know, state prosecutors, of\n\ncourse, not only do they have the reserve police\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n102\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\npower of the states, but in -- in context of\n\ncriminal investigations, there, a large body of\n\ncriminal conduct is only prosecutable by the\n\nstates. So that\u0027s the thing that has to be\n\nbalanced here.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice\n\nGorsuch?\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Nothing further.\n\nThank you, Chief.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nKavanaugh?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"91","file_name":"Trump v.
