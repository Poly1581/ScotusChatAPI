ARGUMENT OF PAUL HUGHES\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nHUGHES: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nWhen Congress enacted the\n\njurisdiction-stripping provision in (2)(C), it\n\nexpressly defined the key term \"order of\n\nremoval.\"  It is an order that finds an\n\nindividual deportable or orders deportation.\n\nA CAT order does neither, and the\n\ngovernment does not disagree.  CAT relief is\n\ntemporary, applicable only to the country where\n\nan individual is likely to be tortured or\n\nkilled.  If CAT relief is granted, the removal\n\norder remains enforceable.

We are also pointing the Court towards\n\nthe explicit text of the Foreign Affairs Reform\n\nand Restructuring Act, which makes clear that\n\nCongress anticipated that CAT claims would be\n\nreviewable as part of a final order of review,\n\nwhich is consistent with our reading of the\n\nstatutory definition but not Petitioner\u0027s unduly\n\nnarrow understanding of that term.\n\nNow, before my time expires, Justice\n\nAlito, I would like to address the question that\n\nyou posed to Petitioner\u0027s counsel earlier.
