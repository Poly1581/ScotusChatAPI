STRAWBRIDGE:  Before these cases\n\n-- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\n\nCourt:\n\nThe subpoenas at issue here are\n\nunprecedented in every sense.  Before these\n\ncases, no court had ever upheld the use of\n\nCongress\u0027s subpoena power to demand the personal\n\nrecords of a sitting President, and no committee\n\nof Congress had even tried to compel production\n\nof such a broad swath of the President\u0027s\n\npersonal papers, let alone for the stated\n\npurpose of considering potential legislation.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"2","file_name":"Trump v.

But\n\ntheir arguments would render those limits\n\nmeaningless.  For example, they contend that\n\nthis Court should ignore the committees\u0027 avowed\n\nimproper purpose so long as they simply tack on\n\na broad reference to potential legislation.\n\nThey claim that Congress can use\n\nsubpoenas to uncover individual wrongdoing\n\nsimply because that will always inform the\n\nsufficiency of existing laws.  And they\n\nchallenge this Court\u0027s ability to even question\n\nthe constitutionality of the potential\n\nlegislation that they rely upon.\n\nThe committees\u0027 obvious overreach is\n\nsufficient to invalidate these subpoenas even in\n\na typical case.

STRAWBRIDGE:  Well, Eastland --\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly,\n\ncounsel.\n\nMR. STRAWBRIDGE:  Yeah.  Eastland --\n\nEastland was not -- didn\u0027t even raise that\n\nissue. Eastland was, in fact, personal papers.\n\nBut, with respect, I guess the main\n\npoint I would make is whatever presumption this\n\nCourt has previously applied in cases that\n\ninvolve separation of powers, it should not put\n\na -- any -- any finger on the scale for\n\nCongress\u0027s asserted legislative power in this\n\ncase.\n\nAnd, indeed, in numerous separation of\n\npowers cases, starting with Kilbourn, the Court\n\nhas declined to extend any presumption that --\n\nthat -- that Congress had a legitimate power.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"17","file_name":"Trump v.

I think what strikes me about\n\nthis case is, you know, this isn\u0027t the first\n\nconflict between Congress and the President, as\n\nmany of my colleagues have pointed out.\n\nWe\u0027ve never had to address this issue,\n\nand the reason is because Congress and the\n\nPresident have reached accommodations with each\n\nother, and sometimes one has gotten more and\n\nsometimes the other has gotten more, but there\n\nhas always been this accommodation-seeking.\n\nAnd what it seems to me you\u0027re asking\n\nus to do is to put a kind of 10-ton weight on\n\nthe scales between the President and Congress\n\nand essentially to make it impossible for\n\nCongress to perform oversight and to carry out\n\nits functions where the President is concerned.\n\nAnd you\u0027re quite right in what you\n\nsaid before, that this isn\u0027t going to be the\n\nlast such case, and I wonder whether that fact\n\nisn\u0027t a good reason to reject your proposed\n\nrule.\n\nMR.

And this gets me back to what\n\nJustice Breyer had said, is that, you know,\n\nthese subpoenas are for personal records, where\n\nthe President is just a man.\n\nThey\u0027re not for official records,\n\nwhere the President might have executive\n\nprivilege, where we have to worry about the\n\nconduct of governance and about the way the\n\nexecutive branch operates.\n\nAnd as with Justice Breyer, I guess I\n\nwould like to hear your views on why that\n\nwouldn\u0027t suggest that there is a lower standard\n\nhere, not a higher one.\n\nMR.

And it targets only the\n\nPresident.\n\nI have no idea why one would serve a\n\nsubpoena that broad, both in breadth and\n\nduration, if what one is concerned about is a\n\nfar more specific topic that would apply, I\n\nwould think, to federal candidates more\n\ngenerally and more narrowly to foreign\n\ntransactions and to more recent transactions.\n\nAnd there is nothing in the red brief that\n\nexplains the mismatch.\n\nOn the other side, the Financial\n\nServices Committee says it\u0027s investigating money\n\nlaundering after the 2008 financial crisis.  But\n\nits subpoena only goes back to the middle of\n\n2016, and, again, it targets the President.\n\nNone of this makes any sense if what\n\nyou are doing is in aid of legislation.\n\nJUSTICE ALITO:  Justice Ginsburg","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"33","file_name":"Trump v.
