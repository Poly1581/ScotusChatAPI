An order like that\n\nis a penalty, as this Court\u0027s unanimous decision\n\nin Kokesh makes clear.\n\nA penalty must be authorized by\n\nstatute.  So must any action by an\n\nadministrative agency.  There is no statutory\n\nauthority for the SEC to seek disgorgement\n\norders from a federal court and, therefore, it\n\ncannot.\n\nI have three main points to make this\n\nmorning.

RAPAWY: It did, Your Honor.\n\nHowever, I do not think that that supports the\n\ngovernment\u0027s position here for two reasons.\n\nThe first is that those cases, the\n\ncases that form that backdrop were not\n\ninterpreting the text, not interpreting the\n\nwords, and so the prior construction canon by\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n16\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nits terms does not apply.\n\nThe second and perhaps more\n\nsubstantive reason is that the decisions in the\n\ncourt -- in the circuit courts were not,\n\nalthough there was -- there was a consensus that\n\nthe SEC could get something accounted as\n\ndisgorgement, there was not a consensus as to\n\nwhat the -- what that disgorgement was. And I\n\nwould point to two specific examples.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"13","file_name":"Liu v.

That\u0027s a Seventh Circuit\n\ndecision by Judge Posner.  It\u0027s earlier the same\n\nyear that Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted. And that\n\ndecision says that the relief in that case, the\n\ndisgorgement in that case, counted as equitable\n\nrelief under Section 21(d) only because it was\n\nrelief against a fiduciary.\n\nSo, if you think that Congress meant\n\nto adopt the circuits, you would then have to\n\ndecide did it mean to adopt Judge Posner\u0027s view,\n\nin which case we would be correct that only\n\nfiduciaries are covered.\n\nThe second example that I would give\n\nyou is the Fifth Circuit\u0027s decision in SEC\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n17\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nversus Blatt, and that was a decision in which\n\nit explicitly stated the money was going back to\n\nthe investors.\n\nAnd so, to the extent that what the\n\ngovernment has sought to assert here is the\n\nauthority to send the money to the Treasury,\n\nwell, would Congress have looked to the decision\n\nin Blatt and said: Well, no, actually, the\n\nmoney, it looks like it would go back to the\n\ninvestors and not to the Treasury.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"14","file_name":"Liu v.

There\u0027s no reason to read the\n\ndecision more broadly.\n\nAnd, in particular, the three reasons\n\nthat the Court gave for concluding that it was a\n\npenalty for these purposes don\u0027t -- they can\u0027t\n\nmap onto the criteria for determining whether\n\nsomething is equitable relief.

And\n\nin that case, the Court emphasized that when the\n\ninterstate compact was ratified by Congress, it\n\ntook on the character of a public law.
