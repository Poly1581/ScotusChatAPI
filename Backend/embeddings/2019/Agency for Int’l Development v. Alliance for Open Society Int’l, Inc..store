MICHEL\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. MICHEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nTwenty years ago, the HIV/AIDS\n\npandemic was devastating the world.  In\n\nresponse, President Bush proposed and Congress\n\nadopted the Leadership Act.  Since reauthorized\n\nthree times, the Act has committed nearly 80\n\nbillion dollars to global AIDS relief, and it\n\nhas worked, saving more than 17 million lives in\n\nthe most successful American foreign aid effort\n\nsince the Marshall Plan.\n\nThe funding condition at issue here\n\nrequires recipients to have a policy opposing\n\nprostitution and sex trafficking, which Congress\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\nfound are coercive practices that spread\n\nHIV/AIDS and degrade women and girls. This\n\nCourt held that applying that condition to\n\nRespondents\u0027 domestic entities violates the\n\nunconstitutional conditions doctrine.  But\n\nRespondents sought more, and the question now is\n\nwhether the condition can still be applied to\n\nforeign grant recipients operating abroad.\n\nIt can for two straightforward\n\nreasons.  Foreign entities lack constitutional\n\nrights, so they cannot bring an unconstitutional\n\nconditions claim, and neither can Respondents\n\nbecause they are not subject to the funding\n\ncondition.  Thanks to their victory in this\n\nCourt, Respondents can accept and use funds\n\nwithout any compelled speech.

Many of the\n\nRespondents, the U.S. entities do, in fact,\n\noperate in foreign countries through branch\n\noffices, and, as a result of this Court\u0027s prior\n\ndecision, they always have a choice to operate\n\nin that way without compromising their speech in\n\nany way. They are, in other words, completely\n\nin charge of their own message while also\n\naccepting Leadership Act funds.\n\nAnd -- and to take your second point,\n\nif they make the choice to operate through a\n\nforeign entity because they decide that that is\n\nmore convenient or more effective, they have to\n\naccept the bitter with the sweet, to be sure,\n\noperating through a distinct legal entity, but\n\nthey\u0027re not without recourse.  They can, for\n\nexample, explain that the policy statement being\n\nissued by the foreign entity doesn\u0027t reflect\n\ntheir own views.\n\nTheir free speech allows them to do\n\nthat.

In Hurley, we said that\n\nparade organizers could be identified by the\n\npeople who marched in their parade.  And,\n\nsimilarly, in Regan, we said that an entity\n\ncould speak through an affiliate who would be\n\nrecognized as itself because it could then do\n\nlobbying that Regan couldn\u0027t do under the\n\ngovernment program.\n\nSo these cases seem to suggest to me\n\nthat at least in the First Amendment context,\n\nlet\u0027s put aside any other context, but in the\n\nFirst Amendment context, we are less concerned","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"19","file_name":"Agency for Int’l Development v.

BOWKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe undisputed record shows that the\n\nU.S. Respondents themselves suffer First\n\nAmendment harms when the policy requirement is\n\nimposed on their foreign affiliate.\n\nRespondents and their affiliates share\n\na name, brand, logo, mission, and voice.  They\n\nspeak as one, make speech and policy decisions\n\ntogether, and are indistinguishable to the\n\npublic.\n\nAs a result, the First Amendment\n\nrights of U.S. Respondents are violated here in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"27","file_name":"Agency for Int’l Development v.

Under regulations that prohibit\n\nany CARE entity from contradicting the pledge,\n\neven on its own time and dime, thus making it\n\nimpossible for CARE U.S. to disavow CARE Kenya\u0027s\n\npledge without engaging in doublespeak and\n\nlosing U.S. funding for its global network.\n\nThe government says the burden is on\n\nRespondents to avoid such harm by applying for\n\nfunding themselves, severing their connections\n\nto affiliates, or disavowing the pledge.  But\n\nthis has it backward.\n\nWhen a statute violates the First\n\nAmendment, the burden is on the government, not\n\nthe speaker, to give First Amendment freedoms\n\nthe necessary breathing space.

what concerns me today is not\n\nso much the immediate impact of a decision in\n\nyour favor but where it would lead.\n\nSo let me ask, because I am concerned\n\nthat it will force Congress either to

So let\n\nme give you this example.\n\nExcuse me. Suppose that the -- the\n\nUnited States provides grants to domestic\n\nentities and allows them -- excuse me -- to make\n\nsub-grants to foreign schools for the purpose of\n\npromoting education in countries with weak\n\neducational systems.  And suppose that Congress\n\nspecifies that any foreign entity that gets a\n\nsub-grant must have a policy denouncing\n\nterrorist attacks against American civilians.\n\nWould that be unconstitutional?\n\nMR.

Just a few points in rebuttal.\n\nFirst, to respond to Justice\n\nSotomayor\u0027s question about facial invalidity,\n\nFootnote 1 of our reply brief explains that the\n\ngovernment\u0027s prior submission was clear that the\n\nstatute was -- it was being challenged only with\n\nrespect to domestic entities, and, in fact, a\n\ntrue facial invalidation would invalidate the\n\nstatute even as applied to foreign entities that\n\nhave no connection to the United States, which I\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n62\n\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\n\ntake it my friend has just conceded is not his\n\nposition.\n\nSecond, my friend concedes -- my\n\nfriend stated that the U.S. entity truly is in\n\ncontrol.  And I think that\u0027s exactly right.  But\n\nthat ultimately underscores that it\u0027s the U.S.\n\nentity, the holder of the First Amendment\n\nrights, that is making a choice to affiliate\n\nwith a foreign entity that accepts Leadership\n\nAct funds.\n\nUnlike in this case last time and\n\nunlike in cases like Hurley and Masterpiece, the\n\nU.S. entity is not required to make that choice.\n\nThe U.S. entity has a separate choice to accept\n\nLeadership Act funds itself and operate itself","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2019","index":"54","file_name":"Agency for Int’l Development v.
