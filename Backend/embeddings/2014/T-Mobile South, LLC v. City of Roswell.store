Congress imagined, and that it can be done, as the \n\n17 statute itself requires, on an expedited basis. \n\n18  That\u0027s all we\u0027re asking for today, and we \n\n19

Mr. Fisher, suppose that I \n\n23 think that you\u0027re right about that, but then the \n\n24 question is did Congress require that.  And I take it \n\n25 that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required\n\n56\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 reasons, it required that by saying that there was \n\n2 substantial evidence review, but that it didn\u0027t require \n\n3 the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed, \n\n4 there\u0027s a savings clause which says that all doubts go \n\n5

notwithstanding that district courts are going to \n\n9 struggle with it, we should go with the SG\u0027s rule rather \n\n10 than with yours. \n\n11  MR. FISHER:  We think the best reading of \n\n12 sub (iii) is that Congress actually did require this. \n\n13  As the city itself pointed out, it separates \n\n14 the notion of a decision in writing from whether it has \n\n15
