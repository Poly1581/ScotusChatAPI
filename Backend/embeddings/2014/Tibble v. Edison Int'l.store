 MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief \n\n9 Justice, and may it please the Court: \n\n10  This Court granted certiorari to decide \n\n11 whether ERISA\u0027s statute of limitations bars claims for \n\n12 breaches of fiduciary duty regarding investment options \n\n13 that were added to a plan more than six years before the \n\n14 suit was filed.  The answer is no.  The statute does not \n\n15 bar such claims for three reasons. \n\n16  First, ERISA\u0027s fiduciary duties include \n\n17 monitoring existing investment options and removing \n\n18 imprudent ones.  Second, each failure to review and \n\n19 remove an imprudent investment option starts a new \n\n20 statute of limitations. \n\n21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  One of the things that I \n\n22 was looking for, Mr. Frederick, in the record is some \n\n23 evidence as to what exactly that monitoring entails. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"1","file_name":"Tibble v.

purchase standard, but it\u0027s still ­­ they ­­ they say \n\n23 that within that period, you can bring a suit. \n\n24  MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  If it is the \n\n25 equivalent ­­ the changed circumstances are the\n\n22\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 equivalent of bringing a new fund.  The reason that I \n\n2 was trying to clarify that is because I think a \n\n3 person ­­ an ordinary person could just be talking and \n\n4 say, well, should I make changes to the fund or not?  It \n\n5 depends on if circumstances change.  But that\u0027s not ­­\n\n6 the Ninth Circuit wasn\u0027t addressing that merits question \n\n7 of whether they had breached the duty of prudence or \n\n8 they hadn\u0027t breached the duty of prudence.  They were \n\n9 limiting the claim on statute of limitations grounds \n\n10 because it either had to be a fund ­­ a new fund being \n\n11

claim for imprudent monitoring and retention of funds \n\n21 based on what happened within the limitations period. \n\n22

there was a trial on whether or not they could and\n\n11 should ­­ the fiduciaries could and should have switched \n\n12 the share classes. \n\n13  The court went on and on, took over the \n\n14 questioning to ask whether or not that should have \n\n15 happened here; and there was evidence in the record as \n\n16 to why it didn\u0027t happen here.  And I can go into that \n\n17 evidence.

say that that issue wasn\u0027t fairly raised.  All right. \n\n20  So I look at the cert petitions; and in \n\n21 their cert petition on page 18, 19, 20, et cetera, it \n\n22

 But we think the question really is, as a \n\n5 court of review reviewing the judgment, the question is,\n\n6 is the judgment incorrect.  And there\u0027s no basis for \n\n7

 What a plaintiff in that situation has to \n\n20 show, is a violation, a breach, of the continuing duty \n\n21 to monitor, so then the case becomes about what the \n\n22 scope of that duty is.
