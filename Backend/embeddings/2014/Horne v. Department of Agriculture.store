with a shovel and some burlap sacks; it takes the \n\n3 raisins.  I would say, well, sounds like a taking to me. \n\n4  At the next point ­­\n\n5  MR. McCONNELL:  Me, too. \n\n6  JUSTICE BREYER:  ­­ the Constitution doesn\u0027t \n\n7 forbid takings.  It says what you have to do is pay just \n\n8 compensation.  Now, it\u0027s at that point I want to know \n\n9 what happens, because I guess the government could \n\n10 argue, look at this program, it\u0027s a big program.  This \n\n11 program, what it does is it gives raisin farmers, at the \n\n12 public\u0027s expense, more money.  So if, in fact, you don\u0027t \n\n13 want us to take your raisins, all right, fine.  But \n\n14 there\u0027d be no program if everybody said that.  So we \n\n15 have a rule against free riders. \n\n16  Now we\u0027ll give you what it cost you to take \n\n17 your raisins.  What it cost you is, in fact, the \n\n18 difference between what you receive given the program \n\n19 and what you would receive without the program.  That \n\n20 difference works in your favor.  It gives you money.  It \n\n21 doesn\u0027t take money.  So there is no compensation due. \n\n22 In fact, if we were to have compensation, you should pay \n\n23 us, the government. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"11","file_name":"Horne v.

you back to the very first thing that you said in this \n\n18 argument?\n\nBecause you said typically, the handler\n\n19 doesn\u0027t take the product and the handler doesn\u0027t pay for \n\n20 the product, and you would think that the Hornes here \n\n21 would only have a takings claim, assuming that they do \n\n22 have a takings claim, for the raisins that they produced \n\n23 and not for the raisins that other people produced.  But \n\n24 you said that that\u0027s not correct in this case? \n\n25  MR. McCONNELL:  It is not, because they\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n \n\n \n\nOfficial\n\n62\n\n1 pay ­­ the ­­ a check went out from the Raisin Marketing \n\n2

actually the ­­ the only people with a financial \n\n6 interest in the raisins in this case.  That is unusual. \n\n7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. McConnell, this \n\n8 is probably neither here nor there, but what has the \n\n9 impact of the drought been on the raisin producers?  Do \n\n10 you know? \n\n11  MR. McCONNELL:  It is not good. \n\n12  (Laughter.) \n\n13
