 MR. LARAMORE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it \n\n9 please the Court: \n\n10  The initial goal of this appeal was to \n\n11 reverse a single Board of Immigration Appeals decision \n\n12 that changed the removability analysis for drug \n\n13 paraphernalia convictions.  It abandoned the \n\n14 longstanding practice that Congress had ratified. \n\n15  We wanted to reinstate the rule that still \n\n16 applies in all other drug deportation decisions which \n\n17 looks at the facts that must be established by a \n\n18 conviction and at the record of conviction, when that\u0027s \n\n19 appropriate, under this Court\u0027s precedents  in Moncrieffe \n\n20 and Descamps.  That methodology has led to tens of \n\n21 thousands of drug deportations each year, but not for \n\n22 someone convicted of possessing a sock. \n\n23  Now, the government has argued that this \n\n24 wrongheaded BIA paraphernalia decision should be \n\n25 expanded to all drug convictions.  The government wants\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\n1 any drug conviction to be a deportable offense, even if \n\n2 it\u0027s clearly for a non­Federal drug. \n\n3  This Court should reject the government\u0027s \n\n4

one of the strange things about this case is you have a\n\n6 disjunction.  A sock doesn\u0027t count as drug paraphernalia \n\n7 under the Federal law, but it does under the State law; \n\n8 it means any container.  And then to take that State \n\n9 law ­­ I mean, suppose we ­­ we have a conviction for \n\n10 one of those drugs that\u0027s not on the Federal list, just \n\n11 for possession of that drug, and then we have another \n\n12 conviction where that drug is inside a sock and it\u0027s for \n\n13 drug paraphernalia. \n\n14  So in the one case you would say not \n\n15 removable, if it\u0027s just the substance itself, and in the \n\n16 other case, because of the sock, it becomes removable? \n\n17  MS. KOVNER:

I think the classic paraphernalia items \n\n21 and the ones you see most often prosecuted in Kansas and \n\n22 in other States are things like hyperdermic needles and \n\n23 scales and substances that are used to mix with drugs \n\n24 before sale, and I think it\u0027s easiest to see in that \n\n25

Your Honor, we don\u0027t think that \n\n13 Congress viewed drug crimes that way.  The way it wrote \n\n14 this removal provision was to say that any crime \n\n15 relating to controlled substances permits the BIA to \n\n16 seek removal.  And that\u0027s because, we think, Congress \n\n17 saw drug crimes as quite serious.  This Court has \n\n18
