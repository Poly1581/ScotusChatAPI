Judge Posner, do, in fact, discuss this problem of \n\n8 administering a complex rule of reason rule ­­ rule of \n\n9 reason in a complicated area, 50 years after the simple \n\n10 rule has been in effect. \n\n11  MR. MELNIK:  So two responses to your point, \n\n12 Justice Breyer.  One is I think it\u0027s again important to \n\n13 remember that the rule ­­ the question is not whether \n\n14 the rule of reason should apply to patent misuse.  The \n\n15 rule of reason already applies to patent misuse under \n\n16 decades of Federal Circuit precedent.  That\u0027s the state \n\n17 of the world right now.  The question is only whether \n\n18 these particular types of royalty arrangements should be \n\n19 aligned with the existing rule of reason regime for \n\n20 patent misuse that already exists in the world. \n\n21  The second point is that I think we need to \n\n22 remember that these are negotiated transactions, that \n\n23 this kind of royalty arrangement will only exist if the \n\n24 licensor and the licensee both agree that it makes sense \n\n25 for them.  And any answer can be priced into the \n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n22\n\nOfficial\n\n1 license.  After all, who is going to bear the risk of\n\n2 the rule of reason analysis?  It\u0027s primarily going to be \n\n3 the licensor, because the licensee will at some point, \n\n4 presumably after expiration, will say, I don\u0027t want to \n\n5 pay royalties anymore.

But I think that ­­ that crystallizes the problem, the \n\n4 conflict between Petitioner\u0027s position and the patent\n\n5 policy here, because what you\u0027re saying really saying \n\n6 is, my invention is such that 20 years isn\u0027t long enough \n\n7 for me, it\u0027s not going to realize a success until after \n\n8 the 20­year period. \n\n9  The fact that you may not be able to capture \n\n10 that is a direct consequence of the decision Congress \n\n11 made when it set the patent term.  And, in fact, for the \n\n12 concerns that are raised by particular industries, \n\n13 those ­­ those are concerns that Congress has not been \n\n14 deaf to it ­­ to them.  It passed the Hatch­Waxman Act \n\n15 in 1984 specifically targeted to the pharmaceutical \n\n16 context.  People had concerns about patent life being \n\n17 consumed during patent examination.  Congress came back \n\n18 in 1999, and set up a series of patent term adjustments \n\n19 to compensate for that. \n\n20  And if there are any industry­specific \n\n21 concerns, given the complexity of the economics here, \n\n22 given the disputes that we\u0027re having about the reliance \n\n23 interest, this is quintessentially a task for Congress \n\n24 to weigh at this point, particularly since we\u0027re talking \n\n25 about a rule that has stood for 50 years, and during \n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n38\n\nOfficial\n\n1

circuit\u0027s case law.  The question then needs to be asked \n\n3 is:  What patent policy exists that would justify some \n\n4 rule beyond the rule of reason?  And I would submit that \n\n5 neither the government nor Respondents have demonstrated \n\n6 any patent policy that is not at its core an economic \n\n7 policy.  If you look ­­ take a close look at \n\n8 Respondent\u0027s patent policy argument, it ultimately \n\n9 reduces to a question of prices and outputs in the \n\n10 post­expiration period versus pre­expiration period, and \n\n11
