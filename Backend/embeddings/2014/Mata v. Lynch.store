that a party could ask the commission to change one of \n\n23 its earlier decisions. \n\n24  It could file a motion for reconsideration, \n\n25 simply suggesting that the law was wrong, the earlier\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n1 decision was simply incorrect on the same record.  The \n\n2 court held that that is not reviewable.  Or the party \n\n3 could file a motion to reopen with new evidence \n\n4 attached, which would be reviewable.  And what the court \n\n5 said was that in determining whether the court of \n\n6 appeals had jurisdiction over the petition for review, \n\n7 it didn\u0027t need to focus on how the agency characterized \n\n8 its order.  It could focus on whether that order was \n\n9 reviewable. \n\n10  So in this case, Petitioner acknowledges \n\n11 that if equitable tolling is unavailable, his motion to \n\n12 reopen was untimely.  If he filed 115 days, his only \n\n13 argument in favor of timeliness is equitable tolling. \n\n14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I\u0027m ­­ I\u0027m a \n\n15

The question is \n\n19 whether the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in this \n\n20 case in holding it has no jurisdiction to review \n\n21 Petitioner\u0027s request that the board equitably tolled the \n\n22 90­day deadline on his motion to reopen as a result of \n\n23 ineffective assistance of counsel.  We granted review on \n\n24 that. \n\n25  As far as what the Fifth Circuit said, among\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\n1 other things it says, it lacks jurisdiction to review \n\n2

no, we won\u0027t equitably do that because it\u0027s not going to \n\n9 make any difference, basically.  You weren\u0027t really \n\n10 prejudiced. \n\n11  Okay.

asked the court of appeals to reexamine its holding in \n\n15 Ramos­Bonilla that motions to reopen are not subject to \n\n16 equitable tolling.  So at least before the court of \n\n17 appeals, Petitioner saw the Fifth Circuit\u0027s \n\n18 jurisprudence the same way that we did. \n\n19  Now, because, in the Fifth Circuit, \n\n20 equitable tolling of the 90­day deadline is unavailable, \n\n21 the Board of Immigration Appeals could have granted \n\n22 relief only by exercising its sua sponte authority to \n\n23 reopen.

Mr. Chief Justice, we think \n\n14 the difference here is that the deadline isn\u0027t simply a \n\n15 question of whether the board was right or wrong in \n\n16 denying the statutory motion.  We see the timeliness as \n\n17 the key distinction between whether the board\u0027s \n\n18 discretion was unfettered on reopening or fettered on \n\n19 reopening.  And so the first question as we see it ­­\n\n20 that is how we distinguish orders denying statutory \n\n21 motions to reopen from orders denying motions to reopen \n\n22 sua sponte. \n\n23  And so the first question we would say that \n\n24 a court of appeals would need to address is whether the \n\n25 alien\u0027s motion to reopen before the Board of Immigration\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Appeals was timely. \n\n2  If that motion was untimely, then it rested \n\n3 solely in the board\u0027s discretion whether to grant or \n\n4 deny reopening.  And for that reason, under Heckler v. \n\n5 Chaney, under Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the \n\n6 Fifth Circuit properly dismissed for lack of \n\n7 jurisdiction. \n\n8  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you deny that the \n\n9 plaintiff here ­­ that Petitioner thought that he was \n\n10
