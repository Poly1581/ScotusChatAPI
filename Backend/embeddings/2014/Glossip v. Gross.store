disagreements about proper legal standards, all parties \n\n5 agree that Petitioners bear the threshold burden of \n\n6 establishing that there is a substantial or objectively \n\n7 intolerable risk that they will feel the pain from the \n\n8 second and third drugs. \n\n9  Unless that finding of fact, a finding of \n\n10 fact affirmed by the court of appeals, mirrored by three \n\n11 other trial courts in Florida, affirmed by three other \n\n12 appeals courts in Florida, is set aside, they cannot \n\n13 satisfy that threshold burden.  Now ­­\n\n14  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wyrick, as ­­ as I \n\n15 understand it, there were three subsidiary findings that \n\n16 underlay this conclusion. \n\n17  The first is the one that we talked a little \n\n18 bit about with Ms. Konrad, which has to do with the \n\n19 ceiling effect, which, as I understand it you, don\u0027t at \n\n20 all defend. \n\n21  The second is the idea that 500 milligrams \n\n22 of this drug would likely kill a patient in 30 minutes \n\n23 or an hour, which seems to me irrelevant given that a \n\n24 lethal dose is completely consistent with unbearable \n\n25 pain.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n27\n\n1  And the third is that that dose of midazolam \n\n2 would keep a patient unconscious while a needle is \n\n3 inserted into his thigh, which also seems irrelevant \n\n4 given the ­­ what everybody understands to be the much, \n\n5 much, much greater potential for pain of potassium \n\n6 chloride. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"24","file_name":"Glossip v.
