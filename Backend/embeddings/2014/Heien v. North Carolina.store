Court has said in the Krull and Davis cases, that you\n\n2 take into account things like police manuals, court \n\n3 decisions, and the rest.  The Court has embraced that in \n\n4 its remedy jurisprudence, but in Whren has said that is \n\n5 off limits as to the Fourth Amendment. \n\n6  Now, I think there\u0027s also an element of your \n\n7 question asking about what if ­­ all that the officer \n\n8 was worried about was the safety on the roadway.  That \n\n9 would be a very different case.  Again, I\u0027m going to \n\n10 turn the Court to Whren, where the Court said that if \n\n11 there\u0027s a stop done for reasons aside from probable \n\n12 cause, then the purpose of that stop, such as the \n\n13 community caretaking function, might kick in.  But of \n\n14 course the State hasn\u0027t made any argument in that \n\n15 respect in this case because the record is quite clear \n\n16

What you\u0027re complaining about here is the \n\n20 admission of what was discovered in the search of the \n\n21 car, right? \n\n22  Now, what difference does it make whether \n\n23

Court divided that Federal law question into two pieces. \n\n10 And when the lower court had only addressed the first \n\n11 piece of the case, the Court reversed on that first \n\n12 piece of the case and sent it back down.  So I think \n\n13 what I\u0027m asking for isn\u0027t terribly different. \n\n14  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sent it back down for that \n\n15 court to decide the other piece.  But this Court will \n\n16 not decide the other piece, as you acknowledge. \n\n17  MR. FISHER:  If a State makes that choice \n\n18 that it\u0027s going to give a more favorable remedy, then \n\n19 federalism should respect that choice, Justice Scalia. \n\n20  And so I\u0027d like to reserve the rest of my \n\n21 time. \n\n22

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n\n2  MR. MONTGOMERY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please \n\n3  the Court: \n\n4 The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and \n\n5  seizures, but it does not require that police officers \n\n6  be perfect.  Because the touchstone of the Fourth \n\n7  Amendment is reasonableness, all that is required is \n\n8  that a police officer have a reasonable view of the \n\n9  facts and apply those facts to a reasonable \n\n10  understanding of the law. \n\n11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When will we ever get an \n\n12

Mr. Montgomery, I take it \n\n13 that one of Mr. Fisher\u0027s arguments, maybe his primary \n\n14 argument, is that this just looks like a remedies \n\n15

 MR. MONTGOMERY:  The confusion comes in ­­\n\n18 the confusion comes in, Justice Scalia, in the last \n\n19 sentence of subsection (g) on appendix page 3, which \n\n20 says, \"The stop lamp may be incorporated into a unit \n\n21 with one or more other rear lamps.\"  Where the confusion \n\n22 comes in is that sentence would seem to imply that the \n\n23

even when the Court has cited these cases, they\u0027re all \n\n12 in the pre­Leon context where this Court didn\u0027t\n\n13 distinguish rights from remedies. \n\n14  If you want to look at the founding, the \n\n15 controlling rule would be the common law rule.  And as \n\n16 we said in our brief, with no ­­ with no disagreement \n\n17 from the other side, the common law rule dating back \n\n18 centuries was that ignorance of the law on the police \n\n19 officer\u0027s part, even if it was perfectly reasonable, \n\n20 didn\u0027t justify the stop. \n\n21  And if I could say one last thing to Justice \n\n22 Scalia about the colloquies we were having before, with \n\n23 all due respect, I really do think there is nothing \n\n24 unusual about a party litigating a case up through the \n\n25 courts.  It may arise in Federal court or it may arise \n\n56\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nOfficial\n\n1 in State court, but they can choose the arguments they\n\n2 choose to raise. \n\n3  And when we got a judgment in our favor from \n\n4 the North Carolina court of appeals, it was up to the \n\n5 State at that point to choose what arguments it wanted \n\n6 to pursue further in this case.  So just like a State \n\n7 may ­­ a party may ride the First Amendment instead of \n\n8 the Second or a rights question instead of remedy, we \n\n9 think that\u0027s all that\u0027s happened here. \n\n10  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
