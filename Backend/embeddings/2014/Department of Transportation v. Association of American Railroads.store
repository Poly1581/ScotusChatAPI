 The court of appeals held that Section 207 \n\n12 of PRIIA was unconstitutional because it believed that \n\n13 the statute constituted an actual delegation of \n\n14 regulatory authority to a private entity.  And none of \n\n15 those three things is true about this statute. \n\n16  First, under Lebron, Amtrak should not be \n\n17

longstanding statutory preference requirement, which was \n\n21 enacted by Congress, not Amtrak, and is enforced by an \n\n22 independent adjudicative agency, the Surface \n\n23 Transportation Board.

You do have the Model Penal Code. \n\n13 We have law professors telling judges what to do all the \n\n14 time.  We have judges who receive information in briefs. \n\n15

case that\u0027s not a situation where you have a company \n\n13 trying to regulate other competitors in the market. \n\n14 That is one difference.  Another difference is that a \n\n15 lot of these organizations tender their proposed \n\n16 standards to the agency for approval.  So at the end of \n\n17 the day, it\u0027s the agency that has the final say in many \n\n18 cases.  That\u0027s this model that Congress enacted. \n\n19  And here, Congress plainly could have given \n\n20 Amtrak an advisory role, Section 207 (a) gives all sorts \n\n21

 MR. DUPREE:  Well, Justice Alito, I think in \n\n6 that situation what would likely happen if Amtrak and \n\n7 the freight railroad could not reach agreement and \n\n8 therefore there was no agreement on the terms of the \n\n9 operating agreement, is that the Surface Transportation \n\n10 Board ultimately would be called upon to step in and \n\n11 essentially dictate terms or help the parties reach \n\n12 terms and proscribe the terms of the operating \n\n13 agreement.  And I think in that situation ­­ again, it \n\n14 hasn\u0027t yet arisen but it would not surprise me in the \n\n15 slightest if Amtrak\u0027s argument at that point to the \n\n16 Surface Transportation Board was pointing to the \n\n17 language of 207 (c) and saying, this freight railroad is \n\n18 under a statutory mandate that it shall amend its \n\n19 agreements to the extent practicable.  And nothing in \n\n20 the statute suggests that the determination as to \n\n21 practicability is something that falls within the \n\n22 exclusive jurisdiction of the freight railroads.  The \n\n23 statutory language doesn\u0027t suggest that.  If this Court \n\n24 were to hold that, I certainly wouldn\u0027t quarrel with it, \n\n25 but I\u0027m not quite sure the statutory language gets you\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\n1 there. \n\n2  I think one fundamental flaw with the \n\n3 statute which we\u0027ve not yet touched on, an additional \n\n4 flaw, is the problem of accountability.  That, of \n\n5 course, is the concern that has animated this Court\u0027s ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"31","file_name":"Department

Well, first, I would take issue \n\n8 with just the label.  In other words, the organic \n\n9 statute of Amtrak in the US Code says it is not the \n\n10 government.  So it may be a little more than just a \n\n11 label. \n\n12  But taking Your Honor\u0027s point, I think what \n\n13 makes Amtrak not the government for nondelegation \n\n14

keep in mind, we are not neutral government regulators, \n\n23 we are hungry capitalists.  That\u0027s how we run Amtrak. \n\n24 We have a ­­\n\n25  JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.

there would be need. \n\n14  I think that Mr. Dupree also is concerned \n\n15 about the need for Amtrak\u0027s consent here.  This goes \n\n16 back to the very  first argument that we have in our \n\n17 brief that under cases like Currin and Rock Royal \n\n18 Cooperative, the fact that the government needed to \n\n19 secure the consent of Amtrak is not something that makes \n\n20 that a delegation outside the government.  Even though \n\n21 they had the pen along the way, the veto power is what \n\n22 is most important, and we think it\u0027s especially easy to \n\n23 get there in the context of an entity like Amtrak which \n\n24 is, at worst, for us quasi­private rather than entirely \n\n25
