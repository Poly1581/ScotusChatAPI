find the facts.  Courts of Appeals review those \n\n13 fact­findings deferentially under Rule 52.  The Federal \n\n14 courts apply that familiar standard, even whenever the \n\n15 ultimate question is one of law, but it rests on \n\n16 subsidiary fact­finding. \n\n17  Now, the Federal Circuit says that claim \n\n18 construction is different, that there are no facts in \n\n19

I think that that\u0027s basically \n\n7 right, Justice Breyer.  Though in this case, we have an \n\n8 expert who came in to testify about why these terms have \n\n9 a particular meaning. \n\n10

I think that, first, because of the way preclusion \n\n21 works, it only runs against the patentee.  All right. \n\n22 So if the patentee loses on an issue of claim \n\n23

in the various courts that reach different results.  So \n\n11 the mere fact that ­­ that this binds the public is ­­\n\n12 is not conclusive. \n\n13  MS. ANDERS:  I think  that’s right.

You can say that\u0027s related to the patent because of \n\n16 course the patent uses SEC and one question is what kind\n\n17 of data does it produce.  But it is also a finding of \n\n18 fact to say, as a general matter, the way science works \n\n19 is that SEC produces MP without further calculation. \n\n20  JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that sounds like every \n\n21 factual finding.

Thank you, Mr.\n\nChief Justice, \n\n16 and may it please the Court: \n\n17  It seems to me that the two questions that\n\n18 were asked in the opening portions to my colleagues and \n\n19
