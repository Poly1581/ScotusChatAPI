the Ninth Circuit on an argument that was never \n\n2 presented to it? \n\n3  MS. VAN AKEN:  I ­­ I disagree, Your Honor. \n\n4 In the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco argued that the ­­\n\n5 the Ninth Circuit should adopt essentially the Fifth \n\n6 Circuit\u0027s rule, that where there are exigent \n\n7 circumstances, that there is no requirement of \n\n8 accommodation.  There was no argument that the ADA just \n\n9 has nothing to do with arrests.  It\u0027s that in exigent \n\n10 arrests, like the Fifth Circuit said in Hainze, then you \n\n11 don\u0027t ­­ there\u0027s not a reasonable accommodation.  No \n\n12 accommodation is reasonable. \n\n13  So in a sense, the ADA doesn\u0027t apply, but \n\n14 that\u0027s because of the exigency as the Fifth Circuit said \n\n15 in Hainze, and that was the conflict that we asked this \n\n16 Court to take the case to resolve. \n\n17  JUSTICE ALITO:  Before we get to the \n\n18 question that you have briefed and the question that the \n\n19 Solicitor General has briefed, there is another question \n\n20 that logically comes first.  The statute, 42 U.S.C. \n\n21 12132, says, \"No qualified individual with a disability \n\n22 shall, by reason of such disability, be subjected to \n\n23 discrimination by any such entity.\"  That\u0027s the relevant \n\n24 statutory provision, isn\u0027t it? \n\n25  MS. VAN AKEN:  Yes, Justice.  Yes.\n\n6","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"4","file_name":"City and County of San Francisco v.

that, I ­­ I\u0027m still not entirely satisfied with your \n\n3 answer about discrimination.  We have to answer that \n\n4 question before we get to the arguments that you make \n\n5 and that the United States makes based on regulations \n\n6 that have been issued pursuant to the statute. \n\n7  If discrimination means what it means in \n\n8 ordinary parlance, which means treating people \n\n9 differently, then there would be no basis for those \n\n10 regulations.  But nobody\u0027s briefed this other issue, \n\n11 this threshold issue.  Now, maybe you\u0027re right.  But it \n\n12 hadn\u0027t been briefed. \n\n13  MS. VAN AKEN:  Well, I ­­ I think \n\n14 discrimination includes the failure to make an \n\n15 accommodation where it\u0027s reasonable to do so, and I base \n\n16 that on the findings, as I mentioned.  I base that on \n\n17 the regulations, which this Court said in ­­ in Bragdon \n\n18 were entitled to deference, at least in the ­­ the \n\n19 public accommodations context.  Congress has recognized \n\n20 the reasonable accommodation duty in 42 U.S.C. 12206, \n\n21 which ­­ which was subsequently enacted but mentions \n\n22 accommodations. \n\n23  And I also think it ­­ it sort of follows \n\n24 from this context.  The public service here is providing \n\n25

 MR. GERSHENGORN:  We don\u0027t believe that \n\n8 should have known is the standard in the ADA.  So it\u0027s \n\n9 not a should have known standard with respect to the \n\n10 disability. \n\n11  With respect to how the Court should \n\n12 approach this, and the question that we understand to \n\n13 presented and whether it should adopt the Hainze \n\n14 approach.  We have proposed for the Court that it apply \n\n15 the Barnett standard.  The root of that standard is the \n\n16 recognition that in the mine run of cases like this, \n\n17 with an armed and violent individual, it would be a \n\n18 great danger to the officers or to the public, and short \n\n19 time.  And so consistent with the Justice Department \n\n20

operationalize that instinct and map it onto this \n\n24 Court\u0027s precedent is through a Barnett standard, which \n\n25

Mr. ­­ Mr. Feldman, do you \n\n24 agree with the Solicitor General\u0027s standard here, and \n\n25 you just disagree on the facts, or do you disagree with\n\n35\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 the Solicitor General\u0027s standard? \n\n2  MR. FELDMAN:  No.  We disagree very \n\n3 strenuously with any notion that a special circumstances \n\n4 test should apply here. \n\n5  Looking at the U.S. Airways case, the Court \n\n6 adopted that test for very good reasons.  And it was \n\n7 because, in that case, there was a direct conflict \n\n8 between the proposed accommodation and the employer\u0027s \n\n9 seniority rules.  So in that circumstance, the Court \n\n10 added a burden to the plaintiff. \n\n11  That isn\u0027t our case.  In our case, we have \n\n12 symmetry between the proposed accommodation, on the one \n\n13 hand, and the way that San Francisco trains its officers \n\n14 and also universally accepted methods for dealing with \n\n15 mentally disabled individuals.  So we\u0027re not in a \n\n16 situation where we need to adopt a special circumstances \n\n17 test.  And as was noted earlier, I don\u0027t know what it \n\n18 means, and I don\u0027t know how a police officer can \n\n19

themselves, as I think they already do under Graham v. \n\n18 Connor, is there an immediate threat to the public, and \n\n19 is that a threat that we can eliminate somehow? \n\n20

similar facts, and they\u0027re both cited by the Ninth \n\n17 Circuit in its decision below.  One was Alexander and \n\n18 the other was Diorro. \n\n19  Alexander is a particularly interesting case \n\n20 because the defendant there was the City and County of \n\n21 San Francisco.  So if they were aware of any case, you \n\n22 would think that would be one of them.  The plaintiff in \n\n23 Alexander was mentally ill.  The officers arrived at his \n\n24 house to execute an administrative warrant, and rather \n\n25 than allow them to do it, the plaintiff there threatened\n\n49\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 to shoot anyone who entered his house.  And it\u0027s the \n\n2 exact same circumstances we have here.  The situation \n\n3 was contained, there was no need to immediately enter \n\n4 and the officers made the decision to go in in \n\n5 circumstances that led to a violent outcome.  And the \n\n6 Ninth Circuit held that the officers there were not \n\n7 entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law \n\n8 because the extent of the threat was unknown and \n\n9 disputed.  So it ­­ it raised a jury question. \n\n10  Diorro is the other case that the Ninth \n\n11 Circuit cited.  Diorro stands for the proposition that \n\n12 where an officer knows that an individual\u0027s mentally \n\n13

determining what force is appropriate under the Fourth \n\n15 Amendment.  And we have very clear testimony from the \n\n16 officers here that at least when Reynolds made the \n\n17

that he was unarmed in the sense that he didn\u0027t have a \n\n24 knife or a gun.  What he had, though, was lighters \n\n25 fluid.

the Court took this case because there\u0027s a division in \n\n8 the circuits about the weight that they give to exigency \n\n9 and safety concerns in dangerous arrests like this one. \n\n10 I don\u0027t think there could be any question that in the \n\n11 Fifth Circuit, in the Fourth Circuit, where exigency has \n\n12 a lot of weight in the reasonableness analysis, that \n\n13 this case would have come out differently.  And I think \n\n14 that\u0027s the fundamental legal difference between the \n\n15
