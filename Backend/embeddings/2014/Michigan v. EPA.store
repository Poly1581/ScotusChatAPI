 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I agree, Justice Alito, \n\n19  that Congress proposed different treatment for power\n\n20  plants, but that doesn\u0027t answer the question.  That just \n\n21  asks the question.  The question is what different \n\n22  treatment did Congress prescribe.  Now, what Petitioners \n\n23  are arguing is that what Congress prescribed and mandated \n\n24  was a cost­benefit analysis that does not apply to any \n\n25  other source of hazardous pollutants. \n\n45\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1

 though for every other source, regulation would proceed \n\n5  immediately; for power plants, there was uncertainty \n\n6  about whether power plants emitted hazardous pollutants \n\n7  at a level that would cause a problem, whether the acid \n\n8  rain regulations would solve the problem, and whether \n\n9  there were alternative control strategies available. \n\n10  And so ­­ if I may.  I\u0027m sorry. \n\n11  EPA ­­ what Congress told EPA to do was to \n\n12  study those three things.  Those go to health \n\n13  considerations.  And then once EPA was ­­ made a \n\n14  judgment about that, it was to decide whether to list \n\n15  power plants for regulation as ­­ whether it was \n\n16
