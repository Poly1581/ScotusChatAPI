different category of directional, it\u0027s important to the \n\n16 speech of the church, inviting the community and saying \n\n17 come worship with us, and here is where we are located. \n\n18  And what\u0027s interesting about that, if the \n\n19 church, for example, says we\u0027re meeting now at a senior \n\n20

 MR. CORTMAN:  But I think the problem is \n\n23 there ­­ there already is that here, because we have an \n\n24 unlimited number of political signs.  And so if the \n\n25 streets are already littered in an unlimited number of\n\n15\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 political signs, which they are, then how serious is the \n\n2 town\u0027s interest to reduce clutter?  And I think that\u0027s \n\n3 the problem.  The way to reduce clutter is to say, for \n\n4 example, many different ways, you can only have one sign \n\n5 per block, five signs total.  It could only be a certain \n\n6 size. \n\n7  But it\u0027s hard to take the interests \n\n8 seriously of reducing clutter when it allows political \n\n9 signs to clutter the entire town in an unlimited number \n\n10 for the entire year.  The church\u0027s signs or an event \n\n11 signs are not the problem.  What we have here is ­­ is \n\n12 carte blanche authority for political signs to clutter \n\n13 the landscape, unlimited in number for the entire year, \n\n14 and yet the concern is for maybe a few more signs that \n\n15 may be placed. \n\n16  JUSTICE ALITO:  Can the town say that signs \n\n17 relating to a one­time event, an election or anything \n\n18 else that occurs on a particular date, have to be taken \n\n19 down within a period of time after that event?  And if \n\n20 can say that, isn\u0027t that content­based, the way you \n\n21 define that concept? ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"14","file_name":"Reed v.

there are many ways for the locality to regulate those \n\n9 signs.  For example, if it doesn\u0027t want many signs, it \n\n10 can say one person can put up a temporary sign or a \n\n11 permanent sign or whatever have you. \n\n12  But to say, for example, you could put up a \n\n13 private sign because you think this one location is \n\n14 interesting, what if another person has a location they \n\n15 want people to come visit?  Should the government be \n\n16 able to say, well, we think your location is important, \n\n17

context­specific intermediate scrutiny approach should \n\n10 apply in evaluating speech­permissive exceptions to a \n\n11 sign ordinance where those exceptions are based on the \n\n12 same longstanding traditional rationales that justify \n\n13 the sign ordinance as a whole. \n\n14  A wooden application of strict scrutiny in \n\n15 this context would suggest that it\u0027s presumptively \n\n16 unconstitutional, for example, for a town to limit signs \n\n17 on public property but have an exception if you want to \n\n18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you use those labels \n\n24  in the context of the First Amendment, do they mean the\n\n25  same thing that they mean in equal protection?

 couple of flavors of intermediate scrutiny, both under \n\n5  the Constitution at large and under the First Amendment \n\n6  in particular.  I think here we would be urging \n\n7  something more like a reasonable fit test, which we \n\n8  think would give municipalities enough room to draw the \n\n9  kinds of distinctions that I think they reasonably \n\n10  should be able to make between painting your street \n\n11  number on your curb so people can more easily find your \n\n12  house and restrictions on, you know, particular types of \n\n13

 fair amount of teeth in the circumstance, I mean, and \n\n17  we\u0027re putting our money where our mouth is because we \n\n18  think that the particular ordinance at issue here fails \n\n19  intermediate scrutiny. \n\n20  But intermediate scrutiny would give \n\n21  municipalities enough room to draw these kinds of \n\n22  distinctions and to draw, in particular, the kinds of \n\n23

 Thank you. \n\n4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. \n\n5  Mr. Savrin. \n\n6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN \n\n7  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS \n\n8  MR. SAVRIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it \n\n9  please the Court: \n\n10  The problem with applying strict scrutiny in \n\n11  this case or this type of case is that it will have, we \n\n12  believe, the opposite effect.  It will limit speech \n\n13  because towns, cities will enact one size fits all.  In \n\n14  order to do that, as Petitioner\u0027s counsel indicated, \n\n15  there need to be limitations on the number of signs, on \n\n16  the duration of signs.  The signs would have to be all \n\n17  large enough to accommodate the largest message that \n\n18  needs to be communicated. \n\n19  And in order to pass strict scrutiny, the \n\n20  legislatures in these towns and cities across this \n\n21  country would be inclined to ban all signs except those \n\n22  that the First Amendment absolutely allows. \n\n23  JUSTICE ALITO:  You can make that argument \n\n24  in all kinds of contexts.  I don\u0027t know where it gets \n\n25  you.  Suppose that the question is, whether the town is \n\n33\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  going to allow anybody to speak in a park, and the\n\n2  town ­­ the town council says, well, you know, we would \n\n3  like to have people be able to speak on subjects that we \n\n4  like, but there are some subjects we really don\u0027t like. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"32","file_name":"Reed

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you see that sign at \n\n9  all when you pass in a moving car?\n\n10  MR. SAVRIN:  Yes.  In fact, the court of \n\n11  appeals has found that it functioned as intended and \n\n12  there is no indication that ­­ that it did not.  So \n\n13  there\u0027s ­­ it seems to me that those are the kind of \n\n14  decisions, as far as size, duration, are ones that \n\n15  should be the fodder  of legislative deliberation.  And \n\n16  as long as it meets the intermediate scrutiny test, it \n\n17  should pass Constitutional muster. \n\n18  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whatever that is.  Whatever \n\n19  that is, right? \n\n20  MR. SAVRIN:  Well, the intermediate scrutiny \n\n21  test, I think, is if it\u0027s narrowly tailored, and also if \n\n22  there are alternative modes of communication.  But I \n\n23  think that applying strict scrutiny to these types of \n\n24  regulations will result in sign ordinances being struck \n\n25  down uniformly, just about, and the only speech that ­­\n\n48\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1  that will be allowed will be speech that is\n\n2  constitutionally required.  Everything else will not be. \n\n3  But I think the problem, if there is one, \n\n4  that Gilbert has gotten into is that it allows a lot of \n\n5  speech that a lot of other ordinances might not in a lot \n\n6  of different formats. \n\n7  JUSTICE KAGAN:
