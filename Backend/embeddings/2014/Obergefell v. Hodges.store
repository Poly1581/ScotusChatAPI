 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it\u0027s not a plural \n\n18 relationship?  What if one State says that individuals \n\n19 can marry at the age of puberty?  So a 12­year­old \n\n20 female can marry.  Would a State ­­ would another State \n\n21 be obligated to recognize that marriage? \n\n22  MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:  I ­­ I think \n\n23 probably not.  But the State would have, in that \n\n24 instance, a sufficiently important interest in \n\n25 protecting the true consent of the married person.\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\n8\n\nOfficial\n\n1

 But what we see, in fact, is that, quite in \n\n5 contrast to the non­recognition laws at issue here, the \n\n6 States do recognize the marriages of person who, by age, \n\n7 would not have been able to marry within their own \n\n8 States. \n\n9  That is the long­standing practice of all of \n\n10 the States, precisely because of the abomination, as it \n\n11 was referred to in the old treatises, of the notion that \n\n12 a ­­ persons could have a different marital state in \n\n13 some jurisdictions than others. \n\n14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sir, how about the \n\n15 consanguinity situation?  Virtually all states would \n\n16 recognize cousins through marriage getting married, but \n\n17

interest in only permitting opposite­sex couples to \n\n6 marry is to increase the birthrate.  Well, now apply \n\n7 that theory to same­sex couples who are already married. \n\n8 They are already married in the States where they were \n\n9 married.  They are already married in half the States in \n\n10 the country. \n\n11  Kentucky would have the Court believe that \n\n12

Kentucky in order to procreate biologically even though \n\n16 the couple may already have children together.  That, I \n\n17 would dare say, is not a rational justification, much \n\n18 less a sufficiently important one. \n\n19  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think ­­ I think \n\n20
