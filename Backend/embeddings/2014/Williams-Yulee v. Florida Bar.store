 Florida punished the candidate seeking \n\n11 election to judicial office because she signed form \n\n12 letters and a Web posting soliciting contributions to \n\n13 her campaign committee, contributions that were \n\n14 completely lawful under Florida law.  The First \n\n15 Amendment bars Florida from prohibiting that speech. \n\n16  The threshold question, of course, is what \n\n17 standard of review.  We submit that strict scrutiny \n\n18 applies, the standard that was applied by the court \n\n19 below, for several reasons.

that if all we\u0027re talking about is the dignity of a \n\n6 judge who is going around with a hat, I think that \n\n7 probably would not be sufficient for this Court to \n\n8 uphold it.  But ­­\n\n9

of the judiciary, call it the public shouldn\u0027t perceive \n\n16 of judges as being political officers, so we shouldn\u0027t \n\n17 say an election for a judge is the same thing as an \n\n18

 But what I\u0027m saying is, clearly, when you \n\n15 tell an incumbent judge that that judge can personally\n\n16 solicit money, that\u0027s going to give an incumbent judge, \n\n17 who has far more intimidation power, an advantage over a \n\n18 non­incumbent.  And as to weighing which is going to \n\n19 give more or less advantage, it\u0027s difficult to answer \n\n20

good judges and care more about it than the average \n\n12 citizen does. \n\n13  MR. RICHARD:  I think that\u0027s absolutely \n\n14 true, Your Honor.  But I think that what we\u0027re concerned \n\n15 about is the two things that this Court has identified \n\n16 in the past, which is avoiding the potential for \n\n17 corruption that the Court has found is inherent in the \n\n18 quid pro quo relationship; and, as importantly, avoiding \n\n19 the appearance of corruption that the public sees. \n\n20  And if I can address one more thing, Your \n\n21 Honor, because I am responding to your question, I \n\n22 understand that Your Honor does not believe that Buckley \n\n23 was decided correctly and the day may come when Your \n\n24 Honor persuades this Court to recede from the parts that \n\n25 are applicable here.  But in the meantime, I think that\n\n49\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 it is reasonable to urge the Court respectfully that the \n\n2 same rules that apply or at least the minimum degree to \n\n3 which the Court has applied these rules to the other two \n\n4 branches, needs to be applied to the judicial branch. \n\n5 But there\u0027s certainly no basis ­­ it would be totally \n\n6 inappropriate to carve out a right that judges have that \n\n7 the Court has not accorded to the other two branches, and \n\n8 that this case is an example of where that consistency is \n\n9 important. \n\n10  Thank you, Your Honor. \n\n11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"48","file_name":"Williams-Yulee v.
