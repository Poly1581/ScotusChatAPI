 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER \n\n9  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS \n\n10  MR. KELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, \n\n11 and may it please the Court: \n\n12  Messages on Texas license plates are \n\n13 government speech.  The State of Texas etches its name \n\n14 onto each license plate and Texas law gives the State \n\n15 sole control and final approval authority over \n\n16 everything that appears on a license plate.  As in \n\n17 Summum, Texas is not abridging any traditional free \n\n18 speech rights.  Motorists remain free to speak in all \n\n19 sorts of ways, including on their cars through a bumper \n\n20 sticker right next to a license plate, or a car­size \n\n21 paint job or a window decal. \n\n22  But the First Amendment does not mean that a \n\n23 motorist can compel any government to place its \n\n24
