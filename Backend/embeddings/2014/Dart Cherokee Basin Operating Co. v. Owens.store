apologize for going back to this not merits question, \n\n6 but on the question of why the Tenth Circuit did what it\n\n7 did, Judge Hartz, who was, of course, dissenting from \n\n8 denial, made reference to the fact ­­ and I\u0027m just \n\n9 quoting here ­­ that the judges were very busy, and the \n\n10 appeal presented a knotty matter that requires a \n\n11 decision in short order. \n\n12  So even he, who was trying to suggest that \n\n13 an appeal should have been taken, was not suggesting \n\n14 that the court did what it did because the court agreed \n\n15 with the trial court. \n\n16  MR. BERRETH:  Well, in a case like this \n\n17 where all parties agree that there\u0027s a case in the court \n\n18 of appeals, so that there is jurisdiction under Section \n\n19 1254, the Forsyth v. Hammond case confirms that this \n\n20 Court has the power, the certiorari power to ­­ to look \n\n21 to the whole case, to look to any aspects of the case. \n\n22  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought Hohn, which \n\n23 I think you used as explaining why the case is in the \n\n24 court of appeals, but Hohn said the only thing that you \n\n25 can review is the COA, certificate of appealability.\n\n9\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 You can\u0027t use that handle to get to the merits. \n\n2  So the only question is whether the \n\n3 certificate was improperly denied and not the merits. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"7","file_name":"Dart

difference in that case was that the government conceded \n\n6 error.  Government conceded that the merits question was \n\n7 not in dispute.  So this Court didn\u0027t need to go ahead \n\n8

this is Nixon v. Fitzgerald.  And in that case, the \n\n7 court did both steps.  The court took both steps. \n\n8  The court, number one, confirmed that it had \n\n9 jurisdiction under Section 1254, which exists here; all \n\n10 parties agree.  And number two, the court in Nixon v. \n\n11 Fitzgerald went ahead and addressed the merits question, \n\n12 which is what we asked the Court to do in this case, \n\n13 because if the Court doesn\u0027t go ahead and address the \n\n14 merits question in this case, there is a high likelihood \n\n15 that the merits question won\u0027t be addressed, and that \n\n16 we\u0027ll have one circuit alone that has this requirement \n\n17 out there that flouts congressional intent. \n\n18  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The reason is that any \n\n19 careful lawyer in the Tenth Circuit will ­­ will know \n\n20 that we ­­ we\u0027d better put the evidence in the notice of \n\n21 removal.  So a lawyer is not going to risk failing to do \n\n22 that to make ­­ to correct the Tenth Circuit\u0027s error. \n\n23  MR. BERRETH:  That\u0027s right.  And ­­ and this \n\n24

the amount in controversy, that sounds very strange to \n\n16 me.  Most class action plaintiffs are not going to \n\n17 contest that their claim is worth at least $500,000. \n\n18  MR. SHARP:  Well, in this particular case, \n\n19 this case really isn\u0027t worth $5 million.  So there was \n\n20 nothing ­­ no way, though, at that point for us to \n\n21 contest one way or another.  If the plaintiff is going \n\n22 to make any kind of a contest, there has to be some \n\n23 presentation of evidence to begin with.  There\u0027s not \n\n24 going to be anything other than a plaintiff saying if ­­\n\n25 if the simple allegation is, well, it\u0027s worth more than\n\n41\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 $5 million, plaintiff has nothing. \n\n2  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I don\u0027t follow that \n\n3 because ordinarily a plaintiff would state what the \n\n4 plaintiff\u0027s damages are. \n\n5  MR. SHARP:  Plaintiff in a class action \n\n6 generally does not have the evidence of how many class \n\n7 members there are or how much they\u0027ve been damaged. \n\n8 It\u0027s the defendant that deals with all of the class \n\n9 members on a class­wide or company­wide basis.  The \n\n10 plaintiff generally does not have that information \n\n11 available, defendant does, and it usually has to be \n\n12 determined through a discovery process which usually \n\n13 occurs in State court, at which point the defendant \n\n14 sends a request for admissions or ask at a deposition. ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"42","file_name":"Dart
