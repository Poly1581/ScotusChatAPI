what their recovery is going to be given default.  That \n\n5 is true. \n\n6  What I was responding to is the notion that \n\n7 banks may have relied on, you know, whether this Court \n\n8 would apply Dewsnup to completely underwater mortgages. \n\n9 I think that\u0027s a little bit less strong, although it\u0027s \n\n10 true that in the 25 years since Dewsnup, it\u0027s ­­ until \n\n11 this decision by the Eleventh Circuit, it\u0027s been well \n\n12 established that Dewsnup does apply to completely \n\n13 underwater liens. \n\n14  May I reserve the balance of my time? \n\n15

seems as though it\u0027s the second half of the sentence \n\n24 that is key here.  Why are we doing this?  Why are we \n\n25 holding this?  Because the claim is secured by a lien \n\n35\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 and because the claim has been fully allowed.  And both \n\n2 of those things also apply here. \n\n3  MR. BIBAS:  Respondent\u0027s claim also had some\n\n4 value that made it unquestionable that it was still \n\n5 secured.  But you\u0027re ­­ you\u0027re correct.  I think, \n\n6 though, that the use of the verb \"stripped down\" and the \n\n7 use of the respondent particular limits to that \n\n8 situation. \n\n9  It\u0027s very important, though, to go back \n\n10 three sentences before that to see what the court \n\n11 hedged.  The court specifically reserved hypothetical \n\n12 applications advanced at oral argument.  Petitioner \n\n13 advanced two hypotheticals at oral argument.  One of \n\n14 those was of the completely underwater junior mortgage. \n\n15 The court said that those hypotheticals illustrate the \n\n16

In order to be a holder of secured claim, one \n\n13 must have a secured claim.  And so in Nobelman, this \n\n14 Court stressed petitioners were correct in looking to \n\n15 Section 506(a) for a judicial valuation of the \n\n16 collateral to determine the status of the bank\u0027s secured \n\n17 claim, whether there was a secured claim or not.  There \n\n18
