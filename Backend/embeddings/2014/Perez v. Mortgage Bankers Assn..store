Well, I ­­ I ­­ I think it \n\n25 depends.\n\nAnd, again, this is a principal purpose of ­­\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n6\n\n1 of what the APA did.  The APA did not prohibit an agency \n\n2 from going through notice­and­comment rulemaking or \n\n3 other ­­ or other public participation in the case of an \n\n4 interpretative rule.  It left to the agency the decision \n\n5 whether to do that.  So in some circumstances, the \n\n6 agency might choose to have very specific regulations; \n\n7 in other circumstances, the agency may choose to have \n\n8 interpretations. \n\n9  JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, things have changed \n\n10
