what bankruptcy is supposed to accomplish, which is to \n\n22 get all of the debtor\u0027s property put into the bankruptcy \n\n23 estate for distribution to creditors.  That\u0027s the \n\n24

just having appellate review after the fact.  We\u0027re \n\n4 talking here about supervision of the bankruptcy judges \n\n5 just like magistrate judges by Article III judges, \n\n6 they\u0027re appointed and removed by them.  They don\u0027t ever \n\n7 get a case unless the Court agrees to give it to them \n\n8 and that seems to me the principal difference between \n\n9

because the parties are able to make the choice and the \n\n16 courts are able to withdraw the reference.  The parties \n\n17 are always able to ask for the courts to withdraw the \n\n18 reference.  This makes it just like the bankruptcy \n\n19 system with respect to whether it\u0027s a consentable \n\n20 constitutional violation. \n\n21  And so we don\u0027t think that this is like \n\n22

are the sorts of things to which parties consent or \n\n16 those claims are waivable as they are in the magistrate \n\n17 judge context which we think is parallel. \n\n18  JUSTICE GINSBURG:

we\u0027re just applying Stern.\n\n13  But I also want to address your point about \n\n14 uniform bankruptcy code.  I think the fact that this \n\n15 Court has long said and understood and the lower courts \n\n16 have accepted that bankruptcy law takes State law and \n\n17 property rights as defined by State law as they find \n\n18 them.  That\u0027s all we\u0027re talking about here.  To the \n\n19 extent there is a State law property dispute between a \n\n20 third party and the debtor/bankruptcy trust trustee, \n\n21 that ­­ that doesn\u0027t change the uniformity of the \n\n22 bankruptcy code. \n\n23  JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I suppose the \n\n24 constitutional provision authorizing Congress to \n\n25 establish a uniform law of bankruptcy does not authorize \n\n46\n\nAlderson Reporting Company\n\nOfficial\n\n1 Congress to establish bankruptcy courts that can decide\n\n2 questions which would normally be decided by Article III \n\n3 courts. \n\n4  MR. HACKER:  That\u0027s clearly right.  You \n\n5 could establish bankruptcy law, but it\u0027s going to be an \n\n6 Article III question, the extent to which the bankruptcy \n\n7 courts can exercise judicial power. \n\n8  As to one more point on Justice Sotomayor\u0027s \n\n9 question, I had two responses.  The second one was that \n\n10 physical possession is not a great test.  As this case \n\n11 shows, Sharif as trustee didn\u0027t physically possess \n\n12 anything.  If anybody did, it was the banks where the \n\n13 trust assets were, so you can\u0027t think about it in terms ","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2014","index":"45","file_name":"Wellness

 MR. HACKER:  As ­­ as to final adjudications \n\n14 of private rights matters, magistrate judges can still \n\n15 do something, can still litigate and resolve public \n\n16 rights, whatever those kinds of rights and matters are. \n\n17 But I do think it would be difficult after this case to \n\n18 say that a magistrate can exercise judicial power of the \n\n19 United States to enter a final judgment based solely on \n\n20 consent.  I think this Court answered that question in \n\n21 Schor, effectively. \n\n22  Schor would have been an easy case, an \n\n23

And when you boil it all down, basically \n\n6 what Schor said, which is what I think the Court \n\n7 recognized in Stern, was that the structural concerns \n\n8
