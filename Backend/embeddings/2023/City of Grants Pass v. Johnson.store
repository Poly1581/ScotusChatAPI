EVANGELIS\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMS. EVANGELIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nLike cities nationwide, Grants Pass\n\nrelies on camping laws to protect its public\n\nspaces.  These generally applicable laws\n\nprohibit specific conduct and are essential to\n\npublic health and safety.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit tied cities\u0027 hands\n\nby constitutionalizing the policy debate over\n\nhow to address growing encampments.  Its holding\n\nthat the Eighth Amendment bars Grants Pass from\n\nenforcing its camping laws is wrong for three\n\nreasons.\n\nFirst, the Cruel and Unusual\n\nPunishments Clause governs which punishments are\n\npermitted, not what conduct can be prohibited.\n\nSecond, no precedent supports the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nNinth Circuit\u0027s rule.

KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn Robinson, this Court held that the\n\ngovernment cannot criminalize status.  And\n\nRespondent has conceded here today that the City\n\ncannot criminalize the status of being homeless.\n\nOur narrow submission in this case is\n\nthat government cannot circumvent the principle\n\nof Robinson by making it unlawful for a person\n\nto reside in the jurisdiction if he has that\n\nstatus.\n\nThat is what the ordinances here do.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"58","file_name":"City of Grants Pass v.

This Court has recognized\n\nthat when a punishment scheme has no penological\n\npurpose, it inflicts gratuitous suffering, and\n\nthat is cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAnd I will say, at this point, the\n\nCity has not ever identified any penological\n\npurpose for punishing homeless people who do not\n\nhave access to shelter.  If you ask that\n\nquestion, every time they pivot to encampments\n\nand fires and sanitation problems, which are all\n\nnon-sequiturs.

It\u0027s one\n\nsentence.  What that full context shows is a\n\nwide-ranging discussion about all of these\n\ndifficult policy problems and how the City was\n\ntrying to incentivize people to accept shelter\n\nand dealing with a small group that was causing\n\nserious problems and crime in the City, and\n\nthey\u0027re trying to balance those who wouldn\u0027t\n\ntake the help with the City\u0027s needs to keep\n\ntheir public spaces open.\n\nWhen the Ninth Circuit\n\nconstitutionalized this area, it left cities\n\nwith really no choice: Either keep building\n\nenough shelter that may or may not be adequate\n\nor suitable to someone\u0027s preferences, or be\n\nforced to give up all of your public spaces.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"154","file_name":"City of Grants Pass v.
