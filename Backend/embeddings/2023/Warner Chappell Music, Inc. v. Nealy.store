SHANMUGAM\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nThis case presents the question\n\nwhether a copyright plaintiff can recover\n\ndamages for acts that allegedly occurred more\n\nthan three years before the filing of suit.\n\nAs a straightforward matter of\n\nstatutory interpretation, the answer to that\n\nquestion here is no. Under the applicable\n\nstatute of limitations, a civil action must be\n\nbrought within three years after the claim\n\naccrued.  A claim accrues when the plaintiff has\n\na complete cause of action.\n\nAccordingly, as this Court repeatedly\n\nstated in Petrella, a plaintiff can obtain\n\ndamages for acts of infringement only within\n\nthree years of filing.

So I think that what\n\nthat part of the question presented did was to\n\ndirect the parties to address the substantive\n\nquestion, the availability of retrospective\n\nrelief, in light of two considerations, as you\n\nsay, first, the discovery accrual rule applied\n\nby the circuit courts and, second, the statute\n\nof limitations itself.\n\nNow our submission, as the Court will\n\nbe aware, as to the first part of that is that\n\nthere is no consensus in the courts of appeals\n\nabout the scope of the discovery rule.  There is\n\nconsensus about the existence of a discovery\n\nrule. On that issue, all of the regional\n\ncircuits have said to some extent that there is\n\na discovery rule.

is, what is the meaning of the term\n\n\"accrues\"?\n\nOur submission is simple.\n\nAs this\n\nCourt has said, the standard rule is that\n\n\"accrues\" means at the point when you have a\n\ncomplete

understand is why that has to do with the\n\nscope of the damages.  So we have \"accrues\" and\n\nwe have \"accrues\" in Section 507, which talks\n\nabout when a civil action shall be maintained.\n\nSo fine, right?  Even if I agree with\n\nyou that \"accrues\" means what you say it means,\n\nthat just -- the consequence of that, it looks\n\nlike, under this statute is that the action\n\nshall be maintained within that time frame.\n\nYou -- you seem to be arguing that if\n\nyou maintain an action within that time frame,\n\nthe three-year statute of limitations that\n\npertains to 507 is somehow transported into the\n\nconsideration of how much damages you can get.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"17","file_name":"Warner Chappell Music, Inc. v.

should be limited to\n\nfraud.\n\nWhen you look out over the court of\n\nappeals\u0027 opinions that have adopted the\n\ndiscovery rule, there is not a lot of reasoning\n\nin those opinions.  They really rely on two\n\nthings:  first, the broad-based presumption in\n\nfavor of a discovery rule that this Court cast\n\ndoubt on -- on -- in TRW and then repudiated in\n\nRotkiske and, second, the fact that the criminal\n\nstatute of limitations uses \"arises\" rather than\n\n\"accrues.\"\n\nAnd as recently as yesterday, members\n\nof the Court indicated that there\u0027s no\n\nmeaningful difference between those two terms.\n\nThe Court itself recognized as much in Petrella\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\nitself.  And the legislative history indicates\n\nthat Congress intended for those two periods to\n\nbe similar.\n\nAnd our last argument before the\n\nCourt, again, an argument that is plainly within\n\nthe scope of the question presented even if you\n\ntake the stingiest view of it, is the argument\n\nthat, at a minimum, if the Court thinks that\n\nthere is a broad discovery rule, it should\n\ncharacterize that as an equitable rule that is\n\nsubject to equitable limitations.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"21","file_name":"Warner Chappell Music, Inc. v.

The way that I interpret the question\n\npresented -- and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s very\n\ncomplicated -- is that Clause 1 of the question\n\npresented defines a term nested within Clause 2.\n\nSo Clause 2 refers to Section 507(b).\n\n507(b) uses the word \"accrue,\" okay?  What rule\n\ndetermines when a claim accrues?  Well, Clause 1\n\nof the question presented tells us what the\n\nassumption is here, which is the discovery\n\naccrual rule applied by the circuit courts tells\n\nyou when a claim accrues. And so the reason a\n\nfraud-based discovery rule doesn\u0027t work is\n\nthat\u0027s not the discovery accrual rule applied by\n\nthe circuit courts.\n\nAnother piece of potential confusion\n\nthat I think I should clear up is we -- we agree\n\nthat what the scope of the discovery rule is is\n\nnot necessary to answer the question presented.\n\nYou hold that constant and say does the\n\ndiscovery rule apply and, if so, what are the\n\nconsequences of damages.

ownership\n\nclaim. I believe that\u0027s demonstrably false.\n\nHere is what the Abbas case from the Ninth\n\nCircuit, which they cite for that proposition,\n\nsays about the discovery rule under an ownership\n\nclaim: \"Under these circumstances, a plaintiff\n\nmust bring suit within three years of receiving\n\nnotice of the repudiation of his or her\n\nownership rights.\"\n\nThat is a discovery rule.  It\u0027s a more\n\npermissive form of a discovery rule.  Inquiry\n\nnotice is not enough.  It has to be actual\n\nnotice.  And it has to be a particular type of\n\nactual notice and express repudiation.

that question is a\n\nsimple yes. If a claim is timely under 507(b),\n\nnothing in the Copyright Act imposes a separate\n\ntime-based limit on damages. This Court\u0027s\n\ndecision in Petrella rejected the idea that\n\ncourts could impose an atextual bar on recovery\n\nfor timely copyright claims, so the Second\n\nCircuit erred in relying on out-of-context\n\nlanguage from Petrella to adopt a different\n\natextual bar.\n\nSecond, Petitioners don\u0027t much defend\n\nthe Second Circuit -- Second Circuit\u0027s damages\n\nrule, perhaps because it lacks a textual basis.\n\nInstead, they\u0027re really asking the Court to\n\nanswer a different question, whether the\n\ndiscovery accrual rule applies to copyright\n\nclaims at all or at least to the claims here.\n\nBut this Court reformulated the\n\nquestion presented to exclude that question,\n\nsetting those arguments out of bounds.

But that\u0027s not the right reading\n\nof Petrella.\n\nWhat Petrella was trying to explain\n\nwas that in a case in which your claims are\n\nuntimely for acts of infringement that occurred\n\nmore than three years before you filed suit, you\n\ncan\u0027t then use claims within the limitation\n\nperiod to bootstrap in those claims.\n\nThat\u0027s the way in which the separate\n\naccrual protects both the interests of\n\ndefendants and plaintiffs.\n\nIn Petrella itself, all claims for\n\nacts that occurred more than three years before\n\nshe filed suit were untimely and she didn\u0027t try\n\nto invoke the discovery rule and couldn\u0027t have\n\ninvoked the discovery rule because MGM\u0027s\n\nexploitation of Raging Bull was so open and\n\nnotorious.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"51","file_name":"Warner Chappell Music, Inc. v.
