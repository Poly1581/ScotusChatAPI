wake of the Enron meltdown to encourage\n\nwhistleblowers to report misconduct that could\n\nthreaten the finances of millions.  The question\n\nin this case is how claims that an employer\n\nacted with retaliatory intent are to be proven.\n\nThe plain text of the statute answers\n\nthat question.  District court actions shall be\n\ngoverned by the burdens of proof in AIR21.\n\nAIR21, in turn, places exactly one burden of\n\nproof on plaintiff, to show that his protected\n\nconduct was a contributing factor in the\n\nunfavorable personnel action.\n\nThe burden then shifts to the\n\ndefendant to prove that it would have taken the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nsame unfavorable personnel action in the absence\n\nof the protected conduct, in essence, that it\n\ndid not act with retaliatory intent.\n\nThe Second Circuit held that the\n\ncontributing factor element required a showing\n\nof retaliatory intent.  UBS does not defend that\n\nholding, nor could it. UBS instead contends\n\nthat in addition to showing the contributing\n\nfactor element, a plaintiff must separately show\n\nretaliatory intent.\n\nBut UBS never grappled with the plain","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Murray v.

But, ultimately, both also are\n\nrequired as part of the plaintiff\u0027s case.\n\nI\u0027m simply unaware of any decision\n\nunder Title VII on which this was plainly framed\n\nwhere intent was not also something that the\n\nplaintiff had to show.\n\nAnd, remember, under Title VII\u0027s\n\nmotivating factor, again, the plaintiff who\n\nshows that wins.
