GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nOnce more we confront the Armed Career\n\nCriminal Act, this time with regard to which\n\ndrug schedules a sentencing court is to consult\n\nin order to determine whether a prior state drug\n\ncrime is a match with those federal schedules\n\nand, thus, either is or is not a predicate under\n\nthe ACCA.\n\nWe submit that the sentencing court\n\nshould use the schedules that are current at the\n\ntime of sentencing.  That is because, at its\n\ncore, the ACCA is a sentencing enhancement. It\n\nis not a crime unto itself.  And this Court has\n\nsaid that the ordinary practice is to apply\n\ncurrent law, including at sentencing.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n5\n\nOfficial\n\nThere\u0027s no reason to deviate from that","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Brown v.

Adler, could you\n\nspeak to the distinction between federal prior\n\nconvictions and state prior convictions and why\n\nit would be that they would be two rules, that\n\nthe federal predicates would operate with the\n\nold drug schedules and the state predicates\n\nwould operate with the new drug schedules?\n\nMR.

The reason, as we explain on page 17 of\n\nour reply brief, one possible reason at least,\n\nis that when you are doing the federal analysis,\n\nit\u0027s easy to just look at the statute of\n\nconviction.

We\u0027re\n\nassessing whether or not these prior things were\n\na serious drug offense.\n\nYour argument is just, you know, if we\n\nwere sentencing without that sort of\n\ndefinitional overlay, then we would do so based\n\non what happened with respect to the ACCA crime.\n\nBut I guess I\u0027m just confused about the\n\ndefinition of \"serious drug offense\" and how it\n\nhas any bearing on your rationale.\n\nMR. ADLER: So, Your Honor, I don\u0027t\n\nthink there\u0027s any question that the statutory\n\npenalties in ACCA are incurred the moment\n\nsomeone commits the crime.  That is the crime\n\nthat we are punishing here, right?\n\nSo we have to then view -- this is why\n\nthe government agrees, we look at the version of\n\nACCA in effect at the time of the crime, not at\n\nthe time of sentencing, at the time of the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n53\n\nOfficial","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"46","file_name":"Brown v.

your whole\n\nargument rests on treating differently a list of\n\nfive substances or any other attribute of ACCA,\n\ntreating it differently from a controlled\n\nsubstance as defined in Section 102.\n\nAnd that seems a little bit mysterious\n\nto me. I mean, if you ask why it is that\n\nCongress put in this language, \"a controlled\n\nsubstance (as defined in Section 102),\" it\u0027s,\n\nwell, number one, there are lots of controlled\n\nsubstances, and you don\u0027t want to have to list\n\nall, however many there are.  And, number two,\n\nwe expect them to change, so what\u0027s going to be\n\na controlled substance next year is not\n\nnecessarily the same as this year.\n\nAnd so, on both of those theories of\n\nwhy Congress used this language, it seems\n\nperplexing as to why you would have a different\n\nrule than you would if Congress had just listed\n\nthe substances.\n\nMR. RAYNOR: Right.  Justice Kagan, I\n\nthink one way to think about this is, if it had\n\nlisted the substances, that would reflect a\n\nstatic concern with particular substances.

the\n\nstatute itself had been -- if ACCA had been\n\namended to change the schedule, if it was more\n\ndynamic, that it would -- Petitioners would win?\n\nMR.

So, if in\n\neffect it\u0027s an amendment of ACCA, why is it\n\ntreated differently or less exactingly than an\n\nactual amendment of ACCA?\n\nMR. RAYNOR: Justice Thomas, we\n\ndisagree that this -- this is equivalent to an\n\namendment of ACCA.  We think the way to think\n\nabout this is there\u0027s the text of the ACCA and\n\nthen there\u0027s the external bodies of law that the\n\nACCA requires courts to consult.\n\nAnd it\u0027s referring courts to external\n\nbodies of law because it cares about the legal\n\nlandscape in existence at the time of the prior\n\nconviction.  The external bodies of law include\n\nboth the schedules and state law.\n\nSo just as in McNeill the Court said","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"78","file_name":"Brown v.

Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice.\n\nThe colloquies between Justice\n\nJackson, Justice Kagan, Justice Thomas\n\nillustrate why the government\u0027s position fails\n\nin this case. I\u0027d like to read you a quote from\n\nthis Court\u0027s decision in Engel versus Davenport\n\nfrom 1926.  It\u0027s on page 8 of our reply brief,\n\nand it says that the \"adoption of an earlier\n\nstatute by reference \u0027makes it as much a part of\n\nthe later act as though it had been incorporated\n\nat full length.\u0027\" That is exactly what ACCA is\n\ndoing with the controlled substances schedules.\n\nThere is no legal basis to say that\n\nACCA -- that we would win this case had Congress\n\nenumerated all of the substances, but we lose\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n95\n\nOfficial\n\nthis case just because Congress incorporated\n\nthem by reference.  But, as Mr. Raynor\n\nrepeatedly said at the podium today, that is the\n\ngovernment\u0027s position in this case.\n\nWe submit there is simply no legal\n\nbasis to draw that sort of distinction.  And we\n\nthink that is simply the end of the case.  The\n\ngovernment\u0027s remaining arguments based on\n\nMcNeill, culpability, backward-looking, all of\n\nthat prove too much because it would apply to\n\nall of the criteria in ACCA, burglary,\n\npossession, everything in ACCA, and the","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"85","file_name":"Brown v.
