They need to win on both attempts.\n\nEach is wrong and would lead to results this\n\nCourt could not have intended.\n\nFirst, Respondents say Nieves\u0027s rule,\n\ndesigned for a representative case of\n\nin-the-field law enforcement, now insulates all\n\ngovernment officials.  Picture the thin-skinned\n\nbureaucrat scouring for a crime to pin on his\n\ncritics.  According to Respondents, Section 1983\n\nhas nothing to say about that.\n\nSecond, Respondents parse Nieves like\n\na statute to say that it limits plaintiffs to a\n\nparticular type of comparative example.  To be\n\nsure, Nieves did recognize that evidence of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nsubjective motive alone would not get a\n\nplaintiff an inference that this motive caused\n\nthe adverse action.  But Nieves does not blind\n\ncourts to all but one type of objective evidence\n\nof causation.\n\nRespondents\u0027 position extends Nieves\n\nbeyond its moorings.  If the mayor in this case\n\ngot in front of TV cameras and announced that he\n\nwas going to have Ms. Gonzalez arrested because\n\nshe challenged his authority, the existence of\n\nprobable cause would make this evidence legally\n\nirrelevant.\n\nRespondents\u0027 position would also toss","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Gonzalez v.

So maybe you can\n\nexplain why that wouldn\u0027t be the case.\n\nMS. BIDWELL: Well, one of the reasons\n\nit wouldn\u0027t be the case is because of Chief\n\nJustice Rehnquist\u0027s dissent in Crawford-El,\n\nwhere, for him, one way to limit the floodgates\n\nwas to introduce this very requirement of\n\nobjective, that objective evidence of causation\n\nis something that makes it very difficult for\n\nplaintiff to be able to meet that standard.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"28","file_name":"Gonzalez v.

The\n\nCourt need only address that discrete question\n\nand it should hold that the exception can be\n\nsatisfied by various types of evidence that\n\nsupport the ultimate inference Nieves required,\n\nthat similarly situated persons who did not\n\nengage in First Amendment activity would not\n\nhave been arrested.\n\nRegardless of its form, evidence that\n\nsupports that inference does what Nieves\n\nrequires.  It addresses Hartman\u0027s causal concern\n\nby helping to establish that non-retaliatory\n\ngrounds were, in fact, insufficient to provoke\n\nthe adverse consequences.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"29","file_name":"Gonzalez v.

REAVES: So I think, just stepping\n\nback a little bit, I think it would be\n\nirregular, in light of the rationales this Court\n\nhas identified, to carve off the three sets of\n\nclaims in different ways that I think are at\n\nissue here.\n\nSo, first, there\u0027s retaliatory\n\nprosecution.  The general no probable cause bar\n\napplies.  There\u0027s also a split-second arrest.\n\nPetitioner agrees the general no probable cause\n\nrule applies there.\n\nIn the middle, the Court would look to\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n44\n\nOfficial\n\na different analogy, and I don\u0027t think that\n\nanalogy is justified by the rationales this\n\nCourt has articulated for the no probable cause\n\nrule, which are that probable cause will always\n\nbe relevant and readily available and evidence\n\nof it or lack thereof, and, second, that there\n\nmay be causal difficulties caused by multiple\n\nactors or the propriety of considering speech in\n\ncertain situations.\n\nAnd this category of more deliberative\n\narrests that Petitioner is carving out isn\u0027t\n\ndifferent on those kind of key issues that\n\nmotivated the exception.

REAVES: So that evidence,\n\nstanding alone, is not going to be enough to\n\ndemonstrate that there were similarly situated\n\npeople who engaged in the same sort of activity\n\nwho were not arrested.\n\nSo I think that evidence could\n\npotentially be relevant if there are other\n\nreasons to infer that there were, in fact,\n\nsimilarly situated people and they were not\n\narrested, but the novelty of a crime alone is\n\nnot enough to make the similarly situated\n\nshowing.\n\nI think there are a lot of good\n\nreasons for that.  We articulate some in our\n\nbrief, but that includes the fact that just\n\nbecause someone figures out a new way to engage\n\nin criminal activity doesn\u0027t suggest there\u0027s\n\nanything nefarious by a government prosecuting\n\nthat.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\n\nSotomayor?\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I\u0027m\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"40","file_name":"Gonzalez v.
