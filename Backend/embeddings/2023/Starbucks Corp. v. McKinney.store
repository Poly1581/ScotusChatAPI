I understood my\n\nfriend to further concede that point in her\n\nargument this morning.\n\nSecond, on harm, the question is not\n\nwhether there is a certainty of harm.  The\n\nquestion is whether there\u0027s a likelihood of\n\nharm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n34\n\nOfficial\n\nreasonably necessary.  That\u0027s the Ahearn case.\n\nWe think that\u0027s fully consistent with this\n\nCourt\u0027s precedents.\n\nAnd as to whether all discharges\n\ncount, we agree that not all unlawful discharges\n\nnecessarily show irreparable harm.  The question\n\nthat the Board looks at and the question that we\n\nthink the Court should look at is whether that\n\nextinguishes the momentum of the union drive or\n\nimpairs it in such a serious way that an order\n\nfrom the Board a year or two down the road won\u0027t\n\nbe able to restart the drive.\n\nSecond, on public interest and the\n\nequities, our basic point here is that when\n\nCongress makes a judgment about what is in the\n\npublic interest, the court cannot override that\n\njudgment in weighing the equities at that stage.\n\nThis is the Oakland Cannabis case.  The Court\n\nsays, if Congress has made a judgment that\n\nsomething is unlawful, you can\u0027t basically make\n\nthat thing lawful at the equities stage by\n\nrefusing to enforce Congress\u0027s judgment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"30","file_name":"Starbucks Corp. v.

We think that the\n\nCourt should take into account all relevant\n\ncontext. One piece of context is the statistics\n\nthat Justice Jackson mentioned.  The Board\n\nreceives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year.\n\nIt issues 750 complaints.  Last year, it\n\nauthorized 14 petitions and filed seven.

RAYNOR: I think the reason is\n\nthat in 1932, when it passed the\n\nNorris-LaGuardia Act, it imposed very stringent\n\nrestrictions on district court ability to issue\n\ninjunctions.  And in the post-war period, there\n\nwas essentially a lot of labor unrest that\n\ncourts weren\u0027t able to step in expeditiously and\n\nstop. And the court thought that was necessary.\n\nAnd so, if you look at the legislative history,\n\nCongress says, look, it sometimes takes the\n\nBoard a while to rule and there might be a lot\n\nof harm inflicted in the meantime, so we need to\n\ngive district courts the authority to prevent\n\nthat harm while Board proceedings are ongoing.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  It\u0027s certainly true,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n56\n\nOfficial\n\nthough, that Congress was not eager to\n\nresuscitate the labor injunction and Debs,\n\nright?\n\nMR.
