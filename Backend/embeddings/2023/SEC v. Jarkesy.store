history,\n\nCongress has authorized the agencies charged\n\nwith enforcing federal statutes to conduct\n\nadjudications, find facts, and impose civil\n\npenalties and other consequences prescribed by\n\nlaw. More than a century ago, this Court\n\ndescribed the validity of those statutes as\n\nsettled beyond any possible constitutional\n\nquestion, and since the enactment of the APA,\n\nthose and other administrative adjudications\n\nhave often been conducted by officers specially\n\nappointed for the purpose and removable only for\n\ncause.\n\nThis Court should reject all three of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nthe Fifth Circuit\u0027s reasons for upsetting that\n\nlongstanding and entrenched practice.\n\nFirst, this Court\u0027s decision in Atlas\n\nRoofing considered many of the same arguments\n\npresented today and reaffirmed that Congress\n\ndoes not violate the Seventh Amendment when it\n\nauthorizes an agency to impose civil penalties\n\nin administrative proceedings to enforce a\n\nfederal statute.  Respondents have not asked\n\nthis Court to overrule Atlas or the long line of\n\nprecedents on which it rested, and they also\n\nhaven\u0027t identified any relevant distinction\n\nbetween that case and this one.\n\nSecond, Congress does not violate the\n\nnondelegation doctrine when it gives an agency\n\nthe choice of pursuing administrative or","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"SEC v.

Because,\n\nyou know, Jarkesy\u0027s not disputing that you can\n\nget those kinds of things in administrative\n\nproceedings.  So why civil penalties too?\n\nMR.

FLETCHER:  He is focused on civil\n\npenalties, but disgorgement also affects the\n\nprivate right to property.  And so some of his\n\narguments, I think the implication of them is\n\nthose things also couldn\u0027t happen in\n\nadministrative proceedings.  I\u0027m a little\n\nunclear about that because the argument moves\n\nback and forth from Article III to the Seventh\n\nAmendment, but I think the potential\n\nimplications of cutting back on the Atlas\n\nRoofing understanding of public rights doesn\u0027t\n\njust apply to penalties.  It\u0027s also cases\n\ninvolving disgorgement or other such remedies.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"75","file_name":"SEC v.

FLETCHER:  So, again, if -- if you\n\n-- there\u0027s a couple ways that you could depart\n\nfrom Atlas Roofing. One would be to say we\u0027re\n\ndecoupling the Seventh Amendment from the\n\nArticle III inquiry, and we\u0027re going to\n\nrecognize a new class of suits where Article III\n\nwould let you give it to an agency, but the\n\nSeventh Amendment still requires a trial by\n\njury. There, I think such a rule might be\n\nlimited to civil penalties because the other\n\nremedies are equitable.\n\nBut, if you go in the other direction,\n\nwhich some of my friends have suggested and some\n\nof the questions have suggested, and say anytime\n\nyou have an administrative action that affects\n\nprivate property or liberty or anything else,\n\nthat\u0027s public rights, that means that under\n\nArticle III it can\u0027t go to the agency to begin\n\nwith.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah, I agree with\n\nyou there.

 So I agree that\n\nAtlas Roofing resolves this case, but like many\n\nof my colleagues, I guess I don\u0027t understand\n\nyour reading of Atlas Roofing as suggesting\n\nthere\u0027s no Seventh Amendment issue at all if the\n\nfact-finding function is assigned to the agency.\n\nI mean, the case begins, sentence one,\n\nthe issue in this case -- in -- in these cases\n\nis whether, consistent with the Seventh\n\nAmendment, Congress may create a new cause of\n\naction in the government for civil penalties\n\nenforceable in an administrative agency where\n\nthere is no jury trial.\n\nYou seem to say, well, it depends on\n\nwhether Congress has assigned resolution of this\n\nto the agency.  But that seems totally\n\nconclusory and circular to me. And I think the\n\nquestion is, when does the Seventh Amendment\n\nprohibit Congress from assigning it to the\n\nagency as opposed to giving it to an Article III\n\ncourt?\n\nYou say that\u0027s forum-dependent, but --\n\nbut the -- the question is, when can they give\n\nit to one forum versus the other?

I\u0027d like to say just a quick word\n\nabout removal and then talk about the Seventh\n\nAmendment issue.\n\nSo, on removal, I just want to take it\n\nat a 30,000-foot level.  I think the lesson from\n\nthis Court\u0027s cases is -- is that removal is\n\nabout accountability and control.\n\nAnd in Free Enterprise Fund, there was\n\na real concern that the president regulated\n\nparties and the public wouldn\u0027t know whether or\n\nnot the Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nactually supported the enforcement and policy\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"137","file_name":"SEC v.

The\n\nstatute at issue there said, and I quote, \"that\n\nemployees had a right to be at a workplace free\n\nfrom recognized hazards that were likely to\n\ncause serious injury or death.\"\n\nWhat had happened was that one\n\nemployer failed to shore up a trench and it\n\ncollapsed and an employee died, and another\n\nemployee fell through an open roof and died.\n\nThose things could have been the basis\n\nfor wrongful death or negligence actions\n\nevaluated under very similar standards, and yet\n\nthe Court had no problem saying that they were\n\nvalidly enforced through administrative\n\nproceedings because Congress had created a\n\nfederal statutory scheme.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nOfficial\n\n154\n\nIt has done the same thing here.

the clearest indication of that is this\n\nCourt\u0027s decision in Kokesh, which explained why\n\nthe remedies that the SEC gets, even when they\n\nare monetary or compensatory, are not

They are remedies for a public\n\nwrong and they are therefore properly considered\n\npenalties.  I think, for much the same reason,\n\nthis is not the case where you have a concern\n\nabout circumvention of the common law rights.\n\nI think the other thing that I would\n\nsay is that he has tried to convince you that\n\nyou\u0027ve overruled Atlas Roofing already in\n\nGranfinanciera, but the parts of the opinion\n\nthat he is talking about and, with respect,\n\nJustice Gorsuch, that you have quoted are about\n\nsuits between private parties.\n\nWhen you talk about suits involving\n\nthe government, Granfinanciera is explicit.

They\u0027ve made arguments based on\n\nhistory.\n\nBut they haven\u0027t taken on the burden\n\nthat we expect parties to take on when they ask\n\nus to overrule precedent.  They haven\u0027t\n\nacknowledged what they\u0027re asking for.  They\n\nhaven\u0027t grappled with practice and principle,\n\nand so whatever those arguments might be in a\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n157\n\nOfficial\n\nfuture case, we\u0027re not going to engage with them\n\nhere.\n\nI think you should do the same thing\n\ntoday.
