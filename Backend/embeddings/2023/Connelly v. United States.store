SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nTo ensure continuity in their\n\noperations, closely held corporations will often\n\nagree to redeem the stock of a shareholder upon\n\nhis death and then obtain a life insurance\n\npolicy on the shareholder in order to fund the\n\nredemption obligation.\n\nThis case presents the question of how\n\nthe federal estate tax treats such arrangements.\n\nBecause the proceeds from a life insurance\n\npolicy to fulfill a contractual redemption\n\nobligation do not increase the corporation\u0027s net\n\nworth, they do not increase the estate tax owed\n\non the decedent\u0027s stock.

The\n\nInternal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations\n\nprovide that where the parties agree on the\n\nprice to redeem a shareholder\u0027s stock, that\n\nprice will establish the value of the stock for\n\npurposes of the estate tax in certain\n\ncircumstances.\n\nBut where, as here, those\n\ncircumstances have not been met, the value of\n\nthe stock is determined by the price at which\n\nsuch stock would change hands between a\n\nhypothetical willing buyer and willing seller.\n\nHere, a hypothetical buyer would not\n\ntreat the life insurance proceeds as increasing\n\nthe value of the stock because that asset is","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Connelly v.

 So, with respect,\n\nJustice Kagan, I completely disagree with that,\n\nand let me explain why.\n\nIt is true that Thomas is in a very\n\nreal sense practically the beneficiary of the\n\nlife insurance proceeds.  Why?  Because those\n\nproceeds extinguish the offsetting liability on\n\nthe books, the offsetting redemption obligation.\n\nAnd so this is a context in which\n\nThomas does come away with the benefit of those\n\nproceeds because he is the sole owner of a\n\ncompany that is worth $3.86 million.\n\nNow the government complains around\n\nthe edges about the fact that it\u0027s the capital\n\ngains tax, the capital gains tax only operates\n\nupon realization, there is a stepped-up basis\n\nwhen someone dies and passes the stock along and\n\nso forth.\n\nBut those are all features of the\n\ncapital gains tax system. That is not a bug\n\nwith our position.  Again, our position is the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n12\n\nOfficial\n\nrational one precisely because the tax system\n\ncaptures that increase.\n\nAnd, of course, under our approach,\n\nMichael\u0027s heir is still, of course, paying the\n\nestate tax. Michael\u0027s heir is paying the estate\n\ntax at -- on stock at around $3 million,\n\ncoincidentally roughly the amount that was\n\ncontained in the buy-sell agreement, which I\n\nthink confirms that that amount was a rational\n\namount here.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"9","file_name":"Connelly v.

 I think that that\u0027s a\n\nfair factual statement, but let me explain to\n\nyou why that should make no difference.\n\nIn our view, the -- the redemption\n\nobligation is like any other debt from the\n\nperspective of the hypothetical buyer.  And I\n\nrecognize that this is the artificiality of the\n\ncase, but I think it\u0027s an artificiality of the\n\ncase that is inherent in the way that the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\nregulations work, and I think it\u0027s a problem\n\nthat the government has to come to terms with as\n\nwell.\n\nOur view is that from the perspective\n\nof a hypothetical third party, the fact that\n\nthis redemption obligation runs to somebody else\n\nis of no moment. The hypothetical buyer here is\n\nnot in the same position as Michael. It\u0027s a\n\nhypothetical buyer.\n\nAnd so that is why we think that when\n\nyou\u0027re applying a regulation that requires you\n\nto take into account all relevant facts, you\u0027ve\n\ngot to look at the economic reality from the\n\nposition of the company.\n\nAnd, again, the best way I think to\n\nunderstand that is to think about whether or not\n\nthe government\u0027s fair market valuation would be\n\none that the parties would use. We know that\n\nour fair market valuation, in fact, pretty\n\nclosely tracks the price that was agreed.

Why? Precisely because the\n\ncompany has to use other assets and typically\n\noperating assets in order to fund the redemption\n\nobligation.\n\nAnd in that circumstance, there could\n\nwell be a depressive effect on the valuation,\n\nand that depressive effect could, in fact, be\n\nsubstantial. One reason why this circumstance\n\nis different is precisely because, where you\n\nhave an offsetting life insurance policy and\n\nredemption obligation, it actually makes sense\n\nto think about valuation in terms of the net\n\nworth of the company.\n\nI think, once you start to get away\n\nfrom that, the valuation of the company is\n\naffected by its remaining operating assets, how\n\nthe business is going to do on a going-forward\n\nbasis.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThe estate\u0027s evaluation of Michael\n\nConnelly\u0027s shares contradicts basic math and\n\nvaluation principles.  According to the estate,\n\nbefore we can value Michael\u0027s shares in Crown,\n\nwe must first subtract the price that Crown paid\n\nfor Michael\u0027s shares.  In other words, the\n\nestate\u0027s theory is that before you can value\n\nsomething, you must first subtract the price\n\npaid for the very thing you are trying to value.\n\nThat makes no sense.  Using the item\n\nyou\u0027re trying to value as a line item in its own\n\nvaluation will never give you the correct\n\nanswer, and it doesn\u0027t give the estate the right\n\nanswer here either.\n\nThe estate\u0027s contrary view rests on a\n\nfundamental misunderstanding of the nature of a\n\nredemption obligation.  A redemption obligation\n\nis not a corporate debt that reduces the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n32\n\nOfficial\n\ncorporation\u0027s net worth or the value of the\n\nshares to be redeemed.  A debt owed to creditors\n\nreduces corporate and shareholder value.  A\n\nredemption obligation divides the corporate pie\n\namong existing shareholders without changing the\n\nvalue of their interests.\n\nAnd, here, the corporate pie was worth\n\n6.86 million, not 3.86 million.  And that\u0027s true\n\neven if you look only at the estate\u0027s own\n\nnumbers.

that\u0027s the fundamental problem\n\nwith the government\u0027s position.\n\nYou see, the government doesn\u0027t\n\ndispute the fact that it is a liability in\n\ncommon sense or accounting terms.

But the problem here is\n\nthat we\u0027re analyzing this from the perspective\n\nof a hypothetical buyer, not Michael.\n\nAnd from the perspective of a\n\nhypothetical buyer, this is, therefore, like any\n\nother debt.

I would respectfully submit that\n\nthe number of client alerts and -- and the\n\namount of froth in the industry in response to\n\nthe Court\u0027s grant of cert suggests that this is\n\na pretty common practice.\n\nBut, if we look at the reported cases,\n\nI think the two critical facts are, first, that\n\nthe government, in fact, took the contrary\n\nposition in Estate of Cartwright, a case where\n\nthe contrary position benefitted the government\n\nbecause we were dealing with income tax rather\n\nthan the estate tax; second, that the government\n\nnever indicated its non-acquiescence in those\n\ndecisions as the IRS sometimes does when it\n\ndisagrees with them; and, third, that I think\n\nit\u0027s a little bit unfair to disparage the Ninth\n\nand the Eleventh Circuits here because it isn\u0027t\n\nas if the Eighth Circuit offered more extended\n\nreasoning.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"55","file_name":"Connelly v.
