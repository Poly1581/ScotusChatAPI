TSEYTLIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIn Section 3311 of the Post-9/11 GI\n\nBill, Congress awarded veterans who served after\n\nthe September 11th attacks with an entitlement\n\nto wartime benefits befitting their wartime\n\nservice.  In Section 3327 of the same Act,\n\nCongress created a generous benefits\n\ncoordination regime wherein veterans who had\n\nearned peacetime Montgomery veteran -- benefits\n\nwith post-9/11 service could trade the unused\n\nportion of those Montgomery benefits for\n\nPost-9/11 benefits.\n\nMy client has no interest in trading\n\nhis Montgomery benefits for his Post-9/11\n\nbenefits, so he has no use for the three -- 3327\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nelection regime.

So he\u0027s\n\nentitled to both Montgomery and -- and\n\nPost-9/11.\n\nYou say but he has to choose, as\n\nthough he\u0027s not allowed to cash in or take\n\nadvantage of both.  So, first of all, is -- is\n\nthat reading coming from 3322(a) as you\u0027ve said?\n\nMR. SURI: Yes.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  But I\n\ndidn\u0027t hear you necessarily to read the entire\n\nsection, which seems to me to cast a different\n\nlight.

Congress may have decided\n\nthat if you\u0027ve used your 36 months of Post-9/11\n\nbenefits to go to college, you don\u0027t need\n\nadditional benefits under the program that\u0027s\n\ngeared toward vocational training.  But, if you\n\nused your 36 months of benefits under the\n\nvocational program, then you might still want to\n\ngo to college for a few years and, therefore,\n\nwe\u0027ll leave open the option of getting the\n\nPost-9/11 college-related benefits.\n\nA third possibility is that Congress\n\nsaid: We\u0027re going to be extremely generous for\n\nthose who want 36 months of benefits, you\u0027ll\n\nhave this extremely helpful Post-9/11 program,\n\nbut for those who want more than 36 months,","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"54","file_name":"Rudisill v.

Second, I\n\nthink you had been asked about the other side\u0027s\n\npoint that 3327 is best read as a swap or\n\ntrade-in provision, and you said you appreciated\n\nthe opportunity to answer the question, but I\n\ndon\u0027t think you were able to get the answer.

The first answer is the textual\n\npoint, which is 3327(a) says an individual may\n\nelect to receive educational assistance under\n\nthis chapter. That echoes the language of\n\n3322(a), which says \"shall elect\" under which\n\nchapter to receive educational assistance.\n\nThat\u0027s a clue that this provision is\n\none of the options that is on the table under\n\n3322(a).  3322(a) is saying you must pick either\n\nChapter 30, Montgomery, or Chapter 33,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"66","file_name":"Rudisill v.
