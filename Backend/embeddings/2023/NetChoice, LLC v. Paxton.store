This, you know, the --\n\nand -- and in a sense, the European Union\n\nprovision has sort of a built-in kind of, you\n\nknow, reasonably practical provision right into\n\nwhat you have to do. You only have to do what\u0027s\n\nreasonably practical.\n\nThis is an absolute requirement to\n\nrespond to every -- you know, every takedown,\n\nand that\u0027s over a billion takedowns of comments\n\nin a quarter for YouTube.

want to pick up with the question\n\nthat Justice Alito asked in the seriatim round\n\nto my friend about the idea that the social\n\nmedia platforms don\u0027t perfectly fit into either\n\nanalogy or paradigm here, and I want to\n\nacknowledge the force of that intuition.\n\nThey obviously operate at a massive\n\nscale that goes beyond any particular parade or\n\nbeyond any particular newspaper. I think the\n\nright thing to do with that intuition is to\n\nrecognize that it\u0027s not like you can just exempt\n\nthem from the First Amendment.\n\nThey are obviously creating something\n\nthat\u0027s inherently expressive in taking all of\n\nthis quantity of speech on their websites and\n\ncurating it and making selectivity decisions and\n\ncompiling it into a product that users are going\n\nto consume.\n\nSo the First Amendment applies, but I\n\nthink that those kinds of concerns about how the\n\nsocial media platforms and how they look\n\nsomewhat different from the other kinds of\n\nexpressive products this Court has reviewed in\n\nprior cases can come in to the question of\n\nwhether the First Amendment is satisfied with\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial\n\nrespect to any particular regulation.\n\nNow, here, we think it\u0027s not satisfied\n\nbecause of the way that Texas has designed this\n\nlaw. I\u0027d urge the Court to rule narrowly.  It\u0027s\n\nnot necessary here to try to figure out how the\n\nFirst Amendment applies to new technology in","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"34","file_name":"NetChoice, LLC v.

This law has a very\n\nclear defect.\n\nWhat Texas has done is tried to\n\ncountermand the protected editorial speech\n\ndecisions of the platform and the only\n\njustification it\u0027s offered to the courts below\n\nis that it wanted to essentially amplify the\n\nvoice of users on that platform by suppressing\n\nthe platform\u0027s own protected speech.  That is a\n\ndefect that is clear under the First Amendment,\n\nand the Court could say only that and resolve\n\nthis case.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  General, the -- when\n\nI asked you about the differential -- the\n\ndifference in treatment of a private party as\n\nopposed to the government engaged in similar\n\nconduct, your answer was, of course, that it\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\nwould -- it would be different, the government\n\nwould be bound to comply with the First\n\nAmendment.\n\nWhat -- there was some discussion in a\n\nnumber of the amicus briefs about instances in\n\nwhich the government and the private party, say,\n\nPetitioners or -- Petitioners here, and the\n\ngovernment coordinating efforts.\n\nHow would you respond to that?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  So let me respond","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"35","file_name":"NetChoice, LLC v.

could be deemed a state actor and\n\nthat would be subject to First Amendment\n\nscrutiny.\n\nWe vigorously dispute that that has\n\nactually happened and the federal government has\n\nengaged in that

square to\n\nspeak of.\n\nWe know this because Twitter has\n\nadmitted that their theory of the First\n\nAmendment would allow them to discriminate not\n\njust based on what is said on the platform but\n\n\"on the basis of religion or gender or physical\n\ndisability.\"\n\nThat\u0027s not the First Amendment.\n\nThat\u0027s Lochner 2.0.

NIELSON: So I give you my theory\n\nfor why common carriage is important here.  As I\n\nlook at the cases, and I agree, they\u0027re really\n\nhard to figure out where conduct starts and\n\nspeech ends and all of that, and you look at all\n\nthe various cases this Court has said, some\n\ncommentators say they can\u0027t be reconciled.  I\u0027m\n\nnot sure about that.\n\nBut I think as a helpful way to think\n\nabout it is we know that there is a line between\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n55\n\nOfficial\n\nspeech and conduct, and we know that common\n\ncarriage has always been on the non-speech side\n\nof the line, the conduct side of the line.  So,\n\nif this falls within the common law tradition of\n\nwhat is common carriage, nobody has ever thought\n\nthat falls on the speech side of the line.  So\n\nwe -- we can\u0027t make them, you know, say\n\nsomething otherwise that they -- that they\n\ndidn\u0027t want to say.\n\nThe whole point of it is that\u0027s a\n\nsignal to the Court, that\u0027s a way that the Court\n\ncan figure out which side of the line are we on.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that\u0027s --","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"49","file_name":"NetChoice, LLC v.
