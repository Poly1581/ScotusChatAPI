Congress created\n\ntwo distinct forms of notice, and it made both\n\nof them potential grounds for in absentia\n\nremoval.\n\nThe removal orders in these cases were\n\nbased on notices of hearing that specified a new\n\ntime and place for the removal proceedings and\n\nthat warned the non-citizens of the consequences\n\nof failing to attend those proceedings.

McCLOUD: Certainly, Your Honor.\n\nSo I think that the important thing about\n\nPereira is that it was a narrow decision that\n\ndecided a particular question presented, and\n\nthat question presented was about the\n\ninteraction between the stop-time rule in\n\n1229b(d)(1) and the notice to appear\n\nrequirements.\n\nAnd if I could point to where in the\n\nCourt\u0027s opinion that holding appears, it\u0027s at\n\nthe beginning of Part II B of the opinion.  This\n\nis on page 2114 of the Supreme Court Reporter\n\nversion if you have that available.\n\nAnd at the beginning of the first\n\nparagraph of that section of the opinion, the\n\nCourt says, \"The statutory text alone is enough\n\nto resolve this case.\"  It then proceeds to\n\nanalyze the text of the two provisions that I\n\njust referenced.\n\nNow it\u0027s true that after this point in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n7\n\nOfficial\n\nthe opinion, there is additional analysis, but I","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"4","file_name":"Campos-Chaves v.

I mean, the\n\nthing that\u0027s a little concerning to me about the\n\nway the government has constructed its argument\n\nhere is the suggestion that we ignore\n\n1229(a)(5)(A), which requires the government to\n\ngive the person notice as a prerequisite for the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\ngovernment\u0027s ability to take advantage of the\n\nprocedure of removing them without a hearing.\n\nSo I guess I\u0027m a little concerned that\n\nwhat you\u0027re suggesting is that we should presume\n\nthat the -- that the removal is proper, the\n\nremoval order is proper, even if the notice was\n\ndefective, and now it\u0027s on the non-citizen to\n\nsay something or it shifts to his burden to\n\nprove, you know, that he should not be removed\n\nunder those circumstances.\n\nMR. McCLOUD: A -- a couple of\n\nresponses, Your Honor.\n\nFirst, we are not asking you to read\n\nout of the statute the -- the paragraph (2)\n\nnotice or to ignore the paragraph (1) notice.\n\nWe\u0027re saying both of those notices are relevant","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"27","file_name":"Campos-Chaves v.

Like, what will\n\nhappen to those hundreds of thousands of cases?\n\nMR. McCLOUD: Certainly, Justice\n\nKavanaugh.  So, as the Ninth Circuit has\n\ninterpreted this provision, all of those\n\nhundreds of thousands of individuals have a\n\nright to seek rescission.  And as I was\n\ndiscussing with some members of the Court\n\nearlier, at least in the Ninth Circuit and some\n\nother courts, that right is essentially\n\nautomatic.\n\nAnd so we are very concerned that\n\nthose hundreds of thousands of cases could be\n\ninjected back into the immigration system.  And\n\nwe have already seen some evidence of that in\n\nthe wake of the Ninth Circuit\u0027s panel decision\n\nin Singh.  So, in 2021, the year prior to the\n\nSingh panel decision, there were 380 motions to\n\nrescind in absentia orders filed nationwide.

So a big\n\nconcern and I think the -- the worst part for\n\nyou is this blank document hypothetical or\n\nhypothetical that omits crucial information like\n\nthe right to counsel or the grounds for removal.\n\nWhat would the IJ do -- and -- and I\u0027m\n\ngoing to toe -- the Justice Gorsuch line here --\n\ndon\u0027t refer me to the regulations.  As a matter\n\nof the statutory language, for purposes of\n\ndetermining whether the non-citizen by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence is removable, is it possible\n\nif only the notice of hearing has been provided\n\nfor the IJ to make that determination?\n\nI mean, I guess, according to the\n\nstatute, the government could simply say and\n\nlaunch into a whole new explanation that wasn\u0027t\n\nincluded in any NTA about why the alien or the\n\nnon-citizen is removable.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"42","file_name":"Campos-Chaves v.

the government\u0027s argument here.\n\nIndeed, the government\u0027s position in\n\nthese cases is more extreme than its position in\n\nNiz-Chavez.

The reason that\n\nCongress put in the \"at any time\" hook is\n\nbecause they imagined these would be one-off\n\ncircumstances where something gets lost in the\n\nmail or the government makes a typo and so\n\nswitches two non-citizens\u0027 paperwork.\n\nThey were not imagining sort of\n\nsystematically ignoring the statute for many\n\nyears.

this\n\npoint and I -- I take that point and I think\n\nthat\u0027s right, but I wonder whether or not\n\nCongress actually is solving for that problem in\n\na different way than the government is\n\nsuggesting here, right?\n\nI -- the way I read this statutory\n\nscheme, Congress is allowing people who don\u0027t\n\nshow up and who have an order issued against\n\nthem in absentia to actually move to rescind\n\nHeritage Reporting

is saying:  Well, what\n\nabout all the gamesmanship of the person not\n\nshowing up?\n\nI think Congress says, if you\u0027re going\n\nto remove -- excuse me -- if you\u0027re going to\n\nrescind, the burden is on you to show you never\n\ngot the notice or that the notice was defective,\n\nyou say, in this situation.  The burden shifts\n\nto the person to get the order rescinded, and\n\nthat\u0027s the way the Congress is solving for\n\npeople gaming the system.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"104","file_name":"Campos-Chaves v.

to Pereira, it is true that there\n\nare cases in this Court where the Court\n\nconstrues one statutory provision and that\n\ndecision has the effect of resolving other\n\nstatutory questions.  Pereira is not that case.\n\nAnd it would be very strange to pre -- to treat\n\nPereira as such a case when Pereira went out of\n\nits way to say that its holding was narrow and\n\nwas confined to particular statutory provisions\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n116\n\nOfficial\n\nthat are not at issue in this case.  So we don\u0027t\n\nthink that Pereira resolves these cases, nor\n\ndoes Niz-Chavez.\n\nFinally, as to the consequences, the\n\nconsequences here are not just the number of\n\nmotions to rescind that might be filed.  The\n\nlarger problem is that the other side\u0027s\n\ninterpretation of these provisions deprives them\n\nof any sort of rational force. There\u0027s no\n\nreason that Congress would have enacted the\n\nversion of the provision that Ms. Anand just\n\ndescribed, and I don\u0027t think you need to look\n\nany further than the facts of these cases to see\n\nthat.\n\nIn these cases, the non-citizens got\n\nevery single piece of information that they were\n\nrequired to get not just under paragraph (2) but\n\nalso under paragraph (1).  They knew the\n\ncharges, they knew the nature of the\n\nproceedings, and they knew that they had the\n\nright to counsel.
