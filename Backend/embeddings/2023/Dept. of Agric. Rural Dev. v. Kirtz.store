Snyder.\n\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN W.\n\nSNYDER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\nMR.\n\nSNYDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThe question in this case is whether\n\nCongress unambiguously waived the sovereign\n\nimmunity of the United States when it amended\n\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to provide\n\nthat any person who violates FCRA\u0027s requirements\n\nis liable for money damages.\n\nThe answer to that question is no.  To\n\nstart, there\u0027s no basis for claiming that\n\nCongress has expressly waived sovereign\n\nimmunity.  For all of Respondent\u0027s emphasis on\n\nfollowing the literal text of the statute, he\n\nultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA\n\naddresses sovereign immunity directly.\n\nInstead, Respondent is asking this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nCourt to read an unwritten waiver into the\n\nstatute on the theory that every time Congress\n\ncreates a cause of action that applies to both\n\nsovereign and non-sovereign defendants, it must\n\nimplicitly intend to eliminate sovereign\n\nimmunity.\n\nBut that argument is wrong for two\n\nreasons.  First, it\u0027s fundamentally inconsistent\n\nwith the nature of sovereign immunity.\n\nSovereign immunity is a defense that, by\n\ndefinition, has effect only when there is a\n\ncause of action that would otherwise impose\n\nliability.  So, if every cause of action that\n\ncovers a sovereign also waived that sovereign\u0027s\n\nimmunity, the defense would never matter.

You can see why Congress\n\ndidn\u0027t want to say that every time Congress\n\nmeant to refer to a lot of different entities.\n\nSo -- but, you know, it\u0027s statutory\n\ninterpretation 101 that we take a defined term,\n\nwe plug the definition in, and that\u0027s what the\n\nmeaning of the statute is.

So last term, in Lac du\n\nFlambeau, for example, there was an express\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity that made\n\nabsolutely clear that what Congress was\n\nintending to do was waive sovereign immunity,\n\nand it did so on behalf of governmental units\n\nand then defined governmental units elsewhere in\n\nthe statute.  And this sort of subbing in the --\n\nthe words from the definition -- definition into\n\nthe waiver of sovereign immunity would have\n\nworked perfectly there because all you were\n\nasking was what do the words that Congress used\n\nmean.\n\nBut, here, you\u0027re not asking just what\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n10\n\nOfficial\n\ndo the words mean; you\u0027re asking about the --\n\nthe necessary logical implication of what\n\nCongress has done.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"7","file_name":"Dept. of Agric.

this one developed.\n\nBut the other side basically says\n\ndon\u0027t pay attention to Employees, and I think\n\nJustice Sotomayor alluded to that, because it\u0027s\n\nold, a 1973 case.  So I want your response to\n\nthat.\n\nMR. SNYDER: So, I mean, first, we\n\ndon\u0027t think this is how this Court treats\n\nprecedents.  Again, as I said, we think that\n\nthis Court has reaffirmed Employees and -- and\n\nrecognized that Employees began the retreat from\n\nParden, but even just looking at the text of\n\nEmployees, I think it\u0027s consistent with the\n\nargument and the distinctions that I\u0027m drawing\n\ntoday.\n\nThe Court there said that the cause of\n\naction by its literal terms covered state\n\nagencies, but it recognized that the relevant\n\nquestion was whether Congress had intend --\n\nintended to bring the states to heel by lifting\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\ntheir immunity.  So it recognized that was a\n\ndistinct question, and then it said Congress\n\nwouldn\u0027t have done that silently.\n\nAnd, in particular, it said that if\n\nCongress had intended to do that, it would have\n\ndone one of two things.  It -- it either would\n\nhave addressed immunity expressly, or it would\n\nhave amended the cause of action, and in that\n\ncontext, what that would have meant was adding a\n\nspecific reference to state agencies to the\n\ncause of action.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"34","file_name":"Dept. of Agric.

were talking about what Congress\u0027s intent\n\nwas, isn\u0027t it strange that Congress amended it\n\nand didn\u0027t amend the liability provision.

SNYDER: So I -- I think, if you\n\nwant to look at that timing, I think the timing\n\nactually cuts the other way because, in\n\nEmploy -- in Employees, what Congress was doing\n\nwas taking a statute that already authorized\n\ncivil liability against -- against employers and\n\nsaying we want state agencies to be employers\n\nfor purposes of this statute.  We\u0027re going to --\n\nwe\u0027re going to cover them under the same\n\ndefinition that until now has covered all\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n48\n\nOfficial\n\nemployers.\n\nAnd so, in that circumstance, it might\n\nhave been reasonable to think that Congress\n\nintended state agencies to be covered in exactly\n\nthe same way as all other employers because\n\nCongress was specifically focused on state\n\nagencies.  And yet --\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, but it wasn\u0027t\n\nfocused on liability for this purpose. That\u0027s\n\nmy only point.  Can I ask you another question?\n\nI guess I hear you suggesting that\n\nthere has to be an express mention of the\n\n\"federal government\" in the provision.
