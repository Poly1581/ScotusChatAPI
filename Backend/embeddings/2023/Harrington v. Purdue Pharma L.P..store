(b)(3)(A), which is\n\nparticularly important here, talks about the\n\nsettlement of claims or interests belonging to\n\nthe debtor or to the estate.

But this is contingent on the guilty\n\nplea, which is contingent on the -- on the\n\nconfirmation of the plan.\n\nAnd so Purdue, if the plan doesn\u0027t get\n\nconfirmed, doesn\u0027t need to go through with the\n\nguilty plea.

GANNON: We\u0027ve -- we\u0027ve raised the\n\nSeventh Amendment as a statutory argument in\n\nlight of the provision of Title 28 that says\n\nnothing in the Bankruptcy Code will derogate\n\nfrom that in the context of wrongful death and\n\npersonal injury claims.  So we do think that\n\nthat\u0027s a significant issue here.\n\nAnd it\u0027s notable that this plan\n\naccounts for Seventh Amendment rights for people\n\nwho have claims against Purdue but not for those\n\nwho have claims against the Sacklers.

case illustrates how\n\nthird-party releases can and do directly advance\n\nthe core objectives of bankruptcy in appropriate\n\nand appropriately limited circumstances.\n\nBecause of the inextricable\n\nrelationship between Purdue and the Sackler\n\ndirectors and officers of Purdue, victims have\n\nfiled identical claims against Purdue and the\n\nSacklers for the same injuries based on the same\n\nconduct.\n\nEveryone agrees that the claims\n\nagainst Purdue can be channeled to the creditor\n\n-- trusts.  The releases simply prevent\n\ncreditors  from jumping the line and depleting\n\nthe estate through the back door by suing the\n\nSacklers for the same injuries based on the same\n\nexact conduct involving Purdue.

So, as -- as to the\n\nindividual debtors, Your Honor, I think it\n\nunderscores the fundamental difference between\n\nthis reorganization proceeding and individual\n\ndebtor proceedings, that the discharge -- the\n\nexception from discharge for fraud apply to\n\nindividuals, not corporate reorganizations.  In\n\nthis case, everybody agrees that the many claims\n\nfor fraud against Purdue can be channeled to the\n\ntrusts.\n\nAnd because -- and this -- that\u0027s\n\nbecause, in this reorganization proceeding, the\n\nfocus is on maximizing the estate and equitably\n\ndistributing it to all of the victims.

SHAH\n\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF\n\nUNSECURED CREDITORS OF PURDUE PHARMA L.P., ET AL.\n\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\n\nit please the Court:\n\nThe U.S. Trustee does not speak for\n\nthe victims of the opioid crisis.  Quite the\n\nopposite, the Trustee appointed the official\n\ncommittee, my client, as the fiduciary\n\nrepresenting their interests.  Every one of the\n\ncreditor constituencies in this case comprising\n\nindividual victims and public entities harmed by\n\nPurdue overwhelmingly supports the plan.\n\nIndeed, it was the creditors that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n94\n\nOfficial\n\ninsisted on the release of the creditor claims\n\nagainst the Sacklers for the same injuries to\n\navoid a value-destroying victim-against-victim\n\nrace to the courthouse that would result in no\n\nrecovery for virtually all except the\n\nUnited States.\n\nThat unrebutted finding grounded in a\n\nmassive record built on years of creditor\n\nvictim-led efforts refutes the Trustee\u0027s\n\neleventh-hour speculation of some magic\n\nalternative permitting an equitable victim\n\nrecovery.\n\nThat is why the fact-finder relied on\n\nSection 1123(b)(6)\u0027s broad terms to approve the\n\ntailored release as essential to restructuring\n\nthe debtor-creditor relationship in this case on\n\nwhich lives literally depend.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"85","file_name":"Harrington v.

That is why 97 percent of the\n\nvictims agreed to this nonconsensual release.\n\nThey have no love lost for the Sacklers.\n\nThere is no body of victims, no one,\n\nwho would more like to have retribution against\n\nthe Sacklers.

If I could just make four points.\n\nFirst, Ms. Isaacs, Justice Kavanaugh,\n\nhas been objecting to this release since the\n\nbankruptcy court, and she filed claims, to quote\n\nfrom her question presented, \"on behalf of\n\nherself and her deceased son, whom she found\n\ndead from an overdose on her bathroom floor.\"\n\nAll of her claims have been released.  We think\n\nthat there is no doubt that she has standing\n\nhere. And this idea that she has to specify the\n\nconnection with this release is something that\n\nwe haven\u0027t heard from the other side before.\n\nSecond, Justice Sotomayor, that\u0027s not\n\na derivative claim.
