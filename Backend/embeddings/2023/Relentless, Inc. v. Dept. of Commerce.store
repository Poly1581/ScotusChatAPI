Article III empowers judges to\n\nsay what the law is. It requires them to\n\ninterpret federal statutes using their best and\n\nindependent judgment.\n\nChevron undermines that duty. It\n\nreallocates interpretive authority from courts\n\nto agencies, and it forces courts to adopt\n\ninferior agency constructions that are issued\n\nfor political or policy reasons. In doing so,\n\nChevron blocks judges from serving as faithful\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nagents of Congress.

The\n\nmost straightforward reading of Section 706\n\nrequires de novo review of legal questions.\n\nCongress put constitutional and statutory\n\ninterpretation on equal footing, and it required\n\nindependent legal judgment as to both.

JACKSON:  Mr. Martinez, what\n\n-- what I\u0027m stuck on is what seems to be an\n\nassumption in your argument that every question\n\nposed with respect to interpreting --\n\ninterpreting a statute is a legal one.\n\nI see Chevron as doing the very\n\nHeritage Reporting

won\u0027t have a problem of courts\n\nactually making a policy decision.\n\nSo Justice Kagan gave you a number of\n\nexamples, and I think the reason why those\n\nexamples are hard or why they\u0027re ambiguous or\n\nwhatever is because, at bottom, they\u0027re not\n\nasking legal questions; they\u0027re asking policy\n\nquestions.  How is it that, you know,\n\n\"stationary source\" is to be defined?  That\u0027s\n\nnot really a legal question.  I mean, there\n\ncould be several reasonable ways of interpreting\n\nthat.

at the end of the day, I think the\n\nway I\u0027ve been thinking about Chevron is Congress\n\nhas given that policy choice to the agency.\n\nAnd my concern is that if we take away\n\nsomething like Chevron, the court will then\n\nsuddenly become a policymaker, by majority rule\n\nor not, making policy determinations.

I mean, isn\u0027t Chevron, step one,\n\neven in this very case, asking the question,\n\none, has Congress made that policy\n\ndetermination?  So, for example, here, the\n\nquestion is whether or not monitors on the boats\n\nhave to be paid for by the owner of the boat.\n\nI see that as a policy question.\n\nCongress could have said yes or no.

Because I\u0027m just wondering\n\nwhether we could say that the definition of\n\ndietary supplement or drug might be something\n\nthat\u0027s a question of statutory interpretation in\n\nthe context of the statute, but which category\n\nany one thing fell in might be a question of\n\npolicy for the agency.\n\nMR.

PRELOGAR:  Section 706 says\n\nthat courts should decide all relevant questions\n\nof law and interpret statutes, but none of that\n\nis inconsistent with the Chevron framework\n\nbecause 706 doesn\u0027t prescribe a universal\n\nstandard of review to govern those kinds of\n\nstatutory interpretation questions.  And the\n\ncourts are interpreting statutes when they walk\n\nthrough the Chevron framework.\n\nFirst, there\u0027s all the work that the\n\nCourt does at step one of Chevron.  That is\n\nusing the tools of interpretation to identify\n\nwhether Congress has spoken to the issue in the\n\ncase and, if so, Chevron said that\u0027s the end of\n\nthe matter. So, in that sense, in a step one\n\ncase, the Court has, of course, interpreted the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n79\n\nOfficial\n\nstatute.\n\nBut, in a situation where, at the end\n\nof that interpretive process, the Court is left\n\nwith no conclusion that it\u0027s actually able to\n\nascertain that Congress has spoken, then, in\n\nthat circumstance, I think the right\n\ninterpretation of the statute is that Congress\n\nleft a gap or maybe created an ambiguity and\n\nsimultaneously vested the agency with the\n\nimportant responsibility, pursuant to an express\n\ndelegation, to administer that statute with the\n\nregulations that have the force of law.\n\nAnd that\u0027s what then tells the Court\n\nwhat the relevant question of law that\u0027s left","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"70","file_name":"Relentless, Inc. v.

reflected in things\n\nlike mandamus practice, where virtually all\n\nexecutive action for the first hundred years of\n\nour nation\u0027s history was reviewed deferentially,\n\nand then it was continued in a long line of\n\ncases from this Court recognizing specifically\n\nthat in a circumstance when you have the\n\nExecutive administering the statute, Congress\n\ncould delegate and could expect for those\n\ndelegations to be respected.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  I think mandamus is a\n\nlittle bit different and the -- the other\n\nextraordinary writs in that they -- that you had\n\nquite a high hurdle before they became\n\napplicable, but back to -- we normally say that\n\nthis Court reviews questions of law de novo, and\n\nthat includes statutory and constitutional.\n\nHeritage

I certainly take the\n\npoint that the Court reviews many legal\n\nquestions de novo, but that\u0027s not invariably the\n\ncase. There can be issues that arise under\n\ndistinct statutes that set forth more\n\ndeferential standards of review.

it\u0027s a statutory\n\ninterpretation question.\n\nAnd you\u0027re saying no, you can stop\n\nshort of that in an agency case at some\n\ndifficult-to-define point and then treat the\n\nrest of the case as a -- as a policy call for\n\nthe executive branch.\n\nAnd that\u0027s treating what was a law\n\nquestion in a non-agency case as a policy\n\nquestion in an agency case, and it\u0027s the same\n\nquestion.

And to the extent that there are\n\nagencies out there or lower courts out there\n\nthat are effectively not giving the -- the\n\neffect to Congress\u0027s own enactments, then a\n\ncourt can police that and it can put into effect\n\nthe Footnote 9 principle in a robust way with a\n\nrigorous analysis. That\u0027s the kind of\n\ninstruction the Court gave in Kisor.\n\nAnd, Justice Kavanaugh, I think it\u0027s\n\nnot a -- a different question in the agency\n\ncontext and in the non-agency context.

They didn\u0027t talk about Congress\u0027s own\n\nreliance interests in enacting statutes against\n\nthe backdrop of Chevron.\n\nSo I think, at this juncture, to say\n\nwe\u0027re actually going to switch the default and\n\nmake Congress say discretion is conferred would\n\nbe really to run to the detriment of Congress\u0027s\n\nown reasonable expectations with respect to\n\ndrafting.\n\nAnd I think it also doesn\u0027t account\n\nfor the category of cases where the language\n\nthat Congress is using is infused with\n\ndiscretion.  They agree to terms like\n\n\"reasonable,\" \"appropriate,\" \"necessary.\"  Those\n\nare terms that require greater application to\n\nconcrete factual settings to fill in the\n\ndetails, and you can\u0027t just interpret those\n\nterms in a vacuum.
