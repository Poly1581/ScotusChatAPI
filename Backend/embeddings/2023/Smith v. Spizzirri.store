ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L.\n\nGEYSER\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR.\n\nGEYSER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nSection 3 unambiguously mandates a\n\nstay pending arbitration, and the FAA\u0027s plain\n\ntext, structure, and purpose confirm that\n\nconclusion.  Congress directed that a court\n\nshall stay the trial of the action until the\n\narbitration is complete.  There is no mention of\n\ndismissal, and there are no exceptions for cases\n\nwhere all claims are subject to arbitration.\n\nIf a court ignores that command and\n\ndismisses, it activates a premature right to\n\nappeal, contrary to the FAA\u0027s reticulated\n\nscheme.  It illuminates the essential backdrop\n\nthat protects litigant rights if a party compels\n\narbitration but abandons the arbitration\n\nprocess, which has happened in this very case.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n4\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd, critically, it invites wasteful disputes\n\nthat pointlessly burden parties and courts as\n\nlitigants fight over whether to stay or dismiss\n\nand then take appeals over whether to stay or\n\ndismiss.\n\nA bright-line rule answers that\n\nprocedural question in a manner that best\n\npreserves judicial and party resources and\n\ndirectly advances the core purpose of the FAA\n\nitself, eliminating waste, avoiding unnecessary\n\nlitigation, and sending parties to arbitration\n\nas quickly as possible.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Smith v.

ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nWhen Congress directed courts to stay\n\nthe trial of a case in deference to arbitration,\n\nit meant stop the litigation in court. It did\n\nnot mean you must retain jurisdiction. It did\n\nnot mean never dismiss, no matter how clear it\n\nis that the case will never come back to court.\n\nI get that modern lawyers often think\n\nof stays and dismissals as two completely\n\ndistinct animals, but when Congress passed\n\nSection 3 a hundred years ago, Congress would\n\nnot have drawn that stark a distinction.  The\n\ndrafters would have understood that a dismissal\n\nwas one way to stay a litigation.\n\nWhen Congress intended that a court\n\nretain jurisdiction, it used those words in\n\nSection 8. Even if that is not the best\n\nunderstanding, this Court should accept it as\n\nlong as it\u0027s plausible.
