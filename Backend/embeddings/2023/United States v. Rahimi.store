distinct\n\nprinciple and the textual hook that at the\n\nparticular point in time those categories of\n\npeople were viewed as being not among the people\n\nprotected by the Second Amendment in the first\n\ninstance.\n\nObviously, that was an odious\n\nclassification, but those laws were generally\n\naccompanied by stripping of other political\n\nrights or ability to -- to participate in the\n\npolitical community, and we think they were\n\njustified at that time on that basis.\n\nAnd so the reason we haven\u0027t invoked\n\nthem here is because we focused on the more\n\ndirectly relevant laws that apply to those who\n\nare indisputably among the people but\n\nnevertheless fit within this enduring\n\nconstitutional principle that the legislature\n\nhas authority to draw lines

think probably the reason the Court\n\nhas used the term \"not responsible\" is it gets\n\nat the idea that some of the categories of\n\npeople who can be disarmed might not intend to\n\nbe dangerous.

With respect\n\nto responsibility in particular, our\n\nunderstanding of what history and tradition\n\nreflect and how this Court has used the term is\n\nthat it\u0027s identifying those whose possession of\n\nfirearms presents an unusual danger beyond the\n\nordinary citizen.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n12\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd, again, I would draw the -- the\n\nanalogy to sensitive places and to dangerous and\n\nunusual weapons.  In each of these contexts, the\n\nCourt is trying to identify those arms that are\n\nespecially dangerous, those places where\n\ncarrying weapons will pose unique dangers, and\n\nthose categories of people who, beyond the\n\nordinary citizen, possess a -- a particular\n\ndanger if they have access to firearms.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  So it\u0027s not a","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"9","file_name":"United States v.

So someone who\n\nposes a risk of domestic violence is dangerous.\n\nHow does the government go about\n\nshowing whether certain behavior qualifies as\n\ndangerous? Because this might be in a\n\nheartland, but then you can imagine more\n\nmarginal cases.\n\nSo you\u0027ve invoked the consensus among\n\nthe states, tradition of dangerousness, and I\n\ndon\u0027t think you\u0027d get a lot of push-back because\n\nthis is violence after all, domestic violence.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"10","file_name":"United States v.

about more marginal cases?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that the\n\nfactors we think courts could apply in this\n\ncontext -- and I should emphasize that this is\n\nsubject to meaningful judicial review -- would\n\nfall into a couple of different categories.\n\nAt the outset, I would take the class\n\nof disarmament provisions that require\n\nindividualized findings of dangerousness and say\n\nthose fall in the heartland, as you just\n\nsuggested.  We have a judicial order here that\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial\n\nspecifically found that Mr. Rahimi\u0027s conduct was\n\ndangerous to his intimate partner.\n\nThen I think you get to the category\n\nof cases where a legislature might be making\n\ncategorical predictive judgments that\n\nindividuals with a certain characteristic or\n\nquality or past conduct present a danger, and\n\nthose, I think, can be harder cases.\n\nBut the factors I would point to first\n\nwould be the breadth of the law, because we know\n\nthat the Second Amendment was entire -- was\n\nintended to prevent disarming wide swaths of the\n\nAmerican public.  So, if it\u0027s sweeping broadly\n\nor indiscriminately and capturing people we\n\nthink of as ordinary citizens, that\u0027s going to\n\nbe a problem.\n\nNext, I would look at the\n\njustifications and the evidence before the\n\nlegislature.

PRELOGAR:  The work that\n\nhistory and tradition are doing is helping to\n\ndiscern those principles in the first place.\n\nThe idea, for example, that you can ban firearms\n\nin sensitive places,

banning of firearms\n\nin places where they present safety concerns can\n\njustify a modern-day regulation that does\n\nrequire the banning of weapons in schools.\n\nAnd so too here, I think the Court can\n\nidentify the constitutional principle, which\n\nit\u0027s already articulated -- we\u0027re not asking the\n\nCourt to break new ground here -- and say today,\n\nSection 922(g)(8) is a clear

error we see is that\n\nRespondent has asserted here and other courts\n\nhave embraced the idea that the only thing that\n\nmatters under Bruen is regulation.  In other\n\nwords, you can\u0027t look at all of the other\n\nsources of history that usually bear on original\n\nmeaning.\n\nAnd I don\u0027t think that that can be\n\nsquared with this Court\u0027s precedents, starting\n\nwith Heller, which consulted a -- a wide variety\n\nof historical sources, the same kind of evidence\n\nwe\u0027ve come forward with here about English\n\npractice, state constitutional precursors,\n\ntreatises, commentary, state judicial decisions.\n\nAll of that is relevant evidence about the scope\n\nof the Second Amendment right, and I think the\n\nCourt could make clear that it\u0027s not a\n\nregulation-only test.\n\nSecond, I think that looking just at\n\nregulations themselves, one of the fundamental\n\nproblems with how courts are applying Bruen is\n\nthe level of generality at which they\u0027re parsing\n\nthe historical evidence.\n\nCourt after court has looked at the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n40\n\nOfficial\n\ngovernment\u0027s examples and picked them apart to\n\nsay: Well, taking them one by one, there\u0027s a","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"33","file_name":"United States v.

I guess what I would do\n\nis describe it as the relevant category, the\n\nshorthand to get at the idea that legislatures,\n\nconsistent with the Second Amendment, can take\n\naction to disarm particular types of people\n\nwhose possession of weapons present these types\n\nof concerns, either that they have committed\n\nserious crimes or present a danger.\n\nAnd I would use this as shorthand in\n\nthe same way the Court has referred to the\n\nsensitive places principle or the dangerous and\n\nunusual weapons principle.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  So could I just say\n\nit\u0027s dangerousness?  Let\u0027s say that I agree with\n\nyou that when you look back at surety laws and\n\nthe affray laws, et cetera, that it shows that\n\nthe legislature can make judgments to disarm\n\npeople consistently with the Second Amendment\n\nbased on dangerousness.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  We certainly --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"42","file_name":"United States v.

I was struck by the data\n\nshowing that armed -- that domestic violence\n\ncalls are the most dangerous type of call for a\n\npolice officer to respond to in this country.\n\nAnd for those officers who die in the line of\n\nduty, virtually all of them are murdered with\n\nhandguns.\n\nSection 922(g)(8) takes account of\n\nthose concerns, and, here, history and tradition\n\nconfirm common sense.  Congress can disarm armed\n\ndomestic abusers in light of those profound\n\nconcerns.\n\nSo we\u0027d ask the Court to correct the\n\nFifth Circuit\u0027s methodological errors and\n\nreverse.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nThe case is submitted.\n\n(Whereupon, at 11:37 a.m., the case\n\nwas submitted.)\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\nOfficial\n\n106\n\n$ absolutely [1] 86:5\n\nabstract [1] 30:9\n\naimed [1] 46:25\n\nair [1] 61:22\n\napologize [1] 87:14\n\napparent [1] 44:4\n\nassertions [1] 22:19","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"93","file_name":"United States v.
