so I think there\u0027s a very serious\n\nArticle III question here that Truck has\n\nessentially glided by in this argument this\n\nmorning, but I want to urge you to take that\n\nvery seriously because it can\u0027t be the case that\n\nwe have, like, a law school seminar or anybody\n\nwho wants to come and talk gets to talk.  The\n\nwhole point of a bankruptcy proceeding is get to\n\na confirmed plan, and the only way to do that is\n\nto weed out the people who have something that\n\nthey want to say and to have different threshold\n\nprovisions.\n\nSo, Justice Thomas, I wanted to get\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n75\n\nOfficial\n\nback to your timing question.

And at confirmation, we are knowing\n\nthen that the creditor is impaired or not\n\nimpaired.\n\nSo those are the two key timing\n\nmechanisms.

That\u0027s the Thorpe\n\ncase out of the Ninth Circuit, the Global case\n\nout of the Third Circuit.\n\nBut, in those situations where there\u0027s\n\nan insurance neutrality provision and the\n\ninsurance company is not able to say with any\n\nproof that its legal obligations are materially\n\naltered, the courts of appeals have said:\n\nYou\u0027re not a party in interest.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, wouldn\u0027t\n\nTruck want to have something to say about the --\n\nthe division that you\u0027ve just cited?\n\nMR.
