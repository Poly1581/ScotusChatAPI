MOOPPAN\n\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\nMR. MOOPPAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nIndividuals who hold public office are\n\nstill private citizens too.  When acting in\n\ntheir personal capacity, they retain their First\n\nAmendment rights to decide who can participate\n\nin a community discussion that they host at\n\ntheir own property.  They are thus free to block\n\nusers from their personal social media pages,\n\nunless they chose to operate those pages in\n\ntheir official capacities instead.\n\nThe only principled and workable test\n\nto determine the capacity in which they acted is\n\nto ask whether they exercised any duties or\n\nauthorities of their job.

That doesn\u0027t\n\nmean that they\u0027re doing their job.\n\nThe way to figure out whether they\u0027re\n\ndoing their job is to figure out whether they\u0027re\n\nusing government resources, whether the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n28\n\nOfficial\n\ngovernment can control what they\u0027re doing,\n\nwhether they\u0027re doing something that only the\n\ngovernment can do.

At that point, we\u0027re\n\nnot talking about a test.  We\u0027re talking about\n\nhow to implement the test. And I think the\n\nthings that the Court should be looking at are\n\nobjective indicia that are capable of\n\ndisentangling the two capacities.\n\nSo things like the use of resources,\n\nthe exercise of supervision, the exercise of\n\nexclusive duties, those are things that will","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"29","file_name":"Oâ€™Connor-Ratcliff v.

if the defendant is\n\nexercising an official duty to provide access,\n\nlike hosting an official school board meeting,\n\nof course, that\u0027s state action. It doesn\u0027t\n\nmatter where it happens.\n\nBut, for other kinds of duties, and\n\nmost important, where it\u0027s ambiguous, where it\u0027s\n\nthe kind of thing a private citizen could do but\n\nalso within a broad description of the\n\nofficial\u0027s responsibilities, there, we think the\n\nnature of the property should be all but\n\ndispositive.  So, if the defendant denies access\n\nto government property, probably state action.\n\nIf the defendant denies access to her\n\nown personal property, she\u0027s probably acting in\n\nher capacity as a private property owner, not as\n\nan agent of the state.

Here, I really do think, if you\n\nlook at this website, you will find one picture\n\nof her children on Christmas, one picture of her\n\nchildren at some school-related event, one\n\npicture of her grandfather at -- on Veterans\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n112\n\nOfficial\n\nDay, and nothing else that is personal, that is\n\nclearly personal as opposed to coming out of her\n\njob.\n\nYou know, here\u0027s the thing to\n\nunderstand, and this goes back to something that\n\nJustice Kagan said earlier, which is there are\n\nFirst Amendment issues on both sides of this\n\ncase. And, here, the First Amendment provides a\n\ntremendous backstop for members of school boards\n\nand the like who want to regulate their sites.\n\nThere are rules about public forums,\n\nthere are rules about time, place, and manner\n\nand the like, and they have a lot of control\n\nover what goes on on these websites.\n\nBut, if you decide the threshold state\n\naction question against my clients here,\n\nrefusing to have -- find state action would have\n\ndevastating consequences for the -- for the\n\npublic because they would be denied access to\n\nthe sites on which their officials are talking\n\nto them and asking for their reactions.\n\nThank you.\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n\ncounsel.\n\nJustice Thomas?\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"103","file_name":"Oâ€™Connor-Ratcliff v.
