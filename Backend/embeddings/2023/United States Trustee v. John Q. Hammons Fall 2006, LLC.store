HANSFORD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and\n\nmay it please the Court:\n\nThis case presents the question that\n\nthis Court left open in Siegel, what the\n\nappropriate remedy is for the uniformity\n\nviolation that resulted when debtors in a small\n\nsliver of cases, four dozen cases, in the two\n\nstates that use bankruptcy administrators did\n\nnot pay the increased quarterly fees mandated by\n\nCongress in the U.S. Trustee districts.\n\nAs this Court has recognized time and\n\nagain, the touchstone of the remedial inquiry is\n\ncongressional intent.

HANSFORD:  So -- so, Justice\n\nSotomayor, kind of three things I want to say in\n\nresponse to that.\n\nFirst, just a small clarification, and\n\nI take that your premise is there was a\n\npre-deprivation remedy in this case, and I think\n\nthat\u0027s absolutely correct.\n\nJust as a clarification, I do think\n\nthat McKesson specifically says, when there is\n\nno pre-deprivation remedy, you can still level\n\nup or level down.  The requirement is, in\n\nhindsight, a uniform scheme which can be level\n\nup or level down.  So I really don\u0027t think the\n\npre-deprivation question goes to which relief is\n\nappropriate.\n\nBut, I -- you know, taking the premise\n\nof your question there was pre-deprivation\n\nrelief, here, I think that the right solution\n\nfor everybody is the same solution that would\n\nhave happened had Respondents filed suit on day\n\none under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The --\n\nthey would have obtained a ruling that would\n\nsay, yes, this is unconstitutionally un-uniform.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n11\n\nOfficial\n\nAnd we look at congressional intent, and\n\ncongressional intent is plainly -- and I think\n\nthe evidence here is overwhelming -- uniformly\n\nhigher fees nationwide, that means the right\n\nremedy is a leveling-up remedy of collecting\n\nadditional fees in the BA districts.

Did -- did that turn on\n\nwhether or not there was a pre-deprivation\n\nhearing?\n\nMS. HANSFORD:  Well, I -- I -- so --\n\nso exactly.  In that case, there wasn\u0027t -- the\n\nCourt didn\u0027t have to say -- it didn\u0027t have to\n\njustify why it was allowed to do\n\nprospective-only relief.  And in AAPC, this\n\nCourt didn\u0027t have to justify why\n\nprospective-only relief were required.\n\nI think, if we lived in Respondents\u0027\n\nworld where almost always prospective-only\n\nrelief was not an option, those cases could not\n\nhave come out the way they did because there\u0027s\n\nno -- there\u0027s no reason that prospective-only\n\nrelief would be constitutionally permissible in\n\nthose cases but not in this one.\n\nAnd I think, again, AAPC is a good\n\nexample.

reimburse the bankruptcy\n\nsystem\u0027s largest users.\n\nIt flies in the teeth of congressional\n\nintent.  It flies in the face of Congress\u0027s\n\nspecific findings in the 2020 Act, which not\n\nonly were that Congress always wanted these to\n\nbe uniform, but also Sections 2(a) and 2(b) of\n\nthe 2020 Act talk about Congress\u0027s specific\n\nintent that the system be self-funded at no cost\n\nto taxpayers.  And the idea that Congress would\n\nchoose a refund remedy of undoing the 2017 Act\n\nflies in the face of congressional intent and\n\nthe democratic process.\n\nWe ask the Court to reject that\n\napproach and to reverse.
