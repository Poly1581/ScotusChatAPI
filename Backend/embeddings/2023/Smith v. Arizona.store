SANTHANAM:  So I -- we respond\n\nwith, you know, that there are three significant\n\npractical limitations on the confrontation right\n\nthat would prevent the sorts of outreach that\n\nthe State and the United States complain of.\n\nThe first is that you have to deal\n\nwith statements.  Most of what experts deal with\n\nare physical evidence, photographs, things found\n\nat a crime scene.  And we\u0027re not suggesting that\n\nan expert can\u0027t rely on that simply because\n\nsomeone else collected that physical evidence.\n\nThe second is, is that the -- even if\n\na statement is involved, it has to be\n\ntestimonial.  So, as this Court has recognized\n\nin Melendez-Diaz, Bullcoming, statements that\n\nare made in a hospital context, for example, for\n\ntreatment purposes aren\u0027t testimonial.\n\nSimilarly, most statements in a -- in the course\n\nof a business that isn\u0027t directed to generating\n\nevidence isn\u0027t going to be testimonial.  And\n\nexperts can rely on all of that.\n\nAnd then, third, I think very\n\ncritically, the State, the prosecution does not\n\nhave to put on every statement to prove its\n\ncase.

FEIGIN\n\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\n\nSUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY\n\nMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\n\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\n\nWe agree with Petitioner that\n\nLongoni\u0027s testimony here may have gone too far.\n\nOur principal interest is in making clear that\n\ncareful application of the federal rules can\n\navoid confrontation concerns.\n\nTwo main points on that.  Number one\n\nis that there\u0027s no confrontation problem when an\n\nexpert comes up and testifies to the expert\u0027s\n\nbare fact of the bottom-line conclusion that the\n\nexpert\u0027s drawn, like these are drugs.  The\n\nproblem comes in when evidence surrounding that\n\nso-called basis evidence or methodology evidence\n\ncomes in.\n\nThe second point is that methodology\n\nevidence can sometimes come in subject to\n\ncareful limiting instructions in some\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n33\n\nOfficial\n\nappropriate cases.\n\nIt\u0027s a little bit hard for me to tell,\n\nadmittedly, but I think Petitioner largely\n\nagrees with us on the first point and to some\n\ndegree on the second point.  So I think the\n\nCourt can resolve this case narrowly without\n\nsuggesting that we need Justice Pryor --\n\nBreyer\u0027s parade of 13 witnesses every time we\n\nwant to introduce a DNA match.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Do you think that\n\nMs. Rast\u0027s notes are testimonial?","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"28","file_name":"Smith v.

Even Petitioner, as I\n\nunderstood them this morning, encourages the\n\nCourt to reach that question, I think, unless\n\nit\u0027s going to come out against them, and then\n\nmaybe issue a narrow ruling.

There\n\nare going to be marginal cases where\n\ncircumstances are different, and it\u0027s going to\n\nbe difficult to apply either the primary purpose\n\ntest, the targeted individual test, or Justice\n\nThomas\u0027s solemnity test.\n\nBut I\u0027d like to emphasize here that\n\nthis is not a marginal case.  This is a case\n\nwhere, under any of those tests, the statements\n\nhere are testimonial. And I\u0027d urge the Court to\n\ntake a look at Pet. App. 127a. That is the\n\nprosecution, the State, telling Rast that this\n\ntrial has been set in Smith\u0027s case, that these\n\nare the charges against him, and that she needs\n\nto create forensic analyses, evidence, to\n\nsupport the prosecution\u0027s case against Mr.\n\nSmith.\n\nAnd it also bears emphasis, if you\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"89","file_name":"Smith v.
