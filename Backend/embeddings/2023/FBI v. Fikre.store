There\n\nsimply isn\u0027t a live case or controversy any\n\nlonger, and this Court should hold as much.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the Respondent\n\nwas also concerned about the propriety of the\n\nprocedures that were used to put him on the list\n\nto begin with and challenged that.\n\nSo how does the declaration that you\n\nall used, how does that change the procedures\n\nthat he thought were violative of his rights?\n\nMR. JOSHI: So two responses.\n\nAs far as a procedural challenge goes,\n\nnumber one, for the post-deprivation procedures,\n\nthose have actually already changed since the\n\ntime he was first on the list.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"3","file_name":"FBI v.

JOSHI: Yeah.  We strongly\n\ndisagree with that, and I don\u0027t think the\n\nevidence they cite actually supports the claim.\n\nI think the ACLU\u0027s brief is probably the most\n\ncomprehensive on this front, but if you look at\n\nthe ACLU\u0027s brief, what they say is -- you know,\n\nsometimes, I -- I think it\u0027s about half or\n\nsomething like that, roughly, of these\n\nplaintiffs are removed from the No Fly List\n\nduring the litigation.\n\nOf course, that\u0027s the -- that\u0027s how\n\nmany U.S. persons are removed from the No Fly\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n49\n\nOfficial\n\nList, just based on the administrative redress\n\nprocess, which is what we think is happening.\n\nSo ACLU documents that, well, some of these\n\nplaintiffs are removed before any briefs are\n\nfiled, and then some are removed after the\n\nbriefs are filed but before a district court\n\ndecision. And then some are removed after the\n\ndecision.  Some are removed on appeal.\n\nAnd I look at all that and I think,\n\nwell, that makes sense because they\u0027re removed","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"45","file_name":"FBI v.

I mean, I heard my friend agree\n\nthat if he brought the suit today or even a day\n\nafter I presume being taken off the list, there\n\nwould be no standing.\n\nAnd if that\u0027s true, I -- I don\u0027t think\n\nyou should interpret mootness as being so\n\ndisconnected from standing that we could find\n\nmootness here even though he\u0027s not on the list,\n\nhasn\u0027t been on it in eight years, and is\n\nguaranteed that that decision to remove him is\n\nsort of sticky, that it won\u0027t be revisited and\n\nhe won\u0027t be put back on, unless there\u0027s some new\n\ninformation that warrants that course of action.\n\nThat\u0027s true with you or I or anyone else.  And\n\nthere\u0027s no reason why he has a live case just\n\nbecause it also happens to be true with respect\n\nto him.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"79","file_name":"FBI v.
