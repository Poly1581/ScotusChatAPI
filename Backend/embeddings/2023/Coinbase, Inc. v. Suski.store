ELLSWORTH:  Well, I -- I think you\n\n-- you -- you could stop there, but in saying\n\nthat you\u0027re remanding the case, I think there\n\nare three important principles that the Ninth\n\nCircuit went astray on that I would recommend\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n14\n\nOfficial\n\nthat this Court provide as guidance because this\n\nis a situation, successive contracts come up not\n\ninfrequently in all sorts of commercial\n\nsettings, consumer settings.\n\nThe first is that the severability\n\nprinciple applies just as much in a successive\n\ncontract scenario as it does to a single\n\ncontract scenario.  That means that the court\n\ncan only entertain challenges directly to the\n\nvalidity or enforceability of the delegation\n\nclause itself.\n\nThe second principle that I think\n\nwould be important to explain is that delegation\n\nclauses can and regularly do direct an\n\narbitrator to resolve disputes about whether an\n\narbitration agreement exists and whether it\n\ncovers a particular dispute.\n\nThe third point I think that this\n\nCourt should make in remanding it is that a\n\ncourt cannot refuse to enforce a delegation\n\nclause based on the court\u0027s view that a later\n\ncontract changes the scope of what disputes are\n\narbitrable because, as I said in -- to -- in\n\nresponse to your earlier question, the force of\n\na delegation clause does not rise or fall on the\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"11","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.

This threshold question is not a\n\ncontroversy regarding the promotion.\n\nAnd I think that\u0027s why, in the\n\ndistrict court, in the court of appeals, in this\n\nCourt, the way Respondents see to get to a\n\ndelegation invalidation is to argue that the\n\narbitration agreement has been narrowed and\n\nthere\u0027s been some corresponding narrowing of the\n\ndelegation clause.\n\nJUSTICE JACKSON: Can we set aside the\n\nway they framed it?  Because I agree it\u0027s a\n\nlittle confusing if you start from the world of\n\nwe have a delegation agreement, then we have a\n\nsubsequent agreement, and the question is to\n\nwhat extent the subsequent agreement is a\n\ncarveout or narrows or whatever.\n\nLet\u0027s say we don\u0027t frame it that way.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"18","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.

The Respondents and the\n\nPetitioners are in agreement on that.  We\u0027re\n\nhere because the Ninth Circuit failed to apply\n\nthe FAA\u0027s federal severability framework and, as\n\na result, failed to do the state law analysis as\n\napplied to the delegation clause that it was\n\nrequired to do.  The Ninth Circuit never asked\n\nwhether the later contract specifically overrode\n\nthe delegation clause under ordinary state law\n\nprinciples.\n\nAnd, Justice Jackson, I think some of\n\nyour questions were getting at how a delegation\n\nclause could actually be overridden in a later\n\ncontract.  And I just want to respond to that\n\nbriefly because I think it could be expressed as\n\nit was in one of your hypotheticals.  It\n\ncould -- a later contract could wipe out\n\narbitration entirely from the parties\u0027 business","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"42","file_name":"Coinbase, Inc. v.
