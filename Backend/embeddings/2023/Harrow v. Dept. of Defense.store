That rule demands a\n\nclear statement from Congress on par with\n\nexplicit language to establish a jurisdictional\n\nrequirement.\n\nAt issue here is whether 5 U.S.C.\n\nSection 7703(b)(1)(A)\u0027s filing deadline is\n\njurisdictional.  Nothing in the text of\n\n(b)(1)(A) suggests that it is. That can end the\n\ninquiry.

Nevertheless, the government\n\nclaims that the only plausible interpretation of\n\n\"pursuant to\" is as necessitating that all the\n\nrequirements of (b)(1)(A) are satisfied.\n\nBut \"pursuant to\" can mean invoking\n\n(b)(1), not satisfying its filing deadline.\n\nThat is how this Court interpreted interlocutory\n\nappellate jurisdiction in -- in removal cases in\n\nBP P.L.C. in 2021.  It held that \"pursuant to\"\n\nmeans invoking a particular statutory provision,\n\nnot satisfying its requirements.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"2","file_name":"Harrow v.

Court\n\nrecognized in John R.

Okay.\n\nI\u0027m sorry.\n\nI -- I\n\nmisunderstood the question.\n\nI think our\n\nargument in our brief and today is that Rule 26\n\ninforms the reading of the statute if it\u0027s not\n\njurisdictional on its own. So even if the\n\nstatute is not jurisdictional under this -- this\n\nCourt\u0027s holding and it reads 1295(a) -- (a)(9)\n\nand 7703(b)(1) and says that -- that there is\n\nnot a jurisdictional rule here, that then leaves\n\nopen the question whether equitable tolling can\n\napply or whether there can be extensions.\n\nAnd at that point, when there is no\n\nlanguage in the statute that speaks to that,\n\nthen you either have the Irwin presumption on\n\nthe one hand that would say yes, we assume\n\nequitable tolling applies, or you have Rule 26,\n\nwhich displaces that presumption and says no, if\n\nCongress hasn\u0027t express -- expressly stated\n\notherwise, then equitable tolling does -- does\n\nnot apply, and that\u0027s where we think Rule 26\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n50\n\nOfficial\n\ncomes into play here.\n\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You think that\n\nquestion\u0027s simple enough for us to resolve here\n\nin addition to the main question?\n\nMS.
