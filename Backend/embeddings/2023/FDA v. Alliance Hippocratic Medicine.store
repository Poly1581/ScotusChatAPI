They now concede they can\u0027t rely on a\n\nstatistical theory of injury like the lower\n\ncourts did.

It\u0027s\n\nspeculative that any of those women would seek\n\ncare from the two specific doctors who asserted\n\nconscience injuries.  And even if that happened,\n\nfederal conscience protections would guard\n\nagainst the injury the doctors face.\n\nAnd there\u0027s no basis to conclude that\n\nany of that would be traceable to the\n\nincremental changes that FDA made in 2016 and\n\n2021 as opposed to the availability of\n\nmifepristone in general.  Respondents\u0027 theories\n\nare too attenuated as a matter of law. The\n\nCourt should say so and put an end to this case.\n\nIf the Court reaches the merits, FDA\u0027s\n\nactions were lawful.

They aren\u0027t required to treat women\n\nwho take mifepristone.  FDA is not directing the\n\nwomen who take the drug to go seek out care from\n\nthese specific doctors.

federal government has never taken\n\nthe position that EMTALA would override an\n\nindividual doctor\u0027s conscience objections.\n\nWe\n\nsaid exactly the opposite. If you go and look\n\nat our Fifth Circuit reply brief in the Texas\n\nlitigation, we disclaimed that understanding of\n\nEMTALA and made clear that we understand the\n\nconscience protections to continue to apply and\n\nshield a doctor who doesn\u0027t want to provide care\n\nin violation of those protections.\n\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Would that be true\n\nin a healthcare desert as well?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So we don\u0027t\n\nthink that EMTALA would override conscience\n\nprotections for the individual doctor.  It, of\n\ncourse, imposes obligations on hospitals, and\n\nhospitals have all kinds of plans in place to\n\naddress these types of contingencies.  You know,\n\nthey have staffing plans.  I understand, as a\n\nmatter of best practices, they often ask for\n\ndoctors to articulate their conscience\n\nobjections in advance so they can take account\n\nof that in staffing.

So I think that\n\nreflects the Court trying to distinguish between\n\nmore concrete, direct demonstrable harms on the\n\none hand and that kind of abstract setback on\n\nthe other hand.\n\nAnd I recognize -- and you -- your\n\nquestion touches on it, Justice Barrett -- that\n\nsome lower courts in particular have seemed to\n\nread -- read Havens to -- to endorse far broader\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n21\n\nOfficial\n\ntheories of standing, including in the\n\nimmigration context.\n\nThe government has been routinely\n\nresisting standing because we think that that\n\nwould essentially mean that any advocacy\n\norganization could say it opposes what the\n\nfederal government is doing and so, therefore,\n\nhas to devote resources to that opposition.\n\nIf that were enough, then every\n\norganization would have standing and it would be\n\na vast expansion of ordinary Article III\n\nprinciples.  So we would welcome an eventual\n\nclarification from this Court on organizational\n\nstanding, but, here, I think that the\n\norganization\u0027s assertion of injury falls in the\n\nbucket of the abstract setback and doesn\u0027t come\n\nclose to the kind of demonstrable harm that was\n\nat issue in Havens.\n\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  General, that\u0027s --\n\nI\u0027m sorry.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"17","file_name":"FDA v.

So I agree that if there were a\n\nreason to think that the -- the reason why\n\nmifepristone is safe up to 10 weeks\u0027 gestation\n\nis because it\u0027s being prescribed by doctors\n\ninstead of nurse practitioners, for example,\n\nthen those changes would be interconnected\n\nbecause one change would effectively be the\n\nsafety net for another.\n\nBut there was nothing like that in\n\nthis record.  The studies that FDA examined\n\ninstead demonstrated that these changes -- and\n\n-- and it was an exhaustive examination -- were\n\nsafe not because there were other different\n\nsafeguards in place to guard against risks but,\n\nrather, because, if you go up to 10 weeks of\n\ngestation, there is no observable increase in\n\nserious adverse events, no matter who\u0027s\n\nprescribing.\n\nSo, in the absence of that kind of\n\ncorrelative effect of the changes, I don\u0027t think\n\nyou can fault the agency for not giving even\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\nOfficial\n\nmore explicit attention to this issue.

doesn\u0027t even merit some -- some comment?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  That is a reasoned\n\nexplanation.\n\nWhat FDA was observing in that\n\npassage is that although it acknowledged the\n\nfact that some of the studies reported\n\nadditional emergency room visits, that didn\u0027t\n\nequate to additional serious adverse events.\n\nAnd, in fact, one of the studies, half\n\nof the women who went to the emergency room\n\ndidn\u0027t get any treatment at all. Many women\n\nmight go because they\u0027re experiencing heavy\n\nbleeding, which mimics a miscarriage, and they\n\nmight just need to know whether or not they\u0027re\n\nhaving a complication.  But, in that kind of\n\ncircumstance, the woman is not having a -- a --\n\na serious adverse event from mifepristone, and\n\nso it doesn\u0027t call into question the safety\n\ndeterminations regarding the drug.\n\nAnd, you know, at the end of the day,\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n30\n\nOfficial\n\nFDA carefully parsed those studies.  It made\n\nspecific determinations about the results to be\n\ngleaned with respect to safety and efficacy.

some increase in\n\nemergency room visits, the question of when that\n\nrises to a sufficient safety risk is up to the\n\nFDA, correct?\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  That\u0027s right.  And,\n\nyou know, FDA acknowledged it, so it\u0027s not like\n\nit overlooked this aspect of the studies.\n\nI also want to emphasize, Justice\n\nSotomayor, that the studies were far from the\n\nonly evidence FDA consulted.  At the time it\n\nacted in 2021, it had real-world experience\n\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of time\n\nwhen the in-person dispensing requirement was\n\nnot enforced, and FDA started by looking at, as\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n31\n\nOfficial\n\na comparative analysis, the two periods of time\n\nwhen you had in-person dispensing and when you\n\ndidn\u0027t and saw that there was no relevant\n\nincrease in serious adverse events or a\n\ndifference between those two time frames. So\n\nthat further supported the safety conclusion.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem with\n\nall drugs is there are complications in\n\nvirtually all of them.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR: Yes, virtually all.\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And at what level","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"26","file_name":"FDA v.

The best evidence of that, I\n\nbelieve, is the FDA\u0027s reply brief.  The\n\ngovernment resorts to the underlying briefs in\n\nthe case to say that there was a contract and an\n\neconomic harm, but this Court\u0027s case\n\nspecifically said that the fact that the harm --\n\nthe nature of the harm was \"non-economic\" did\n\nnot prevent the Court from finding an injury.\n\nIn Havens, the Court looked to two\n\nthings, whether there -- whether there was an\n\nimpairment of the organization\u0027s mission and,\n\nsecond, whether there was an expenditure of\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n64\n\nOfficial\n\nresources.  Both things are satisfied here.\n\nIf you look at how our organizations\n\nhave been harmed, they\u0027ve been forced to divert\n\nresources from speaking and advocating for their\n\npro-life mission generally to explaining the\n\ndangers of the harm from abortion drugs.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that that\u0027s\n\nrequired is because, in 2016, FDA took away the\n\nrequirement that abortion providers report\n\nadverse events --\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well --\n\nMS.
