STETSON: I think, Justice\n\nSotomayor, that that\u0027s actually EPA\u0027s argument,\n\nis that, you know, it -- it makes sense to\n\nimpose these emissions controls across these\n\nindustries because it will result in what EPA\n\ncalls meaningful reductions.\n\nNow I\u0027d encourage you to look at page\n\n36743 and 36747 to figure out exactly the scope\n\nof those meaningful reductions of the 88 Federal\n\nRegister final rule.  What we\u0027re talking about\n\nwhen it comes to meaningful reductions is on the\n\norder of a total of .66 parts per billion\n\naveraged across all of these receptors.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n39\n\nOfficial\n\nNow there\u0027s a bigger number involved.\n\nThat number is, if you add all of the reductions\n\nfrom the receptors from Arizona to Connecticut\n\nand you add them up, then you get a bigger parts\n\nper billion number, but that\u0027s like ticketing me","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"35","file_name":"Ohio v.

the Court:\n\nI\u0027d like to make three quick points at\n\nthe outset.  First, with respect to the\n\ninterests of the state applicants, I think it\u0027s\n\nimportant to bear in mind that at this stage of\n\nthe proceedings, there are a lot more states on\n\nour side than there are on theirs, and it\u0027s\n\nvital to bear in mind the equities of the\n\ndownwind states because that\u0027s the whole point\n\nof the Good Neighbor provision of the Clean Air\n\nAct and the Good Neighbor Plan that the EPA\n\nimplemented.  And when we think about the\n\ninterests of the downwind states, it\u0027s natural\n\nto think first of their humanitarian interest in\n\nthe health and well-being of their residents.\n\nBut the downwind states that are out of\n\nattainment also have a legal obligation to come\n\ninto attainment by deadlines specified by the\n\nstatute.\n\nAnd to stay the rule in its entirety\n\nbased on some theoretical possibility that the\n\ncontours of an 11-state rule might have been\n\nsomewhat different if EPA had anticipated all\n\nthe stays would be terribly unfair to the\n\ndownwind states.\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"42","file_name":"Ohio v.

is that in addition\n\nto the severability language that Justice\n\nKavanaugh referred to, EPA in the preamble said\n\nthat it was reserving judgment on whether\n\nseveral additional states should ultimately be\n\nincluded in the plan.  It said that if any of\n\nthe 23 states that were currently included\n\ndevised compliant SIPs, they could be taken out\n\nof the federal plan.\n\nAnd so EPA anticipated from the outset\n\nthat the plan was one whose geographic\n\ncomposition could change.  And EPA devised the\n\nrequirements for each state in order that they\n\nwould be workable if a smaller or a larger set\n\nof states were ultimately covered.\n\nAnd then the last thing I would say is\n\nit\u0027s true that the federal plan is not currently\n\nproviding the air quality benefits that EPA had\n\nhoped because the stays of the SIP plan\n\ndisapprovals mean it\u0027s only reducing emissions\n\nfrom 11 states rather than 23.
