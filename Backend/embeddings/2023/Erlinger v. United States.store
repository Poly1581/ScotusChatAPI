In case after case, this\n\nCourt has held that judges applying ACCA may\n\nfind only what crime with what -- what crime\n\nwith what elements a defendant was previously\n\nconvicted of, nothing more.\n\nAnd the Court has grounded that rule\n\ndirectly in the Sixth Amendment.

Their front-line\n\nposition is that judges can find only the\n\nelements of prior offenses.  But they concede\n\nthat Almendarez-Torres authorizes judges to find\n\nvarious non-elemental facts as well.

why is that?\n\nMR.\n\nHARPER: So for a few reasons.\n\nI\n\nthink, first of all, they -- their principle in\n\nthis case, which I think Mr. Fisher reiterated\n\nin his opening, was that -- this elements-only\n\nprinciple, this principle that judges can only\n\nfind facts that juries previously found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\nAnd I just don\u0027t think that their\n\ntheory, their -- their test that they end up\n\narticulating line up with that principle because\n\nthey recognize that if the Court were to\n\ndouble-down on that elements-only principle, it\n\nwould blow up the categorical -- categorical\n\napproach because judges, in doing predicate\n\nfelony determinations, often find facts that are\n\nnot elements of prior offenses, like identity,\n\nlike the date of the offense, like the\n\nsequencing issue in Almendarez-Torres itself.\n\nSo they articulate -- they have to\n\nfall back from their elements-only principle,\n\nand they end up articulating standards like

Even in 1967, when the Court looked\n\nat this issue in Spencer, it noted that the\n\nmajority of the states require bifurcation by\n\nstatute.
