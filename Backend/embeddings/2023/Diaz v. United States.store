I want to emphasize three points this\n\nmorning.\n\nFirst, when Congress enacted Rule\n\n704(b) in response to the acquittal of John\n\nHinckley, Congress adopted a reform that applies\n\nequally to both sides.  It is party agnostic, as\n\nJustice Gorsuch observed this morning.  It is\n\nnot a rule targeted at government experts.  And\n\nwhatever the Court says in this case will also\n\ngovern future expert testimony offered by the\n\ndefense on issues like insanity or battered\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n58\n\nOfficial\n\nwomen syndrome.\n\nSecond, Congress kept Rule 704(a) in\n\nplace. The general rule in federal court\n\ncontinues to be that opinion testimony is not\n\nobjectionable merely because it embraces an\n\nultimate issue. Rule 704(b) operates as a\n\nlimited exception to that general rule.\n\nAnd, third, the original text of Rule\n\n704(b) confirms that an expert may still testify\n\nwith respect to the mental state or condition of\n\nthe defendant, as long as the expert stops short\n\nof opining on the ultimate issue.  Agent Flood\n\nrespected that limitation here.\n\nI welcome the Court\u0027s questions.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  But Mr. Fisher makes\n\nthe point that in effect, when you talk about\n\nthe probable -- probabilities of someone","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"52","file_name":"Diaz v.

me give you one last scenario\n\nabout the government\u0027s line-drawing problems.\n\nThere\u0027s a case called Watson from the Third\n\nCircuit that\u0027s in our brief.  The government\n\nitself seems to agree with the outcome in\n\nWatson.  In that case, the prosecutor asked the\n\nexpert: Do you have an opinion as to whether or\n\nnot the defendant here had the requisite intent?\n\nThe expert says:  Yes, I have an opinion.\n\nPeople like this generally have the requisite\n\nintent.\n\nThe government seems to agree that is\n\nout under Rule 704(b).  Now maybe that\u0027s\n\nbecause, at pages 28 to 30, it draws a\n\ncontextual rule of some kind.  But there are\n\nthese very difficult line-drawing problems under\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n104\n\nOfficial\n\nthe government\u0027s rule.\n\nOur rule is simple.  If you talk about\n\n\"the\" defendant herself, it\u0027s -- it\u0027s covered by\n\nRule 704(b), or a class of people including the\n\ndefendant, you\u0027re talking -- you\u0027re covered by\n\nRule 704(b).  Here, the class of people, Agent\n\nFlood is quite specific, people carrying large\n\nquantities of drugs across the border.  That\u0027s\n\nthe class.  The defendant here is unquestionably\n\na member of that class.

class.\n\nThe defendant here is unquestionably\n\na member of that class.\n\nAnd so his testimony is\n\nabout the defendant.\n\nI want to say one last thing.  Justice\n\nKagan and Justice Jackson asked about some of\n\nthe history and intent of Rule 704(b).  Let\u0027s\n\njust use the Hinckley case.  And the Senate\n\nreport is only a page long.  I would urge you to\n\nread that if you think that\u0027s important here.\n\nAnd what the Senate said was, we\u0027re concerned\n\nabout experts testifying about the subject of\n\nmens rea.\n\nAnd so, after the Hinckley trial, if\n\nan expert were to testify we think people like\n\nthis who are exhibiting these conditions\n\ngenerally couldn\u0027t tell right from wrong or\n\nprobably couldn\u0027t tell right from wrong or in\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n105\n\nOfficial\n\nmost circumstances couldn\u0027t tell right from\n\nwrong, it seems crazy to think Congress would\n\nhave thought that was okay under the Hinckley\n\ntrial.\n\nThe problem in the Hinckley trial was\n\nthat the expert was testifying not just about\n\nfacts from which a jury could infer mens rea,\n\nbut the jury was expressing an opinion on the\n\nultimate issue of mens rea from which the jury\n\ncould go into the jury room and do nothing but\n\nsay, oh, we agree with the expert.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"97","file_name":"Diaz v.
