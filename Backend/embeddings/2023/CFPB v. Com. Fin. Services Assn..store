emphasize that our\n\nargument here also relies heavily on history.\n\nAnd so, if you have in mind some kind of\n\nfunding statute or arrangement that\u0027s never\n\nbeen done in all of this nation\u0027s history, I\n\nthink the Court could take that into account in\n\na future case.\n\nHere, though, we have a specific type\n\nof appropriation, a capped lump-sum\n\nappropriation that\u0027s standing for a single\n\nagency, and our historical argument is that\n\nthis is nothing new or unprecedented.  All of\n\nthe agencies I previously listed had similar\n\nappropriations.\n\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Are there any -- is\n\nthere any role in appropriations -- that --\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n8\n\nOfficial\n\nthat appropriations plays in the separation of\n\npowers?

It would\n\neffectively take the whole of Congress\u0027s\n\nappropriations authority and transfer it to the\n\nexecutive branch.\n\nCongress has never done that for the\n\npast 230-plus years, and it\u0027s hard for me to\n\nimagine Congress ever would do that.  But I\n\nthink, if the Court were confronted with that\n\nissue in a future case, it could well recognize\n\nlimits and the limits would come from history.\n\nThe Court, in -- in any number of\n\nseparation of powers cases, has said that the\n\nfact that a method of structuring government\n\nhas no historical precedent can strongly\n\ncounsel against recognizing it as a\n\nconstitutional way to proceed.  That was the\n\nanalysis the Court said in Free Enterprise\n\nFund. It repeated it in Seila Law.\n\nBut that history works both ways.  The\n\nCourt has likewise said that the fact that a\n\nway of structuring government is well rooted in\n\nhistory and traces back to the founding is\n\npowerful evidence of the contemporaneous\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n27\n\nOfficial\n\nunderstanding of original intent, and that\u0027s\n\nthe box we\u0027re in here.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"21","file_name":"CFPB v.

a discussion sometimes about\n\npermanent appropriations and forever\n\nappropriations.\n\nMy understanding, but I want to make\n\nsure you agree, is that Congress could not\n\nentrench a funding scheme, in other words,\n\nCongress could not pass a law that says this is\n\nthe funding scheme and no future Congress may\n\nalter this for 10 years or a hundred years.\n\nThat would be constitutionally problematic, is\n\nmy understanding, and I want to make sure you\n\nagree with that.\n\nGENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, I absolutely\n\nshare that understanding, Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nAnd I think what it shows is that it\u0027s\n\nincorrect to characterize standing\n\nappropriations as lasting forever.\n\nHeritage Reporting

a standing\n\nappropriation for the first 120 years of this\n\nnation\u0027s history, and then, in 1912, Congress\n\ntook it out of a standing appropriation and\n\nbrought it into annual appropriations.\n\nCongress just did this again in the\n\ndebt limit bill recently.  It rescinded many\n\nstanding appropriations that had been part of\n\nthe American Rescue Plan and the Inflation\n\nReduction Act, and I think it just demonstrates\n\nthat there is always that additional check of a\n\nfuture Congress deciding that it wants to alter","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"35","file_name":"CFPB v.

concerned that there might be\n\nburden-shifting happening in the way in which\n\nwe\u0027re thinking about this, and so maybe you can\n\nhelp me just to keep the -- the right burdens\n\nin the right place.\n\nSome of the questions that have been\n\nasked this morning are -- seem to be requiring\n\nyou to establish whether or not Congress can do\n\ncertain things, can -- you know, what if\n\nCongress, you know, delegated the authority to\n\n-- to determine a trillion dollars worth of\n\nfunding and how the agency was going to do it?\n\nWhat if Congress set it up in this way or that\n\nway, et cetera?\n\nBut I sort of thought that the burden\n\nwas on them to show that Congress can\u0027t set up\n\nthe agency in this way, and the reason I think\n\nthat is because of the language of the\n\nAppropriations Clause and the way in which it\n\nseems to give the legislature the prerogative\n\nof the purse.  And, here, we have a statute in\n\nwhich the legislature has exercised that.\n\nSo am I right that that\u0027s really all\n\nyou need to say to win?

Congress has\n\nnever authorized an agency to pick its own\n\nperpetual appropriation, and if it can do that\n\nfor the CFPB, it can do it for every other\n\nagency too.\n\nSecond, the government points to\n\nfounding-era fee-for-services agencies like the\n\nPost Office and their modern analogues.  But\n\nnone of those can demand whatever they want.\n\nInstead, they\u0027re limited to what they can\n\ncollect from the people that they serve and\n\nregulate.  That\u0027s why Congress rejected that\n\nmodel for the CFPB.  They thought it made the\n\nagency too politically accountable.","metadata":{"metadata":{"absolute_directory_path":"C:\\Users\\polyp\\Desktop\\embeddings\\transcripts\\2023","index":"41","file_name":"CFPB v.

-- Justice Barrett, with respect to\n\nyour question, when it comes to delegation, I\n\nthink it\u0027s particularly problematic with\n\nrespect to the Appropriations Clause.\n\nRemember, the Appropriations Clause isn\u0027t in\n\nSection 8 of Article I, it\u0027s in Section 9 of\n\nArticle I.\n\nSo it is both a -- it is not just a\n\nprivilege of Congress, it\u0027s an obligation and a\n\nduty that Congress has to check the executive\n\nbranch.  And if it can simply transfer to the\n\nexecutive its duty to check the executive, you\n\nare unifying the sword and purse.\n\nSo, to the extent that there\u0027s any\n\ndelegation allowed in the context of setting\n\nthe amount of the appropriation, it\u0027s got to be\n\na very narrow one.  And that is a perfect\n\nexplanation for the founding-era \"sums not\n\nexceeding\" statutes.\n\nThose were statutes where Congress, in\n\nan annual appropriation, fixed the amount that\n\nit thought that the government should be\n\nspending based on Hamilton\u0027s detailed\n\nestimates, often down to the penny.

Congress\n\ndetermined what fees they could collect or what\n\nformula they could use to collect those fees.\n\nAnd, in addition, it was supervised by\n\nthe Department of the Treasury, which it was\n\nitself subject to annual appropriations.

But two things\n\nabout that.  It was still subject to the\n\nsupervision of the Secretary of the Treasury,\n\nand that turned out not to be enough.

in Scenario Number 1, we have a\n\nConstitution that gives the legislature the\n\npower of the purse, and it specifies what that\n\nauthority entails.  It says:  To exercise the\n\npower of the purse, you have to select a fixed\n\nsum of money on an annual basis and tell the\n\nrecipient exactly how it must be spent.\n\nI think, if that\u0027s our Constitution,\n\nthen I might well agree with you that this\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n97\n\nOfficial\n\nagency structure is giving up that power\n\nbecause, in fact, those determinations about\n\nhow much is being spent and et cetera would be\n\ngiven to the agency, and the Constitution tells\n\nus that the legislature has to exercise that\n\nauthority.\n\nMy problem is Scenario 2, which is the\n\nConstitution giving the legislature the power\n\nof the purse, and it defines the power of the\n\npurse as the power to decide how government\n\ndepartments are funded, period.  That\u0027s what\n\nthe Constitution says. It\u0027s got a definition\n\nsection, and it says, when we say \"power of the\n\npurse,\" we mean you have the ability to decide\n\nhow the government is funded.\n\nIf that\u0027s your constitutional\n\nprovision, I think you have a harder -- harder\n\ntime, if not almost an impossible time,\n\nconvincing me at least that by setting this\n\nagency up this way in which Congress has --\n\nMR.

and ask for\n\nadditional appropriations authority.\n\nMy friend also suggested that there\n\nwas something constitutionally suspicious about\n\nstanding appropriations.  But I didn\u0027t hear any\n\nengagement with the text of the Army\n\nAppropriations Clause.\n\nThe Framers thought about this issue.\n\nThey did want to limit Congress when it came to\n\nfunding for the Army to create that durational\n\nrequirement, but they wrote no other limit into\n\nthe Constitution.  And this too would have\n\nsweeping consequences because today, over\n\n60 percent of the federal budget comes in the\n\nform of these kinds of standing appropriations\n\nthat exist in every sector of the federal\n\ngovernment.\n\nAnd then, at some point, I think my\n\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n109\n\nOfficial\n\nfriend had suggested that it\u0027s all of these\n\nfeatures combined that add up to a\n\nconstitutional problem here.\n\nAnd, Justice Alito, I want to engage\n\nwith your question about the limits.
